            "Beyond that, opinions varied; some believed the trial would be fair; others saw it as a sham. Regarding the issue of jury selection, they had good reasons for concern: the makeup of the jury lies at the heart of the matter, and will determine whether the trial is fair. ",
            "Too often, US juries have skewed towards white people, and the selection of the jurors has been biased. Local demographics also posed challenges, as the state is 80% white, but most believed the jury should represent a more diverse group. ",
            "The final group - nine white jurors, four Black jurors, and two who describe themselves as multiracial - embodies a diverse mix, and may help instil faith that the jury selection, and the trial itself, so far, appears to be just. ",
            "Mr Chauvin is accused of unintentional second-degree murder as well as third-degree murder. Experts say the latter charge is easier to prove. ",
            "To convict on a second-degree murder charge, prosecutors must prove that a serious assault had been committed by Mr Chauvin, and that it was a \"substantial causal factor\" in Mr Floyd's death. ",
            "For third-degree murder, the jury must be convinced that Mr Chauvin showed a reckless disregard for human life, but not that the assault led to death. ",

            "Fourteen jurors, who will remain anonymous and unseen throughout the televised trial, will decide whether Mr Chauvin should serve time in prison or be acquitted.",
            "Whatever the final verdict in this highly publicised case, it will likely have implications for the Black Lives Matter movement and the future of policing in the US.",
            "Selecting jurors in an emotionally charged case over a black man's death at the hands of a white police officer was no easy feat, but it was made even more complicated in the George Floyd case because of how well known his death was.",
            "After 11 days worth of summons, the two opposing legal teams settled on 15 Minnesota residents out of a jury pool of over 130 people.",
            "Among that group, 14 - including two alternates - will be sworn in next Monday, while the 15th juror is a backup option, in case a juror drops out before the trial begins.",
            "The jury panel skews younger, more white and more female. ",
            "It includes a black grandmother in her 60s, the oldest member of the jury, who said she stopped watching the infamous video of Mr Floyd's death because \"it just wasn't something I needed to see\". She also claimed she used to live 10 blocks from where he had died.",
            "Others too admitted that they found the video difficult to watch, with one newly-wed white woman, a social worker in her 20s, saying \"I had every emotion\".",
            "The Floyd video may become the centrepiece of this trial, but prospective jurors were also questioned about their opinions on the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement, the opposing Blue Lives Matter movement (which advocates for police officers), the push among activists to \"defund the police\" and the violence associated with some BLM protests.",
            "A white woman in her 50s claimed she used to work at a suburban business damaged last summer after Mr Floyd's death. She had seen the video, but said she generally trusted the police and felt that those who followed instructions had nothing to fear.",
            "A black man in his 40s said that, while he believed minorities are mistreated regularly by the police, he strongly disagreed with defunding - or redirecting funds away from - police departments.",
            "In Hennepin County, where the trial is being held, white people make up nearly three-quarters of the population, according to US census data.",
            "It is also home to a large immigrant population, slightly higher than the national average. ",
            "So the makeup of the jury is \"a mixed bag\", argues Jason Nichols, a progressive political and social analyst who teaches African American Studies at the University of Maryland.",
            "He says jurors will find the visuals of Mr Floyd's death deeply affecting: \"Once you turn that video on, it's hard to watch. We saw, in its aftermath, that was the highest Black Lives Matter had ever polled.\"",
            "\"But imagine you're somebody who looks at that situation and thinks 'that could be me,'\" he added, in a nod to the six people of colour on the jury.",
            "Mr Nichols cautions, however, that we cannot pre-judge how a juror will operate.",
            "Some of the white jurors may be progressives who view the Floyd video as \"an egregious case of racism\", he said, whereas the other ones may not \"see their husbands or fathers\" in Mr Floyd if the defence portrays him as a 6-foot-4 black man under the influence of drugs and behaving erratically.",
            "At least one black juror is an immigrant, not an African American, and Mr Nichols says \"they may not see themselves in George Floyd because their connection to police brutality is different\".",
            "Regardless of background, he said: \"It's going to be really interesting to see where the American people are, how unified we are and how willing to accept evidence, whether it's positive or negative.\"",
            "All potential jurors completed a 16-page questionnaire before arriving in the courtroom. Questions asked them to weigh in on policing in the US, racial discrimination, Black Lives Matter, Blue Lives Matter, their own interactions with police and their level of familiarity with the Floyd case.",
            "Inside the heavily-guarded courtroom, Judge Peter Cahill swore in each person before they were questioned one-by-one, a process known as voir dire.",
            "Mr Chauvin's lead attorney, Eric Nelson, posed questions on behalf of the defence, while Steve Schleicher questioned members of the jury pool for the prosecution.",
            "Each juror was only identified by a number. No names, addresses or other identifying details will be revealed at any time and they will not be shown on screen.",
            "A sensitive process was made even more complicated last week, when the city of Minneapolis settled a wrongful death civil suit with the family of Mr Floyd for a record $27m (£19.7m), the largest in the state's history.",
            "It forced Judge Cahill to dismiss two jurors who had been previously selected, as well as excuse at least three prospects, after they admitted the payout had influenced their opinions on the case.",
            "Members of the jury pool who were excused often expressed strongly negative views on Mr Floyd, Mr Chauvin or other related topics.",
            "One woman, a nursing assistant, told the court she joined a protest after Mr Floyd's death because she believed: \"It was not his time to die, and the incident should not have gone as far as it did.\"",
            "Another woman, a mother of five, denounced the violence in the wake of Mr Floyd's killing, saying: \"There is more crime than there was before. The reputation of the city seems to have taken a hit.\"",
            "It is all a sign of just how high the stakes in this trial are.",
            "Mary Frances Berry, a former chairwoman of the US Commission on Civil Rights, says the trial will be \"a test of whether the Black Lives Matter protests still have potency\".",
            "Ms Berry says \"even under the best circumstances, police officers are not convicted of murder and can argue that what they did was reasonable\".",
            "\"We're at a moment when whether or not we are going to do something about reforming police is very much contested,\" says Ms Berry, who noted the jury's verdict must be unanimous.",
            "If Mr Chauvin is convicted, she says it will be \"a departure\" from past practice and will \"send a signal to police that these kind of behaviours are not valid\".",
            "But if he is not, \"it signals that, no matter how bad the behaviour and no matter what you see with your own eyes, police are so supported and they can get away with killing unarmed people under these circumstances\", she said.",
            "Mr Nichols agrees, calling it \"a pivotal moment in our culture\". He says African Americans have seen several miscarriages of justice, especially in recent years, and does not view the justice system as valuing their lives.",
            "A conviction for Mr Chauvin will bring only \"a brief sigh of relief\", he believes, \"because we're only waiting unfortunately - until we have real systemic change - for the next George Floyd situation\".",
            "\"Justice looks at the facts and justice makes a fair determination. And, thus far, we have not seen that,\" he said.",
            "\"People are going to pay attention to this trial.\""

            "Officers arrived and handcuffed him, but when they tried to put him into the squad car he resisted, and a struggle ended with Mr Floyd face-down on the street.",
            "That's when onlookers began filming.",
            "Mr Chauvin, 44, placed his left knee between Mr Floyd's head and neck, and kept it there for seven minutes and 46 seconds, according to prosecutors. Two other officers helped pin him down, while another prevented witnesses from intervening.",
            "More than 20 times Mr Floyd said he could not breathe. The video shows him go limp and get carried away by police.",
            "He was pronounced dead in hospital an hour later.",

            "The contentious process will see lawyers for both sides question dozens - or possibly hundreds of candidates - and eventually choose 16 people.",
            "Twelve jurors will be seated to decide the case, with four other alternates chosen as backups.",
            "Potential jurors have already submitted questionnaires, describing their existing knowledge of the case, any previous contact with police and their media habits.",
            "Each side can remove a potential juror from the panel, but if either side believes a juror has been relieved due to discrimination based on race, ethnicity or sex, opposing lawyers can issue a \"Batson challenge\". ",
            "The judge then decides whether the juror stays or goes.",
            "The four police officers at the scene were fired the following day as crowds took to the streets of Minneapolis to protest. The station where they worked was set ablaze and protests quickly spread to other cities.",
            "By the sixth night, there were protests in 75 cities across the US - some violent - and a national debate about police brutality against African-Americans was reignited.",

            "Three other dismissed officers will stand trial together later this year, but proceedings in Mr Chauvin's trial will start on Monday, when jury selection begins.",
            "A pool of eligible local citizens has been called to appear by Hennepin County in Minnesota. From them, a jury of 12 and four alternates will be selected. It could take weeks.",
            "Although it is highly unlikely potential jurors will have no prior knowledge of the case - George Floyd's death in May last year in Minneapolis inspired weeks of global protests - they will be questioned to determine whether they will be able to judge Derek Chauvin fairly.",
            "The prosecution and defence can both ask Judge Peter Cahill to dismiss a potential juror \"for cause\" if they perceive bias. The prosecution can also dismiss nine potential jurors - and the defence team 15 - without giving any reason, although this can be objected to.",
            "Once 16 people have been approved, the jury can be seated. The trial itself will not begin until 29 March. ",
            "Each potential juror has already been asked to fill in a 16-page questionnaire about the case.",
            "The main thrust is to determine familiarity with the case and issues such as a potential juror's own interactions with law enforcement.",
            "Key questions include:",
            "How potential jurors respond can lead to either defence or prosecution dismissing them.",
            "Prof Valerie Hans, a jury researcher based at Cornell Law School, says the questionnaire is more detailed and personal than most pre-trial documents, and asks about their \"deepest attitudes on some of the most important political and social topics of the day\".",
            "Prof Hans says the aim for the two teams is to get \"a sense of whether or not a prospective juror will be open to the kinds of arguments that they intend to make over the course of the trial\".",
            "The selection process is different from the UK. Jury trials there are less common, and jurors - picked at random - don't know which trial they will serve on until they've been sworn in. Jurors can only be dismissed by a judge in very specific circumstances.",
            "In cases involving issues such as racism, the selection process can be seen as hugely important to the outcome of the trial and how fair it is perceived. A lack of diversity could lead to questions about the legitimacy of the verdict.",
            "The jury pool in Hennepin County was 80% white and 8% black in the financial year to September 2020, the New York Times reported, a bigger gap than for Minneapolis as a whole (64% to 19%).",
            "The vetting system does try to ensure that a cross-section of society is represented, but at the same time, both defence and prosecution will be looking for jurors that will bring them a favourable outcome.",
            "In high-stakes trials, they often use special consultants who look at factors such as the jurors' backgrounds and even their body language.",
            "Prof Hans says the judge will need to keep a close eye on patterns emerging among dismissals of potential jurors by the prosecution or defence, as this cannot be done on race grounds.",
            "In general terms, legal experts say white jurors are less likely to convict law enforcement officials, although it is in unclear how much of this has changed following the worldwide reaction to the Floyd case.",
            "The chosen jurors will be partially sequestered, or isolated, during the trial and fully sequestered once deliberation starts. They will also remain anonymous until the judge allows their identities to be made public. ",
            "It's not uncommon for US jurors to speak out about their deliberations afterwards, and in some infamous examples, like the OJ Simpson trial, some have even gone on to write books about their experiences.",
            "The high-profile video of George Floyd's death brought an outpouring of anger in the US and beyond, but securing a legal conviction is another matter.",
            "The first issue is the charges. To convict of second-degree murder, jurors must find that Mr Chauvin had committed, or was trying to commit, a felony that caused the death.",
            "Second-degree manslaughter would mean Mr Chauvin had consciously taken the chance of causing death or injury through his negligent actions.",
            "The defence will point to Floyd's health issues or drug consumption as a likely cause of death - although the judge has already written that the prosecution only has to prove Mr Chauvin's actions were a \"substantial causal factor\".",
            "The defence will also argue Mr Chauvin was authorised to use force in his role as a police officer, in an attempt to undermine the accusation that he was trying to commit a felony.",
            "The prosecution will rely on the strong video evidence, pointing to the length of time Floyd's neck was pressed as passers-by pleaded for him, and alleging that the officer broke police department policy.",
            "It will also submit evidence of Mr Chauvin's actions in separate cases. This will include an instance where the officer restrained a female by placing his knee on her neck."

            "However, Plaid Cymru argued the changes were not included in the school curriculum law, passed in the Senedd last week, but instead in a code which could be changed or got rid of by ministers. ",
            "The Welsh government said this was \"incorrect\" and the teaching of BAME stories would be required in every school.",
            "Wales' new curriculum, set to be introduced in 2022, is based on six \"areas of learning and experience\" and does not set out exactly what schools should be teaching.",
            "However, the changes will now mean all learning areas will need to reflect the diverse experiences and contributions of BAME communities and individuals to both past and present Wales.",
            "Following worldwide protests after the death of George Floyd in US police custody, there were calls for greater recognition of Wales' role in colonialism and slavery to be taught in schools.",
            "Prof Charlotte Williams, who led a working group set up by the Welsh government to look at how BAME contributions through history was taught in schools, said there was considerable evidence of \"racial inequality\" in Wales' education system.",
            "She said the new curriculum was an opportunity for \"significant change\", and it was the right of \"every child to learn about histories and contributions that have shaped the Welsh nation\".",
            "In a report published on Friday, Prof Williams said with schools able to set their own curriculum under the national framework BAME histories could \"continue to be marginalised or ignored\", unless made mandatory.",
            "While learning about diversity, identity and equality is mandatory under the new curriculum, there is no requirement for schools to teach pupils about slavery, the British Empire, or the Holocaust, Ms Williams writes.",
            "Prof Williams said this was concerning as these areas were \"topics of central understanding to the histories of racism and diversity\".",
            "In 2019, 12% of all pupils aged five and over came from minority ethnic backgrounds, but this differs widely across Wales, from 34.4% in Cardiff to 4.1% in Anglesey, according to Pupil Level Annual School Census data.",
            "Fewer than 1% of teachers in Wales say they are black, Asian, or from other or mixed minority ethnic backgrounds, according to the 2019-20 school workforce census.",
            "Forty of the 1,065 students who began training to become teachers in Wales in 2018-19 said they were from a minority ethnic group.",
            "Prof Williams, who has previously spoken about growing up in Llandudno where her family were the only black family, said children were being \"failed\" by a lack of positive role models in schools and a curriculum that did not represent their histories.",
            "She said all children should be able to learn about diverse history and talent regardless of their background or where they lived.",
            "The report states that current resources to support the teaching of ethnic minority themes is disproportionately focused on slavery, colonialism and Empire, and that positive contributions and role models needed to be celebrated.",
            "The report makes 51 recommendations for changes in the new curriculum and teacher training including:",
            "The Welsh government has said all of the recommendations in the report had been accepted, and it had allocated £500,000 to help with their implementation.",
            "Ms Williams said: \"Our new curriculum can only be enriched by revealing the diversity of perspectives and contributions made by the ethnic minority communities to the development of Wales across its history and in the present.\"",
            "Angel Ezeadum, member of UK Youth Parliament for Cardiff, said it was a relief that \"finally we are doing something\" to tackle racism and inequality.",
            "The 16-year-old student said she hoped the changes would lead to the next generation of pupils having more opportunity to have a \"different mindset to perhaps their parents or grandparents\".",
            "\"If we want a society which is better for all, where there's equality, and there's fair representation then we need this,\" she said.",
            "\"It's massive in terms of shaping who young people are going to be in the future whether that's a police officer, a teacher, a politician.\"",
            "Plaid Cymru's education spokeswoman Sian Gwenllian said that schools were not required to deliver Welsh history under the newly-passed curriculum law, which was a \"major flaw\".",
            "While teaching humanities is one of the learning areas under law, Welsh history and the teaching of BAME stories is included in statutory guidance, called the What Matters Code.",
            "\"It has the potential of being transformational in the way our society is developing...and it has been left out [of the law],\" Ms Gwenllian said.",

            "By the end of May it was gone, a heap of rubble and ashes, consumed by the inferno that destroyed the police station and many of the businesses around it. ",
            "The image of the burning precinct, abandoned by police in the face of angry and violent protesters, signalled for him that something different was happening in Minneapolis.",
            "This was the station where the four policemen charged in the killing of George Floyd worked. The explosive reaction to his slow and gruesome death, his neck pinned to the ground by an officer's knee, created momentum to change the way not only the city, but the country, is policed.",
            "Nearly five months on, however, ambitious policy efforts to address police violence in Minneapolis have slammed into bureaucratic roadblocks and public opposition. ",
            "In the charged atmosphere after the Floyd killing, city counsellor Alondra Cano says she \"knew in my gut that we had to do something different… to send a message nationally that would rupture through the traditional approach\", to police misconduct.",
            "Reform hadn't worked, she said. It was time now to transform.",
            "So in early June a majority of city council members took a step that shook Minneapolis and drew national and international attention. They pledged to dismantle a policing system long accused of racism, and build something new - \"to end policing as we know it\".",
            "They then proposed an amendment to the city's charter to put on the November ballot. It called for replacing the police department with a new entity of community safety and violence prevention.",
            "The proposal was short on detail but council members said there would be a public engagement process to fill in the blanks.",
            "Instead, they faced public opposition, most vocally from North Minneapolis, a largely black neighbourhood, which saw a dramatic rise in gun crime and robberies after Floyd's death. Residents have become so alarmed they are suing the city.",
            "\"We have historically had victims of violence by police,\" said Cathy Spann, a community organiser, at a recent neighbourhood gathering. \"But we are under siege right now with gunfire every single night. The council has to bring in extra force to stop this from happening!\"",
            "The consensus at the backyard gathering was that the council's declaration had emboldened criminals and demoralised the police department. Whatever the case, dozens of officers have left the force, quitting or claiming medical leave.",
            "\"We want to reimagine community policing, desperately, to save the lives of our young black and brown men and women,\" said Jon Lundberg, whose house was hit by random gunfire last week. ",
            "\"But what we need now is to reinstitute some systems of control. Because right now it's off the hook, it's off the chain.\"",

            "\"Now is where we should be digging deeper and tackling those very important questions around why are we seeing an increase in gun violence and robberies and we shouldn't shy away from that,\" she says.",
            "\"That doesn't mean what we did on 7 June doesn't work. What that means is that we're in it and that we need to stay committed and dedicated to solving long-term problems that even our police officers can't solve.\"",
            "But those efforts have been set back by the city's charter commission, an appointed state body, which determined that the police amendment was too vague, and put off any vote for another year. ",
            "In the meantime the council has taken some steps. It diverted $1.1m from the police budget to newly formed community patrols. And Minneapolis has instituted some incremental reforms, such as banning police chokeholds.",
            "But Dave Bicking, a veteran activist against police violence, says the council's radical move has done more harm than good.",
            "\"The diversion of that pledge and the city charter amendment I think are steps that took away from the chance to make short-term changes to the behaviour of the police department that would have made a difference,\" he says, citing in particular investigation of and discipline for incidents of misconduct and excessive force.",
            "In South Minneapolis, another community caught in the line of fire is trying to make its own sense of the city's upheavals.",
            "Ade Alabi has banded together with others in the neighbourhood to try to preserve the diverse and distinctive character of the commercial district around the Third Precinct. In the face of enormous rebuilding costs, they are fighting to keep it in the hands of the community rather than lose it to a handful of corporate property developers.",
            "They too, talk about transformation, hoping to bring more minority business owners into their corner of the city, and create more cultural and social space. It's something that lawyer Daniel Kennedy, who's part of the collective, calls \"an opportunity that nobody wanted\".",
            "The battered police station sits abandoned on this block of destruction. One option being discussed is to hand it over to the community. ",

Flowers, candles and murals of Ms Taylor are centre stage in Jefferson Square Park - dubbed Injustice Square or \"Breewayy\" by many locals.

So far, that hasn't happened.",
            "The city of Louisville paid $12m (£8.6m) to Ms Taylor's family and agreed to police reforms to settle a wrongful death lawsuit.",
            "Only one of the police officers who took part in the deadly raid faced any charges linked to the botched raid. Brett Hankison was charged with endangering Ms Taylor's neighbours by firing into a next door apartment.",

            "The footage shows the officers’ view of a death already widely seen on a bystander’s mobile phone video, which set off tumultuous protests in Minneapolis that quickly spread around the world and sparked a national reckoning on race and policing.",
            "Floyd appears distraught from the moment officers ask him to step out of his vehicle near a south Minneapolis corner grocery, where he was suspected of passing a counterfeit $20 bill. When Floyd did not immediately display his hands, Lane pulled his gun, leading Floyd to say he had been shot before.",
            "Floyd’s hands are soon handcuffed behind his back, and he grows more anxious, telling the officers that he’s claustrophobic and pleading with them not to put him in the back of a squad car.",
            "In the struggle, Floyd loses a shoe. What appears to be Chauvin’s chest-mounted body camera winds up underneath the squad car, and Floyd eventually winds up on the pavement with the officers holding him down.",
            "Chauvin and Kueng each grip one of Floyd’s handcuffed hands to hold them in position behind his back, with Kueng’s knee appearing to press on Floyd’s bottom or just below. Lane is at Floyd’s feet.",
            "The officers sound clinical as the minutes tick by. “I think he’s passing out,” one officer says. “You guys all right, though?” someone asks. “Yeah – good so far,” says one. Another – apparently Lane – says: “My knee might be a little scratched, but I’ll survive.” Kueng reaches out with a free hand to pull a pebble from the police SUV’s tire tread and toss it to the street.",
            "Lane did not sound particularly worried the first time he asked Chauvin whether they should roll Floyd on his side and suggested that Floyd might be in delirium. People in the crowd can be heard expressing fear for Floyd’s condition, asking whether he had a pulse and was breathing.",
            "A couple of minutes later, Lane sounds a bit more concerned when he asks again about rolling Floyd onto his side. The officers go quiet but show no apparent urgency as Kueng checks for a pulse and says he cannot find one.",
            "Lane’s camera shows him following an unresponsive Floyd on a stretcher into an ambulance, where EMTs instructed him to perform CPR. The video shows Lane performing constant chest compressions by hand with no visible results.",
            "The ambulance parks a few blocks away from the store for several minutes while Lane and the EMTs work on Floyd, rather than heading straight to the hospital, even though they all know that Floyd is in full cardiac arrest, as indicated by dispatcher audio.",
            "Christine Hill, a spokeswoman for Hennepin County Medical Center, the hospital that provided the ambulance, said she could not talk specifically about Floyd’s treatment because of medical privacy restrictions. But she said it is not unusual for paramedics to load a patient into an ambulance and move to a more secure location as they provide life-saving care.",
            "A coalition of news organisations and attorneys for Lane and Kueng have said the court should allow the body-camera footage to be copied and published to provide a more complete picture of what happened when Floyd was taken into custody.",
            "The viewing of the video took place on the same day Floyd family attorney Ben Crump announced a lawsuit against the city and the police officers involved in Floyd’s death.",
            "The body camera videos and transcripts were filed in court last week by Lane’s attorney, Earl Gray, as part of a request to have Lane’s case dismissed. Gray said at the time that he wanted the videos to be made public, telling the Star Tribune that they would show the “whole picture”. Gray said the bystander video shows just the last piece of what happened and “is not fair”.",
            "Gray’s request highlighted portions of the body camera video that show Floyd “actively resisting and acting erratic” with officers. It also noted Floyd’s “request” to be put on the ground. Gray also argued that Lane did not have a clear view of what Chauvin was doing.",
            "Kueng’s attorney, Tom Plunkett, has also asked that the video be made public."

        "body": [
            "Fifteen jurors are chosen for the trial of former policeman Derek Chauvin charged in the killing of George Floyd.",
            "A jury has been seated in the US city of Minneapolis, Minnesota for the trial of a former police officer charged in George Floyd‘s death, with opening statements set for March 29 in a case that led to weeks of protests and soul-searching about racial justice.",
            "The final juror was chosen on Tuesday, wrapping up a process that took more than two weeks and was complicated by worldwide attention to Floyd’s death, even before the city of Minneapolis announced a $27m settlement to his family early in the process.",
            "Lawyers and the judge worked through more than 100 potential jurors, dismissing most because they acknowledged strong views about an encounter that was captured on bystander video.",
            "Community murals painted on the side of what was the Lake Street Kmart, which was destroyed in the wake of George Floyd’s death in Minneapolis, Minnesota, US [Leah Millis/Reuters]The panel now includes 15 jurors. Twelve will deliberate, with two alternates; Hennepin County Judge Peter Cahill has said he will excuse the extra juror when opening statements begin on Monday if the 14 others still are able to serve.",
            "Derek Chauvin is charged with second- and third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter in the May 25 death of Floyd. The Black man was declared dead after Chauvin, who is white, pressed his knee against his neck for about nine minutes while Floyd was handcuffed and pleading that he could not breathe.",
            "The widely seen video set off street protests in Minneapolis, some violent, that spread across the US and the world.",
            "The final juror chosen is a married accountant who said he initially formed a somewhat negative opinion of Chauvin, saying it seemed like the length of his restraint on Floyd was longer than necessary. But he said he would be able to put that aside and weigh the case based on the evidence.",
            "He said Floyd’s death sparked discussions about racism at work, and he decided to educate himself by reading a book about the subject. He said he has a healthy respect for police and views Black Lives Matter somewhat favourably. However, he said some of the frustrations boiled over and may have been a factor in violent unrest in Minneapolis.",
            "Defence lawyer Eric Nelson, left, and defendant former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin listening while Hennepin County Judge Peter Cahill presides over pre-trial motions, prior to continuing jury selection in Minneapolis, Minnesota [Court TV/Pool via AP]Several other potential jurors were dismissed earlier in the day, including a former truck driver who called a movement to defund the police “lunacy” and said he would likely believe police officers over citizens. Others dismissed included a woman who said she feared for her safety if chosen for the panel and a man who said he could not be impartial.",
            "The defence frequently struck people who told the court they already had strong feelings about Chauvin’s guilt. The prosecution frequently used its allotted challenges against potential jurors who were not just supportive of police but said they would favour their testimony over others. They also sought to block potential jurors who were critical or doubtful about the Black Lives Matter movement.",
            "With the jury seated, both sides now gear up for opening statements on Monday. Legal experts have said the bystander video – already seen by almost everyone on the jury – is compelling footage but that a conviction is not a slam-dunk for prosecutors.",
            "Of the first 14 jurors seated, eight are white, four are Black and two are multiracial, according to the court. Nine are women and five are men, and they range in age from their 20s to 60s. The race and age of the 15th juror were not immediately released by the court.",
            "Cahill on Friday had dismissed a defence request to delay or move the trial because the $27m civil settlement for Floyd’s family came on March 12, just as jury selection was getting under way.",
            "“Unfortunately, I think the pretrial publicity in this case will continue no matter how long we continue it. Perhaps some of it may, with time, be forgotten by people,” Cahill said.",
            "“And as far as change of venue, I do not think that that would give the defendant any kind of a fair trial beyond what we are doing here today.”"

        "title": "George Floyd, a survivor’s guilt and a global Black Lives Matter",
        "body": [
            "The Black Lives Matter struggle is no longer confined to the national borders of the United States.",
            "Wherever we live in the world, we, Black Americans, cannot escape the feeling of collective grief that has overwhelmed our community after George Floyd, a Black man, was murdered by a white police officer in Minneapolis.  ",
            "Watching the widely circulated video showing the last moments of Floyd’s life, I felt the devastating pain and anger at the never-ending injustice that Black Americans face in their own country. It was not so long ago that we marched in New York over the brutal death of Eric Garner at the hands of the police – another Black man who died pleading “I can’t breathe!” It was not long ago that protests were held for other Black victims of white supremacy – all clearly ignored by the system which supports and protects Black oppression.",
            "Sitting in my small apartment in Berlin, I also felt the survivor’s guilt – the guilt of knowing that I have escaped the gruesome reality of Black life in America, which was once again laid bare by the recent cascade of Black death – from the killing of Floyd to the killings of Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, Tony McDade, Rayshard Brooks and many others whose stories have not made it to mainstream media. ",
            "And then the streets of America erupted. Hundreds of thousands braved a pandemic and sadistic police brutality to declare that Black lives matter and enough is enough. Hundreds of thousands persisted in their protest, as the US president threatened “where there is looting, there is shooting” and officials called for the army to be deployed and martial law. ",
            "They resisted, as the media tried to distort their demonstrations and politicians and pundits conspired to shift the conversation towards piecemeal reforms. ",
            "Despite the repression, slander and obfuscation, the new iteration of the Black Lives Matter protests led by Black women, men and transgender and other queer people, persevered and stayed on course. ",
            "It was inspiring to watch from afar their political acuity and tenacity and their insistence on revolution, not reform.",
            "It was breath-taking to see their spectacular success at putting prison abolition and defunding the police on the current political agenda and drawing attention to divestment from oppressive policing to investment in communities to address housing precarity, economic inequality and health disparities. ",
            "It was galvanising to see issues of marginalisation within the Black community raised. Some 15,000 people marched in Brooklyn for the visibility of Black transgender lives and an end to violence against Black transgender people, declaring “We [transgender people] are not going to be left out.”",
            "My pain was mixed with elation and pride watching people articulate versions of freedom that I have believed in for years – a Black freedom struggle that does not leave anyone behind and that is grounded on full equality through revolutionary change, not symbolic reform. ",
            "Indeed, I so wished I was in the United States to take part in this historic moment, in this revolutionary movement. But return home for me is not an option. I am in debt exile – a consequence of the same economic oppression that leaves so many Black Americans destitute. ",
            "Apart from a student loan of $120,000, what keeps me away from the US is also the trauma of Black life. My family, too, has been affected by the American carceral state which preys on Black people. ",
            "In 2014, my brother – who suffers from schizophrenia – was incarcerated for more than eight months for trespassing on someone’s lawn and in 2019, he was shot and survived a gun wound. Some of my cousins are currently imprisoned in the state of Florida, awaiting their release, while being in solitary confinement to avoid contracting COVID-19. ",
            "Similar to James Baldwin, who fled suffocating racism and spent some pivotal years living in Europe during the civil rights movement, I feel guilty about living abroad during this moment where I am afforded the space to write, breathe, and be debt-free.",
            "But unlike Baldwin, I cannot return. After three years of setting up a home in Berlin, building a community with local activists and artists, and finding stability for the first time in my life, a return to the US would be a reckoning with the full gravity of being Black in America – it would be a return to the indebted and worried existence of physical and economic survival, and that is something I can no longer bear.",
            "But, we, Black American emigres, did not watch idle the revolutionary momentum that the George Floyd protests triggered.  ",
            "The anger, pain and despair that poured out in the streets of America were so powerful that they shook the whole world, inspiring solidarity protests in dozens of countries, which gave more ammunition to challenge police state violence and the legacies of colonialism. And we joined. ",
            "In France, Black Parisians reignited the struggle for justice for Adama Traore, a 24-year old Black Parisian who died in police custody. ",
            "In England, protesters attacked the statue of historic figures who played a leading role in British imperialism and the slave trade, starting a nationwide conversation about the whitewashing of British colonial history. ",
            "In Belgium, after mass protests forced the removal of several statues of King Leopold II, notorious for his barbaric rule of Congo; they also prompted the head of parliament to call for a truth and reconciliation commission to address colonial time crimes.",
            "In the Netherlands, demonstrations elicited calls for the use of blackface to portray “Black Pete” in Christmas celebrations to be banned.",
            "In Brazil, the last country in the Americas to officially abolish slavery, there have also been protests in support of Black Lives Matter. The country itself is still struggling with the anti-Black racist legacy of its colonial period and the brutal US-backed dictatorship during the Cold War period. There, too, Black people are the main victim of police brutality and systemic discrimination. ",
            "In Australia, protests have pushed to the fore public discussions about white settler colonialism and state violence against the Aboriginal people, which the white majority has long sought to suppress. In fact, the local authorities sought to ban protests in cities like Sidney, using the COVID-19 pandemic as an excuse. ",
            "In Germany, local protests which were held not just in Berlin, but in other large cities across the country, also sparked national conversations about racism. Many people, including white Americans I know, insist that racism is not as bad in Germany as it is in the US. But official statistics, as well as testimonies of brown and Black people, tell a different story. ",
            "These protests offered a much-needed space for me and other Black Americans to voice our pain publicly. I spent three weekends protesting with hundreds of people outside Brandenburg Gate, tens of thousands at Alexanderplatz, and several thousand in Hermannplatz, chanting, grieving, and decrying the ongoing assault on Black life in America and around the world. ",
            "Indeed, deep-rooted, debilitating, structural racism is an international problem. It is a transatlantic creation, forged and maintained by white people in both Europe and the Americas and it is heavily interlinked. White supremacy and neo-colonialism do not stop at national borders but rather form transnational systems of oppression that subjugate, exploit, and brutalise for the benefit of the white elite at the top.",
            "I, as a Black Haitian-American, have experienced racism both at home and abroad and I see these experiences in a continuum. And I have come to believe that the anti-racism struggle may take different forms in different places, but if we want honest and concrete ways to address the violent histories that we have inherited, then we have to engage in the fight against racism globally. ",
            "The renewed momentum of the Black Lives Matter movement sparked by the death of George Floyd has opened up spaces for this kind of global struggle against racialised violence, oppression and neocolonialism. And people like me, guilty survivors of racist oppression in the US, are able to find renewed meaning in our struggles. ",
            "“Once you find yourself in another civilisation,” Baldwin noted, “you’re forced to examine your own.” And it is from this distance, as a writer and an activist that I am honing in and participating in anti-racism activism here in Europe, the birthplace of white supremacy and colonialism.",
            "As a descendant of Africans who were enslaved and forcibly transported to the Americas, I am challenging racism on the very continent from where the enslavement and subjugation of my ancestors were organised, directed and justified. This gives me space and perspective to grapple with this complex centuries-old system of oppression from its roots all the way to its many modern-day manifestations both locally and internationally.

            "Governor Tim Walz said the deployment comes as part of an effort to help quell the protests, which have often started off peaceful before descending into chaos, with fires and looting – violence he largely blamed on outsiders.",
            "“We do not have the numbers,” Walz said. “We cannot arrest people when we are trying to hold ground.”",
            "Minnesota National Guard General Jon Jensen said all the state’s guardsmen had been activated, and some 2,500 members were expected to be mobilised by midday. “It means we’re all in,” Jensen said.",
            "It is the “largest domestic deployment in the Minnesota’s National Guard’s 164-year history,” the National Guard said on Twitter.",
            "The deployment comes more than four days after the killing of George Floyd, which has set off angry protests across the United States against police brutality and the treatment of African Americans. Friday saw demonstrations and marches, sometimes violent, in Minneapolis, Louisville, Kentucky, Atlanta, Georgia, Houston, Texas, Washington, DC, and elsewhere.",
            "Floyd died on Monday after Derek Chauvin, a white officer, pinned the Black man’s neck down to the ground with his knee for nearly nine minutes.",
            "A bystander video of the incident shows Floyd pleading for help, repeatedly saying: “I can’t breathe.”  Floyd eventually goes motionless, and Chauvin continues to kneel on Floyd’s neck for nearly three minutes despite appeals by bystanders to get off of him, according to court documents.",
            "The four officers involved, including Chauvin, were fired on Tuesday. Chauvin was arrested and charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter on Friday, more than three delays after the incident.",
            "",
            "Governor Walz said he expected Saturday’s protests in Minneapolis to be the most intense yet. Protesters have previously told Al Jazeera they plan to stay in the streets until at least all four officers have been arrested and charged, despite nightly curfews and the presence of the National Guard.",
            "“They would not need the [National Guard] if they would just listen to the people,” said Aman Mohamed, another Minneapolis resident.",
            "It’s uncertain what exactly it’s going to take for things to calm down, but Layla Ahmed, another resident, told Al Jazeera “having one person arrested is not enough. We need all four.”",
            "In a joint statement with the family of Floyd, Benjamin Crump, a prominent civil rights lawyer whose firm is representing their case, called the arrest of Chauvin “a welcome but overdue step on the road to justice”.",
            "Crump and the family also expressed disappointment with the charge itself. “We expected a first-degree murder charge,” they said. “We want a first-degree murder charge. And we want to see the other officers arrested.”",
            "The fact that the three other officers, identified as Thomas Lane, Tou Thao, and J Alexander Kueng, stood by while Chauvin pinned Floyd with his knee for almost nine minutes “demonstrates a breakdown in training and policy by the city” the statement said. “We fully expect to see the other officers who did nothing to protect the life of George Floyd to be arrested and charged soon.”",

            "In addition to more arrests, Crump and the family said it is essential that Minneapolis “closely examines and changes its policing policies and training procedures to correct for their lack of proper field supervision; the use of appropriate, non-lethal restraint techniques; the ability to recognise medical signs associated with the restriction of airflow, and the legal duty to seek emergency medical care and stop a civil rights violation.”",
            "Crump also said the family had hired an independent medical examiner to conduct their own autopsy, following the release by the preliminary autopsy report by the Hennepin County Medical Examiner’s office.",

            "Floyd likely died from “the combined effects of … being restrained by police, his underlying health conditions and any potential intoxicants in his system,” the report added.",
            "Responding to the report, Floyd’s family said: “We are not surprised, yet we are tragically disappointed in the preliminary autopsy findings released today by the medical examiner. We hope that this does not reflect efforts to create a false narrative for the reason George Floyd died.”",

The bad part, he thinks, is that kids have to see guardsmen walking around with guns. “They think this is a warzone.”",
            "Another longtime resident, Marvin Smith, who describes himself as a peaceful bystander that was at the Plymouth protests of 1966 in North Minneapolis, said the Guard “should have been here”, but that “you can’t tell people not to protest 400 years of injustice.”",
            "Smith said he “hopes it’s peaceful forever,” that it was unfair to compare brick and mortar buildings to “blood, sweat, and tears”. He said he believed there is still a long way to go before people of colour have the same opportunities and freedoms as white people. “The idea that this is going to go away when the rioting stops is asinine.”",

In between the news headlines that have thrust Minneapolis, Minnesota, into the United States national spotlight is a community that has come together to honour George Floyd by helping those in need.",

As anger exploded, some of the protests turned violent, with fires, looting and vandalism. Some local businesses were hit. Others were already under strain from coronavirus lockdowns that had been in place for months.",

Those proceedings are set to begin on March 8.",

            "In documents requesting dismissal, Lane’s lawyer, Earl Gray, wrote about Floyd’s prior charges of armed robbery and drug possession in Texas. He called Floyd an ex-con, a violent defendant, a liar, an addict, a drug distributor, and a danger. “Mr Floyd was, as the Officers had suspected, an addict,” Gray wrote. “He was worse than that.”",

            "Body-camera footage from the day Floyd died shows Lane and Kueng approaching a panicked Floyd, who says, “I’m not a bad guy!” and struggles, begging not to be put in a squad car. Gray wrote that the video shows Floyd had something in his mouth that looked like a fentanyl pill, which disappeared. Autopsy reports show Floyd had fentanyl in his system.",
            "Gray and Eric Nelson, Chauvin’s lawyer, wrote that during a May 2019 arrest, Floyd would not listen to officers’ commands, put something in his mouth, had to be physically removed from a vehicle, then began to cry. In that case, several opioid pills were found, along with cocaine, they wrote.",
            "Nelson compared Floyd’s behaviour in both arrests, saying: “Clearly, Mr Floyd had a modus operandi in the way he acted when approached by police officers while attempting to conceal narcotics.”",
            "Keegan said even if the officers had no knowledge of the 2019 arrest, defence lawyers could argue Floyd had a habit of swallowing drugs, acting scared, crying and struggling when approached by police.",
            "Gray wrote that Floyd shares blame for his death.",
            "“All he had to do is sit in the police car, like every other defendant who is initially arrested,” Gray wrote. “While attempting to avoid his arrest, all by himself, Mr Floyd overdosed on Fentanyl. Given his intoxication level, breathing would have been difficult at best. Mr Floyd’s intentional failure to obey commands, coupled with his overdosing, contributed to his own death.”",
            "Nelson also honed in on Floyd’s past drug use, writing that bringing up Floyd’s history of drug addiction is “not an attempt to assail Mr Floyd’s character”. But, he said, Floyd most likely died of “fentanyl or a combination of fentanyl and methamphetamine in concert with his underlying health conditions”.",
            "The county medical examiner classified Floyd’s death as a homicide, with his heart stopping while he was restrained by police and his neck compressed. A summary report listed fentanyl intoxication and recent methamphetamine use under “other significant conditions” but not under “cause of death”.",
            "According to prosecutors’ notes, Hennepin County Medical Examiner Andrew Baker told prosecutors that absent other apparent causes of death, it “could be acceptable” to rule the death an overdose, based on the level of fentanyl in Floyd’s system.",
            "A separate autopsy commissioned for Floyd’s family concluded he died of asphyxiation due to neck and back compression.",
            "Lewis and Keegan said Floyd’s cause of death will be up to a jury. They said it would be tough to eliminate all biases from a potential jury, and questions asked during jury selection will be important.",
            "While a blame-the-victim approach might seem questionable to some, Lewis said a defence lawyer’s job “is not to foster racial harmony or to further criminal justice reform. His job is solely to get his client acquitted.”"

        "body": [
            "The Trump administration has already arrested more than 300 protesters since the death of George Floyd.",
            "In a private call with federal prosecutors across the country, Attorney General William Barr’s message was clear: Aggressively go after demonstrators who cause violence.",
            "Barr pushed his US attorneys to bring federal charges whenever they could, keeping a grip on cases even if a defendant could be tried instead in state court, according to officials with knowledge of last week’s call who were not authorised to publicly discuss the matter and spoke on condition of anonymity. Federal convictions often result in longer prison sentences.",
            "The Trump administration’s crackdown has already led to more than 300 arrests on federal crimes in the protests since the death of George Floyd. An AP analysis of the data shows that while many people are accused of violent crimes such as arson for hurling Molotov cocktails and burning police cars and assault for injuring law enforcement, others are not. That has led to criticism that at least some arrests are a politically motivated effort to stymie demonstrations.",
            "“The speed at which this whole thing was moved from state court to federal court is stunning and unbelievable,” said Charles Sunwabe, who represents an Erie, Pennsylvania, man accused of lighting a fire at a coffee shop after a May 30 protest. “It’s an attempt to intimidate these demonstrators and to silence them,” he said.",
            "Some cases are viewed as trumped up and should not be in federal court, lawyers say, including a teenager accused of civil disorder for claiming online “we are not each other’s enemy, only enemy is 12”, a reference to law enforcement.",
            "The administration has seized on the demonstrations and an aggressive federal response to showcase what President Donald Trump says is his law-and-order prowess, claiming he is countering rising crime in cities run by Democrats. Trump has derided protesters and played up the violence around protests, though the majority of them are peaceful.",
            "Pockets of violence have indeed popped up in cities, including Portland, Oregon, where protests devolved into clashes with law enforcement for weeks on end. Nights of looting and other unrest have occurred elsewhere: Rochester, New York; Minneapolis, Louisville, Washington, DC, and Chicago.",
            "Federal officials were called to Kenosha, Wisconsin, after large protests and unrest following the shooting of Jacob Blake and the gunning down of two protesters and the later arrest of a 17-year-old in their deaths. Notably, that teenager has not been charged with any federal crimes. Neither was a man accused of shooting and killing a demonstrator in Louisville following the death of Breonna Taylor.",
            "While Barr has gone after protest-related violence targeted at law enforcement, he has argued there is seldom a reason to open sweeping investigations into the practices of police departments. The Justice Department, however, has initiated a number of civil rights investigations into individual cases. Barr has said he does not believe there is systemic racism in police departments, even though Black people are disproportionately more likely to be killed by police, and public attitudes over police reforms have shifted.",
            "During the call with US attorneys, Barr raised the prospect that prosecutors could bring a number of other potential charges in unrest cases, including the rarely used sedition statute, according to the officials familiar with the call. Legal experts cautioned the use of that statute is unlikely, given its difficulty to prove in court.",
            "Federal involvement in local cases is nothing new. Officials across the country have turned to the Justice Department for decades, particularly for violent crime and gang cases where offenders could face much stiffer federal penalties and there is no parole.",
            "Police chiefs in several cities have pointed to the importance of their relationships with federal prosecutors to bring charges that can result in long prison sentences to drive down violent crime.",
            "Even before the unrest earlier this year, the Justice Department was stepping in to bring charges in states where the government believes justice is not being fully pursued by local prosecutors. In January, for example, the department brought federal hate crime charges against a woman accused of slapping three Orthodox Jewish women in one of several apparently anti-Semitic attacks reported throughout New York during Hanukkah.",
            "It is not clear whether protest-related arrests will continue apace. Demonstrations have slowed, though not necessarily because of the federal charges. Wildfires in the West and hurricanes in the South have lessened some of the conflict.",
            "",
            "While many local prosecutors have dismissed dozens of low-level protest arrests, some are still coming down hard. A Pennsylvania judge set bail at $1m for about a dozen people in a protest that followed the death of a knife-wielding man by police.",
            "Even some Democrats, including District of Columbia Mayor Muriel Bowser, have called for the Justice Department to pursue federal charges against violent demonstrators, going as far as accusing the administration of declining to prosecute rioters. Washington’s Metropolitan Police Department had arrested 42 people one August weekend after a protest left a trail of vandalism. But prosecutors said the arrest paperwork did not identify specific crimes tied to each suspect.",
            "The federal confrontation with Bowser seemed counterintuitive, though Trump has a history of squaring off against the mayor.",
            "About one-third of the federal protest-related cases are in Portland, for crimes such as assaulting a deputy US marshal with a baseball bat, setting fires and setting off explosives at the federal court and throwing rocks at officers.",
            "Three purported “Boogaloo” members, who use the loose movement’s name as a slang term for a second civil war or collapse of civilization, were charged with possessing a homemade bomb and inciting a riot in Las Vegas.",
            "An El Paso, Texas, man was accused of promoting hate speech, posting a video online with a racist epithet and making threatening comments to Black Lives Matter protesters while holding a military-style rifle at his feet. A Minnesota man was accused of helping burn down a police precinct headquarters there after Floyd’s death.",
            "But other cases simply do not belong in federal court, lawyers say.",
            "In Seattle, 35-year-old Isaiah Willoughby, who is accused of setting fire to the outside of a police precinct, faces a mandatory minimum of five years in prison if convicted of arson in federal court. He could be looking at about a year behind bars in state court, where his lawyer said the case belongs.",
            "“This is city property that has been destroyed and you have a local prosecutors office that is ready and willing and able to charge these cases in state court, but the federal government is attempting to emphasize these protest-related crimes for whatever agenda they are seeking to pursue,” said assistant federal public defender Dennis Carroll.",
            "Carroll accused federal authorities of using the cases to try to make the protests seem more violent and disruptive than they really were.",
            "Federal prosecutors this month agreed to dismiss the charge against a man who authorities said was found with a Molotov cocktail in his backpack after he and other protesters were arrested in May for blocking traffic in Jacksonville, Florida. Video showed that 27-year-old Ivan Zecher was wrongfully arrested because he was actually on the sidewalk – not in the street – meaning prosecutors could not pursue their case, Zecher’s attorney, Marcus Barnett said.",
            "“There is absolutely an agenda here to blow these out of proportion, make these look more serious or more sinister than it is,” Barnett said of the pursuit of federal charges. “This is the Justice Department, from the top, furthering an agenda that has nothing to do with justice.”"

            "A medical examiner’s office on Monday ruled that the death of George Floyd, the Black man whose killing in Minneapolis, Minnesota, police custody last week triggered nationwide protests, was a homicide and that he died from asphyxiation.",
            "The medical examiner’s finding that the death was a homicide confirms the same conclusion of the independent autopsy that was also released on Monday, but there are key differences over the cause.",
            "A news release from the Hennepin County Medical Examiner said that Floyd, who struggled to breathe as an officer pinned him down by kneeling on his neck, had “recent methamphetamine use” and “fentanyl intoxication” – along with hypertension and coronary artery disease – all of which were possible contributing factors to his death.",
            "But two doctors who carried out that independent autopsy of Floyd, 46, and two lawyers for the family said that he had no underlying health conditions that may have contributed to his death. They argued that not only the officer who was kneeing Floyd’s neck killed him, but also two officers who were pressing their weight onto Floyd’s back while he was on the ground.",

Gray said Lane had asked twice if officers should roll Floyd on his side, and the senior officer – Derek Chauvin – said no.",

Lane, Kueng and Tou Thao are charged with aiding and abetting both second-degree murder and manslaughter.

            "Gray said in his court filing (PDF) that his client’s body camera video shows a complete view of how the encounter with Floyd went from the time Lane got on the scene to the point where Floyd was put into an ambulance; Lane went in the ambulance and helped with CPR.",
            "Gray said that from the start, Lane demanded to see Floyd’s hands at least 10 times while Floyd was in his car, and Lane told investigators he drew his gun because Floyd was reaching for something, but then holstered it once Floyd showed his hands. Gray said Floyd was acting erratically and had foam at his mouth.",

            "The former officers appeared in court for a hearing on the prosecution’s request to move the trial out of Minneapolis.",
            "Prosecutors in the case of four former Minneapolis officers charged in the death of George Floyd told a judge Friday that the men should face trial together because the evidence and charges against them are similar, and multiple trials could traumatise witnesses and Floyd’s family.",
            "But defence lawyers have argued for separate trials, saying they would likely offer “antagonistic” defences and the evidence against one officer could negatively affect another.",
            "The former officers appeared in court Friday for a hearing on the prosecution’s request to hold a joint trial, a defence request to move the trial out of Minneapolis, and other issues. Judge Peter Cahill took most issues under advisement, but granted a defence request to remove a local prosecutor from the case.",
            "Floyd, a Black man in handcuffs, died May 25 after Derek Chauvin pressed his knee against Floyd’s neck as Floyd said he could not breathe. Chauvin is charged with second-degree murder, third-degree murder and manslaughter. Thomas Lane, J Kueng and Tou Thao are charged with aiding and abetting second-degree murder and manslaughter.",
            "Chauvin, who is in custody, appeared in person for the first time, after attending previous hearings via videoconference. He did not make eye contact with any of the defendants as he arrived, but Kueng looked at him as he passed and Lane glanced over.",
            "Attorney General Keith Ellison, whose office has taken the lead on prosecution, was also in court.",
            "Cahill said Friday that four Hennepin County prosecutors including County Attorney Mike Freeman are disqualified from the trial because they met with the county medical examiner to discuss autopsy results. Cahill said they could be called as witnesses. Freeman has long been out of favour with local activists for the way his office has handled cases against police officers.",
            "Before the hearing, a few dozen protesters gathered in front of the court, chanting “No justice, no peace.” One carried a Black Lives Matter flag and wore a black helmet with swim goggles around the back of his head. By the time the hearing ended, a large, loud crowd had gathered outside. Some beat drums while others chanted anti-police slogans.",
            "Prosecutors said in court filings that the case should proceed with one trial because the evidence – including witness statements, body camera video and police department policy on the use of force – is similar for each officer.",
            "Neal Katyal, an outside special attorney assisting the prosecution, told Cahill on Friday that the “interests of justice” favour one trial because multiple trials would place a burden on the court and witnesses, and could delay justice for months, if not years.",
            "Katyal also said publicity about a verdict in a first trial could prejudice the jury pool for later trials. A joint trial “would allow the community to absorb the verdicts at once. … We don’t think they should be put through the trauma of four different jury verdicts,” he said.",
            "Defence lawyer Earl Gray, who represents Lane, and other lawyers argued briefly against trying the ex-officers together but relied mostly on written arguments. Gray said if trials were separate and Chauvin was tried first and acquitted, the others would essentially be cleared.",
            "Finger-pointing already prevailed in defence court filings. Lawyers for Lane and Kueng argued their clients were rookies who followed Chauvin’s lead. Thao’s lawyer, Bob Paule, said his client’s role was “absolutely distinct” from the others, because he was on crowd control while the others restrained Floyd.",
            "Chauvin’s lawyer, Eric Nelson, wrote that his client’s defence will be different, and the other men are already saying that if Chauvin committed a crime, they did not know about it or assist in it.",
            "“They blame Chauvin,” he wrote.",
            "But Chauvin pointed fingers, too. Nelson wrote that Lane and Kueng – the officers who responded to a forgery call – initiated contact with Floyd, and that Chauvin arrived and believed Floyd was overdosing on fentanyl. Nelson wrote that while Lane and Kueng called for a paramedic and believed Floyd was “on something,” they didn’t elevate the call to one of more urgency or give medical assistance. Nelson wrote that Chauvin could argue their inaction led to Floyd’s death.",
            "“If EMS had arrived just three minutes sooner, Mr. Floyd may have survived. If Kueng and Lane had chosen to de-escalate instead of struggle, Mr. Floyd may have survived. If Kueng and Lane had recognized the apparent signs of an opioid overdose and rendered aid, such as administering naloxone, Mr. Floyd may have survived,” Nelson wrote.",
            "Ben Crump, a lawyer for Floyd’s family members, said afterwards that the hearing was emotional.",
            "“They are trying to claim some asinine theory about an overdose. I want to be clear about this. The only overdose that killed George Floyd was an overdose of excessive force and racism by the Minnesota, Minneapolis, police department,” Crump said",
            "“Who are you going to believe, your eyes or these killer cops?” he said.",
            "Lawyers for all four men have also asked that the trial be moved from Minneapolis, saying pretrial publicity has made it impossible for them to receive a fair trial. Cahill deferred most of that discussion, but said he would like to send out questionnaires to potential Hennepin County jurors to find out whether they’ve seen the pretrial coverage or whether they have been affected by it.",
            "Paule, Thao’s lawyer, argued for moving the trial, noting the several nights of unrest in Minneapolis that followed Floyd’s death.",
            "The sides were split on whether the jury should be kept anonymous. Some lawyers said they have received angry calls from people who think their clients are guilty, and expressed fear that jurors would be subject to coercion if their names become public during the trial.",
            "Nelson said his client was “persona non grata number one in Minnesota” and expressed concern about pressure on the jurors if their names got out.",
            "“This incident has caused civil unrest not just nationally, but internationally,” he said."

            "Floyd’s death was widely condemned in Minnesota, with elected officials including Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey calling for the officers to be charged. Police Chief Medaria Arradondo said Floyd’s death was “murder”.",
            "Cahill asked Assistant Attorney General Matthew Frank to use his influence to keep public officials silent, warning that if they continued to discuss it publicly, he likely would “have to pull [trials] out of Hennepin County and they need to be aware of that.”",
            "Cahill set a March 8 trial date for the former officers if they are tried together, though he said he expected motions to be filed to separate their trials. The next court date is September 11.",
            "The defendants have not entered pleas. Chauvin’s lawyer has not commented publicly on the charges, while Lane’s and Kueng’s lawyers have sought to minimise their clients’ roles and deflect blame to the more senior Chauvin in Floyd’s death, which sparked protests around the world against police brutality.",

            "Cahill also rejected a defence request to reconsider his earlier decision to allow cameras in the courtroom during pretrial proceedings. Defence lawyers asked to allow such coverage, but prosecutors objected. The judge has not ruled on whether to allow cameras for the trial itself, in which Minnesota usually requires the consent of all parties.",
            "Kueng’s lawyer, Tom Plunkett, was the lawyer asking Cahill to reconsider his ruling on cameras. He asserted that prosecutors and other officials forfeited their right to object to cameras in the courtroom by making public comments that went as far as “saying the defendants are guilty of murder”. He said allowing electronic coverage of pretrial proceedings would actually make it easier to empanel a fair jury by helping to “educate the public that there may be more to the cases than what has been told to them by the state”.",
            "The charges against Chauvin are unintentional second-degree murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Second-degree murder carries a maximum penalty of 40 years in prison; third-degree murder carries up to 25 years and manslaughter up to 10.",
            "The other three former officers are charged with aiding and abetting both second-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Those charges are legally tantamount to the counts against Chauvin and carry the same penalties."

            "The reinstatement of a third-degree murder charge was a victory for state prosecutors, who had sought the additional lesser murder charge in part to afford them an extra path to a conviction should the jury find the evidence does not support the most serious charge. The third-degree murder charge carries a sentence of up to 25 years in prison.",
            "Hennepin County Judge Peter Cahill based his decision on an earlier killing by a Minneapolis police officer [Court TV/ Pool via AP]Legal experts say the additional charge helps prosecutors by giving jurors one more option to convict Chauvin of murder.",
            "The dispute over the third-degree murder charge revolved around the conviction of another former Minneapolis police officer in the unrelated killing of an Australian woman. The appeals court recently affirmed Mohamed Noor’s third-degree murder conviction in the 2017 shooting death of Justine Ruszczyk Damond, and the state used that affirmation to argue that it established a new justification for the charge in Chauvin’s case.",

Videos show Chauvin, who is white, kneeling on Floyd’s neck for nearly nine minutes on a sidewalk outside a grocery store as the Black man pleaded for his life and then stopped moving. Police were arresting him on suspicion of using a counterfeit $20 bill at the store. Floyd’s death outraged people around the world and helped fuel one of the largest protest movements ever seen in the United States, with daily demonstrations against racism and police brutality.",

We’ve seen people standing up and speaking up, and we’ve seen massive changes across the country,” he added. “But what we really wanted the world to see is the beauty of their child. The beauty of Gianna who is going to be taller than me soon, just like her dad. The beauty of Roxie who is holding up strong throughout this. And the actual situations in life that these things affect.”",

            "A judge in Minnesota on Tuesday lifted a gag order in the criminal case against four former officers charged in the death of George Floyd, but said he would take a news media coalition’s request to make body camera footage more widely available under advisement.",
            "Even though the gag order was vacated, Hennepin County District Judge Peter Cahill said he still expects all lawyers involved in the case to follow the rules on disclosure of information. In announcing his ruling, Cahill said he agreed with defence lawyers’ arguments that a gag order would be unfair to their clients and limit their ability to defend themselves against negative publicity.",
            "Cahill also ruled Tuesday that he would not hold the lead prosecutor in the case, Attorney General Keith Ellison, in contempt of court as two defence attorneys requested, saying a statement Ellison made when he announced that additional lawyers would be assisting the prosecution was innocuous and did not violate the gag order.",
            "Floyd, a Black man who was handcuffed, died May 25 after Derek Chauvin, a white police officer, pressed his knee against Floyd’s neck for nearly nine minutes as Floyd said he could not breathe. Chauvin is charged with second-degree murder, third-degree murder and manslaughter. Three other officers who were at the scene, Tou Thao, Thomas Lane and J Kueng, are charged with aiding and abetting both second-degree murder and manslaughter. All four officers were fired.",
            "",
            "Police body camera videos were filed with the court this month by Lane’s attorney, Earl Gray, as part of a request to have Lane’s case dismissed. Gray said he wanted the videos to be made public – prompting Cahill to issue an order barring attorneys and parties from discussing the case.",
            "Defence lawyers for all four of the former officers asked that the gag order be lifted.",
            "Cahill made the videos available for in-person, by-appointment viewing only. Media attorney Leita Walker objected to that format, saying it violated the common law, rules of public access to records and the United States Consitution’s First Amendment, and was essentially equivalent to keeping the videos under seal.",
            "Records of all courts are presumed to be open for public inspection with limited exceptions. Prosecutors said that a court may impose restrictions if that access will interfere with the fair and impartial administration of justice, and that reasonable alternatives are not adequate."

            "Minneapolis City Council members who tried unsuccessfully to dismantle the police department in response to George Floyd‘s death are set to vote Wednesday on whether to shrink it, a move that could imperil the entire city budget because the mayor is threatening to use his veto to protect public safety amid soaring crime rates.",
            "The plan, which supporters call “Safety for All”, is the latest version of the “defund the police” movement that Minneapolis and other United States cities have considered since Floyd’s May 25 death in police custody ignited mass demonstrations against police brutality and a nationwide reckoning with racism.",
            "Eleven of the 13 council members have already cast committee votes in favour of the largest parts of the plan, signalling that passage is likely. It would cut nearly $8m from Mayor Jacob Frey’s $179m policing budget and redirect it to mental health teams, violence prevention programmes and other initiatives.",
            "Protesters gather outside of the Hennepin County Family Justice Center while a court hearing on the case of the death of George Floyd proceeds inside, in Minneapolis, Minnesota, the US [File: Nicholas Pfosi/Reuters]“I am actively considering a veto due to the massive, permanent cut to officer capacity,” Frey said in a statement on Monday night. Reducing the authorised size of the force by 138 officers before enacting alternatives is “irresponsible”, he said.",
            "Cities around the US, including Los Angeles, New York City and Portland, Oregon, are shifting funds from police departments to social service programmes in an effort to provide new solutions for problems traditionally handled by police. Such cuts have led some departments to lay off officers, cancel recruiting classes or retreat from hiring goals.",
            "In Minneapolis, violent crime rates have surged since the death of Floyd, a Black man who was handcuffed and pleading for air for several minutes while Derek Chauvin, a white former officer, pressed his knee against his neck. Chauvin and three others were charged in Floyd’s death and are expected to stand trial in March.",
            "Protestors face off against police during a protest in Florissant, Missouri, the US [File: Lawrence Bryant/Reuters]“This summer happened because George Floyd was murdered by the Minneapolis Police Department and it wasn’t an accident; it’s because the system of policing we know now is not just racist, but it doesn’t create safety for all,” said Oluchi Omeoga, a cofounder of the Black Visions Collective, which supports “Safety for All” as a step toward more transformational change.",
            "Due to austerity forced by the coronavirus pandemic, the police department is already facing a $14m cut compared with its original 2020 budget.",
            "Mayor Frey aims to hold the number of sworn officers around 770 through 2021 with hopes of eventually increasing the force to its current authorised cap of 888. “Safety for All” would cap the number at 750 by 2022. The department is already down by about 120 officers – partly due to members of the police force claiming post-traumatic stress disorder from a summer of unrest – with more preparing to leave amid retirements and poor morale.",
            "Passions ran hot on both sides as more than 400 citizens signed up to speak during a marathon hearing last week that ran into the early hours Thursday, with many expressing alarm that the council was even contemplating cuts.",
            "“I think we need to make bold decisions on a path forward,” said Council Member Steve Fletcher, a co-author of the proposal. While acknowledging that it would mean fewer officers, he defended the plan by saying it would reduce the department’s workload by shifting 911 calls away from armed officers to other specialists such as mental health professionals.",
            "A memorial to George Floyd in Minneapolis, Minnesota, the US [Nicholas Pfosi/Reuters]On the other side are those like Frey and Police Chief Medaria Arradondo, who say there is no need for an either-or decision and that it is possible to reform policing without cutting officers. The mayor and 12 of the 13 council members are Democrats, while one council member is from the Green Party.",
            "If the council approves the plan on Wednesday, Frey would have five days to veto if he chooses. The council could override him with a two-thirds majority, or nine council members, but it’s not clear whether those nine votes exist. The proposal to cap the number of officers passed with just 7 of 13 votes in committee on Monday.",
            "A proposal over the summer to dismantle the department and replace it with a “Department of Community Safety and Violence Prevention” initially had support from a majority of the council, but faltered when a separate city commission voted against putting it on the November ballot. The city was paying $4,500 a day at one point for private security for three council members who reported getting threats after supporting defunding."

            "The courtroom has been adapted to mitigate the spread of the novel coronavirus, and Judge Peter Cahill has sharply limited attendance inside: the families of Chauvin and Floyd have each been allocated a single seat inside the courtroom, and most reporters attending must watch a video stream in a building across the street.",
            "Lawyers for Chauvin, who was fired from the police force the day after Floyd’s death, have argued that he correctly followed his training in helping colleagues arrest Floyd on suspicion of using a counterfeit $20 bill at the Cup Foods grocery store. A handcuffed Floyd can be seen in videos struggling against being placed in a police vehicle complaining he has claustrophobia.",
            "The medical examiner ruled that Floyd’s death was a homicide caused partly by police restraint holds. But the autopsy report also noted that Floyd had recently ingested the opioid fentanyl, and Chauvin’s lawyers contend that an overdose was the main cause of death."

            "Despite his concerns, Lane did not do anything to help Floyd or to reduce the force being used on him, the complaint said. Neither he nor Keung and Chauvin moved from their positions until an ambulance came and took Floyd to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead.",
            "Minneapolis police added a “duty to intervene” policy in 2016, saying officers are required to “either stop or attempt to stop another sworn employee when force is being inappropriately applied or is no longer required”.",
            "City officials moved on Friday to strengthen that duty by seeking to make it enforceable in court and to require officers to immediately report to their superiors when they see the use of any neck restraint or chokehold.",
            "Similar “duty to intervene” policies and initiatives had been in place for years in New York City, Miami and New Orleans. Since the Floyd case, Dallas and Charlotte, North Carolina, are among the places that have enacted similar policies. ",
            "But, Scott said, “There’s policy, and then there’s practice. More likely than not, practice and custom will prevail over policy.”",
            "Departments often do not reward officers for interfering with their colleagues or reporting that they broke policy, Scott said. And officers who do intervene risk being ostracised by their fellow officers and branded as informers.",
            "“In law enforcement, if you’re considered an individual who can’t be trusted, you’re not going to have the timely back-up from other officers,” Scott said. “That’s a legitimate fear factor.”",
            "Geoff Alpert, a criminology professor at the University of South Carolina, said when Lane questioned Chauvin at the time, he was undoubtedly “scared to death”.",
            "But ultimately, Alpert said, “he wasn’t courageous enough” to physically intervene to stop him.",
            "“He knew he would get hell from the 19-year veteran and all his buddies.”",
            "Lost in the furore over Floyd’s case and the national protests and debate over issues of racism and police brutality is the fact that two of the four officers involved in the arrest were minorities, hired as part of a Minneapolis police programme credited with helping to diversify the largely white force.",
            "Thao, a 34-year-old of Southeast Asian Hmong descent had been on the force for more than 10 years, and Kueng, a 26-year-old African American rookie who previously worked as a department store security guard, were both parts of the community service officer programme that brings in recruits to work part-time with the goal of making them regular members of the force.",
            "Chauvin, 44, is white, as is Lane, though he is an outlier of a different sort, a 37-year-old rookie who joined the police after working as a juvenile detention guard.",
            "Chuck Wexler, executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum, a Washington-based think-tank, said getting officers to take action, sometimes against more experienced colleagues, is at the heart of stopping abuses by police.",
            "“These new officers are put in a position where they’re told, ‘This is your mentor. He will teach you,'” he said. “A 20-year veteran is supposed to know what he is doing, and clearly he didn’t. He made every mistake possible.”"

The woman said she would be willing to change her mind if she saw evidence from a different perspective, but Nelson used one of his 15 peremptory challenges to dismiss her without providing a reason.",

            "The questioning illustrates the challenges facing attorneys in seating a jury after a video of Floyd’s arrest has been widely seen around the world.",
            "Cahill set aside three weeks for a process that could go even longer; opening statements are scheduled no sooner than March 29.",
            "Chauvin is charged with second-degree murder and manslaughter in Floyd’s death, and jury selection is proceeding despite uncertainty over whether a third-degree murder charge will be added. The state has asked the Minnesota Court of Appeals to stop proceedings until that is resolved, which could mean a delay of weeks or months.",
            "Floyd was declared dead on May 25 after Chauvin, who is white, pressed his knee against the Black man’s neck for about nine minutes, holding his position even after Floyd went limp. Floyd’s death sparked sometimes violent protests in Minneapolis and beyond, leading to a nationwide reckoning on race.",
            "Chauvin and three other officers were fired; the others face an August trial on aiding and abetting charges.",
            "Cahill ruled on several pretrial motions Tuesday, setting parameters for trial testimony. Among them, Cahill said jurors will hear when Chauvin stopped working for the police department, but they will not be told that he was fired or that the city made a “substantial offer” to settle a lawsuit from Floyd’s family. Those details will not be allowed because they could imply guilt, Cahill said.",
            "The city had no immediate comment when asked about the settlement offer. A message left with a lawyer for the Floyd family was not immediately returned.",
            "Cahill also ruled that a firefighter who can be heard in the bystander video, urging the officers to check Floyd’s pulse, will be allowed to testify about what she saw and whether she thought medical intervention was needed.",
            "But she will not be allowed to speculate that she could have saved Floyd if she had intervened. Testimony about what training Chauvin received will be allowed.",

            "Hundreds of people gathered outside the court as proceedings began Monday, many carrying signs that read, “Justice for George Floyd” and “Convict Killer Cops”. On Tuesday, there was little evident protest activity.",
            "The unintentional second-degree murder charge requires prosecutors to prove that Chauvin’s conduct was a “substantial causal factor” in Floyd’s death and that Chauvin was committing felony assault at the time. The third-degree murder charge would require them to prove that Chauvin caused Floyd’s death through a dangerous act without regard for human life.",
            "Manslaughter requires proof that Chauvin caused Floyd’s death through negligence that created an unreasonable risk, and consciously took the chance of causing severe injury or death."

            "Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA – The intersection where George Floyd was killed on May 25 has during the last week become a space for reflection, mourning and the honouring of the 46-year-old Black man, who died after a white officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes as he called out, “I can’t breathe.”",
            "Flowers, signs, cards, candles and a mural fill the pavement turned memorial at 38th Street and Chicago Avenue in Minneapolis, Minnesota.",
            "In many ways, the atmosphere at the site on Wednesday felt the same as all the other days. Music filled the air. A few people danced. Small children played. But the heaviness that has been hanging around the intersection for the past week felt a bit thicker on Wednesday than it had felt before.",
            "More than 1,000 people stood mostly silent as Floyd’s son, Quincy Mason, visited the site.",
            "“No man or woman should be without their father,” Quincy Mason told the crowd.",
            "Benjamin Crump, the prominent civil rights lawyer who is representing the family, stood by Quincy Mason’s side, urging the arrests of all four officers involved in Floyd’s death before Thursday, when the city is set to hold a public memorial.",
            "“Not one minute, not two minutes, not three minutes,” Crump shouted out, referencing the time Floyd’s neck was pinned to the ground. By the time he reached “almost nine minutes,” the crowd chanted along with him. “Eight minutes and 46 seconds George Floyd begged for air.”",
            "“We cannot have two justice systems in America – one of Black America and one for white America,” Crump said.",
            "“Change is going to come in the tragic killing of George Floyd,” he added. “That change starts today.”",
            "Moments after Crump and Mason left the area, someone in the crowd yelled, “They got all four!”",

            "Following the news, the heaviness of the day turned noticeably lighter, a collective sigh of relief from the crowd.",
            "“I feel very very happy that they decided to charge them,” said Williametta Jallah, who used to live in the neighbourhood.",
            "“Justice should prevail,” she said, as cheers rung out.",
            "“I got really excited because, honestly, we never do get justice out here,” Tati Ampah said. “For me, as long as they do get jail time, and as long as they do like understand that they did something wrong and that one of them could have jumped in and stopped a man from dying.”",
            "Chauvin, who has been in custody since Friday, had his third-degree murder charge increased to second-degree. He is also charged with second-degree manslaughter. ",

            "As initial news settled in, many at the memorial on Wednesday said the upgrade to the murder charge was not enough.",
            "“Am I happy? No” said Tiffany, who flew out to Minneapolis from New York City on Monday. She acknowledged that “progress” was being made, but said Chauvin should have been charged with first-degree murder instead. It was a call made by Floyd’s family, as well.",
            "In announcing the new charges on Wednesday, Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison noted that “you have to have to have premeditation and deliberation to charge first-degree murder”.",
            "He added that “history shows that there are clear challenges here” in prosecuting police officers.",
            "The second-degree murder charge carries a maximum 40-year sentence.",
            "“I strongly believe that these developments are in the interest of justice for Mr Floyd, his family, our community and our state,” Ellison said.",
            "Others at the memorial site were sceptical that the charges would result in convictions.",

        "body": [
            "Barr rejects Democrats’ assertions of racism in US policing and denies he favoured Trump’s friends in Mueller trials.",
            "United States Attorney General William Barr appeared before the House Judiciary Committee on July 28 for the first time since taking office in February 2019.",
            "Barr’s appearance came amid the deployment of federal law enforcement officers against crowds of protesters in Portland, Washington, DC, and other American cities.",
            "Barr’s tenure as the top law enforcement official in the US has been controversial. Some Democratic politicians have called for Barr’s impeachment. More than a thousand former Justice Department lawyers have signed a letter urging him to step down. Four former presidents of the DC Bar Association have called for a professional ethics probe.",
            "In the hearing, Democrats, who control a majority in the US House of Representatives, challenged Barr on a wide range of issues including whether he believes there is systemic racism in the US and whether he has favoured the president’s friends in prosecutions stemming from the Mueller probe.",
            "Here are key excerpts of what Barr said during the five-hour hearing:",
            "“Police forces today are far more diverse than they’ve ever been. And there are both more Black police chiefs and more Black officers in the ranks. Although the death of George Floyd at the hands of the police was a shocking event, the fact is that these events are, fortunately, quite rare.”",
            "“As one prominent Black professional in Washington said to me, African Americans will often feel treated as suspects first and citizens second, and I think these concerns are legitimate. At the same time, it would be an oversimplification to treat the problem is rooted in some deep-seated racism generally infecting our police departments. It seems far more likely that the problem stems from a complex mix of factors which can be addressed with focused attention over time.”",
            "“Unfortunately, some have chosen to respond to George Floyd’s death in a far less productive way by demonising the police, promoting slogans like ‘all cops are bastards’ and making grossly irresponsible programme proposals to defund the police. The demonisation of the police is not only unfair and inconsistent with principles of all people should be treated as individuals, but gravely injurious to the inner-city communities. When communities turn on and pillory the police, officers naturally become more risk-averse and crime rates soar. So, unfortunately, we are seeing that now in many of our cities, the threat to Black lives posed by crime on the streets is massively greater than any threat posed by police misconduct.”",
            "“In the wake of George Floyd’s death, violent rioters and anarchists have hijacked legitimate protests to wreak senseless havoc and destruction on innocent victims. The current situation in Portland is a telling example. Every night for the past two months, a mob of hundreds of rioters have laid siege to the federal courthouse and other nearby federal property. The rioters have come equipped for a fight, armed with powerful slingshots, tasers, sledgehammers, saws, knives, rifles and explosive devices. Inside the courthouse are a relatively small number of federal law enforcement personnel, charged with the defensive mission to protect the courthouse. What unfolds nightly around the courthouse cannot reasonably be called protest. It is, by any objective measure, an assault on the government of the United States.”",
            "“However, in the intervening time, we saw violent crime continuing to rise and a lot of that was triggered by the events after the death of George Floyd. So we did reboot the programme after COVID started breaking and we could commit the law enforcement resources to actually accomplish the mission, which is to reduce violent crime. Now, I regret that COVID interrupted our law enforcement activities, but it doesn’t obviate the fact that there is serious violent crime in these cities. These police departments and mayors have been asking us for help and we have put in additional federal agents and investigators to help deal with it.”",
            "“I’m a member of the cabinet. And there’s an election going on, obviously, the topic comes up in cabinet meetings and other things. It shouldn’t be a surprise that topic of the election was discussed.",
            "“I’m not going to get into my discussions with the president, but I’ve made it clear that I would like to pick the cities based on law enforcement need and based on neutral criteria.”",
            "“Stone was prosecuted under me. And I said all along, I thought that was a righteous prosecution. I thought he should go to jail. And I thought the judge’s sentence was correct. But the line prosecutors were trying to advocate for a sentence that was more than twice anyone else in a similar position had ever served and this is a 67-year-old man, first time offender, no violence, and they were trying to put him in jail for seven to nine years. And I wasn’t going to advocate that, because that is not the rule of law. I agree the president’s friends don’t deserve special breaks but they also don’t deserve to be treated more harshly than other people.”",
            "“Well, I would just say I asked another US Attorney in St Louis, who had 10 years in the FBI and 10 years in the Department of Justice as a career prosecutor, to take a look at it. And he determined based on documents that had not been provided to the Flynn side and not been provided to the court, that in fact, there was no basis to investigate Flynn. And furthermore, it was clearly established by the documents that the FBI agents who interviewed him did not believe that they thought he was lying.”",
            "“What the counsel concluded was that the only purpose of the interview – the only purpose – was to try to catch him in saying something that they could then say was a lie. So then, therefore, the interview was untethered to any legitimate investigation.”",
            "“There was unprecedented rioting right around the White House, very violent. During that time … we had around 90 officers injured. I’m talking about things like concussions, one was operated on and so forth … It was so bad that – as it’s been reported – the Secret Service recommended the president go down to the shelter. We had a breach of the Treasury Department. The historical building on Lafayette Park was burned down. St John’s was set on fire. Bricks were thrown at the police repeatedly. They took crowbars and pried up the pavers at Lafayette Park and threw those at the police. Balloons of caustic liquids were thrown on the police. And it was clear when I arrived at the White House on Monday, there was total consensus that we couldn’t allow that to happen so close to the White House, that kind of rioting. And therefore we had to move the perimeter out one block and push it up toward I Street. And there was already a plan in being at that point that the Park Police and the Secret Service had worked out the night before, which was to put the perimeter further away and then give them time to put a non-scaleable fence across the northern part of the park.”",
            "“During the day, the factors that led to the timing of it was that movement was going to be made as soon as there were enough units in place to actually perform it and units were very slow in getting into place throughout the day, much to my frustration, because I wanted to move before there was a big buildup of demonstrators, and also the fencing had to be delivered. And when those things were accomplished the tactical commander in charge of the Park Police proceeded with the movement of pushing the perimeter. So this was something conceived long before and didn’t turn on the nature of the crowd, although I would say the crowd was very unruly. And while the tactical considerations were made by the Park Police, they tried to respond to the situation.”",
            "“To say that this had to do with the photo op, I don’t mean to analogise this to a military operation, but it’s akin to saying that we invaded the Philippines in World War II so Douglas MacArthur could walk through the surf on the beach, one follows the other but we did not invade the Philippines so that MacArthur could walk to the beach.”"

        "title": "US AG Barr on racism, George Floyd, crime, Portland and Trump",
        "body": [
            "Barr rejects Democrats’ assertions of racism in US policing and denies he favoured Trump’s friends in Mueller trials.",
            "United States Attorney General William Barr appeared before the House Judiciary Committee on July 28 for the first time since taking office in February 2019.",
            "Barr’s appearance came amid the deployment of federal law enforcement officers against crowds of protesters in Portland, Washington, DC, and other American cities.",
            "Barr’s tenure as the top law enforcement official in the US has been controversial. Some Democratic politicians have called for Barr’s impeachment. More than a thousand former Justice Department lawyers have signed a letter urging him to step down. Four former presidents of the DC Bar Association have called for a professional ethics probe.",
            "In the hearing, Democrats, who control a majority in the US House of Representatives, challenged Barr on a wide range of issues including whether he believes there is systemic racism in the US and whether he has favoured the president’s friends in prosecutions stemming from the Mueller probe.",
            "Here are key excerpts of what Barr said during the five-hour hearing:",
            "“Police forces today are far more diverse than they’ve ever been. And there are both more Black police chiefs and more Black officers in the ranks. Although the death of George Floyd at the hands of the police was a shocking event, the fact is that these events are, fortunately, quite rare.”",
            "“As one prominent Black professional in Washington said to me, African Americans will often feel treated as suspects first and citizens second, and I think these concerns are legitimate. At the same time, it would be an oversimplification to treat the problem is rooted in some deep-seated racism generally infecting our police departments. It seems far more likely that the problem stems from a complex mix of factors which can be addressed with focused attention over time.”",
            "“Unfortunately, some have chosen to respond to George Floyd’s death in a far less productive way by demonising the police, promoting slogans like ‘all cops are bastards’ and making grossly irresponsible programme proposals to defund the police. The demonisation of the police is not only unfair and inconsistent with principles of all people should be treated as individuals, but gravely injurious to the inner-city communities. When communities turn on and pillory the police, officers naturally become more risk-averse and crime rates soar. So, unfortunately, we are seeing that now in many of our cities, the threat to Black lives posed by crime on the streets is massively greater than any threat posed by police misconduct.”",
            "“In the wake of George Floyd’s death, violent rioters and anarchists have hijacked legitimate protests to wreak senseless havoc and destruction on innocent victims. The current situation in Portland is a telling example. Every night for the past two months, a mob of hundreds of rioters have laid siege to the federal courthouse and other nearby federal property. The rioters have come equipped for a fight, armed with powerful slingshots, tasers, sledgehammers, saws, knives, rifles and explosive devices. Inside the courthouse are a relatively small number of federal law enforcement personnel, charged with the defensive mission to protect the courthouse. What unfolds nightly around the courthouse cannot reasonably be called protest. It is, by any objective measure, an assault on the government of the United States.”",
            "“However, in the intervening time, we saw violent crime continuing to rise and a lot of that was triggered by the events after the death of George Floyd. So we did reboot the programme after COVID started breaking and we could commit the law enforcement resources to actually accomplish the mission, which is to reduce violent crime. Now, I regret that COVID interrupted our law enforcement activities, but it doesn’t obviate the fact that there is serious violent crime in these cities. These police departments and mayors have been asking us for help and we have put in additional federal agents and investigators to help deal with it.”",
            "“I’m a member of the cabinet. And there’s an election going on, obviously, the topic comes up in cabinet meetings and other things. It shouldn’t be a surprise that topic of the election was discussed.",
            "“I’m not going to get into my discussions with the president, but I’ve made it clear that I would like to pick the cities based on law enforcement need and based on neutral criteria.”",
            "“Stone was prosecuted under me. And I said all along, I thought that was a righteous prosecution. I thought he should go to jail. And I thought the judge’s sentence was correct. But the line prosecutors were trying to advocate for a sentence that was more than twice anyone else in a similar position had ever served and this is a 67-year-old man, first time offender, no violence, and they were trying to put him in jail for seven to nine years. And I wasn’t going to advocate that, because that is not the rule of law. I agree the president’s friends don’t deserve special breaks but they also don’t deserve to be treated more harshly than other people.”",
            "“Well, I would just say I asked another US Attorney in St Louis, who had 10 years in the FBI and 10 years in the Department of Justice as a career prosecutor, to take a look at it. And he determined based on documents that had not been provided to the Flynn side and not been provided to the court, that in fact, there was no basis to investigate Flynn. And furthermore, it was clearly established by the documents that the FBI agents who interviewed him did not believe that they thought he was lying.”",
            "“What the counsel concluded was that the only purpose of the interview – the only purpose – was to try to catch him in saying something that they could then say was a lie. So then, therefore, the interview was untethered to any legitimate investigation.”",
            "“There was unprecedented rioting right around the White House, very violent. During that time … we had around 90 officers injured. I’m talking about things like concussions, one was operated on and so forth … It was so bad that – as it’s been reported – the Secret Service recommended the president go down to the shelter. We had a breach of the Treasury Department. The historical building on Lafayette Park was burned down. St John’s was set on fire. Bricks were thrown at the police repeatedly. They took crowbars and pried up the pavers at Lafayette Park and threw those at the police. Balloons of caustic liquids were thrown on the police. And it was clear when I arrived at the White House on Monday, there was total consensus that we couldn’t allow that to happen so close to the White House, that kind of rioting. And therefore we had to move the perimeter out one block and push it up toward I Street. And there was already a plan in being at that point that the Park Police and the Secret Service had worked out the night before, which was to put the perimeter further away and then give them time to put a non-scaleable fence across the northern part of the park.”",
            "“During the day, the factors that led to the timing of it was that movement was going to be made as soon as there were enough units in place to actually perform it and units were very slow in getting into place throughout the day, much to my frustration, because I wanted to move before there was a big buildup of demonstrators, and also the fencing had to be delivered. And when those things were accomplished the tactical commander in charge of the Park Police proceeded with the movement of pushing the perimeter. So this was something conceived long before and didn’t turn on the nature of the crowd, although I would say the crowd was very unruly. And while the tactical considerations were made by the Park Police, they tried to respond to the situation.”",
            "“To say that this had to do with the photo op, I don’t mean to analogise this to a military operation, but it’s akin to saying that we invaded the Philippines in World War II so Douglas MacArthur could walk through the surf on the beach, one follows the other but we did not invade the Philippines so that MacArthur could walk to the beach.”"

The officer, who has since been fired and charged for murder, knelt on Floyd’s neck for nearly nine minutes, as Floyd pleaded “I can’t breathe”.",
            "Since then, tens of thousands of people across the United States and abroad have taken to the streets demanding justice for Floyd and an end to systemic racism. Some of the largest US demonstrations, with more than 10,000 people, occurred in the nation’s capital, Washington, DC. There, protesters waved placards with the words “No justice! No peace!”, “I can’t breathe” and “Black lives matter”.",

This is very different from proving cause and effect – especially given the multitude of factors that contribute to the spread of the virus.",

Furthermore, she notes, “being outdoors certainly reduces the risk of transmission, by 20- to 500-fold according to some estimates.” ",
            "One of the stealthiest characteristics of the coronavirus is that it can be spread with little to no symptoms. This means that the number of people who are actually infected is probably much higher than the number of official confirmed cases.",
            "Elaborating further, Lesosky said, “in contrast, the crowding that often happens during mass marches, and especially the responses by the police including the use of tear gas, pepper spray [respiratory irritants] and the arrest and incarceration of large numbers of people are very likely to increase transmission.”",
            "Across the world, health officials will be closely monitoring the figures where large protests have taken place.  ",
            "In many countries, authorities have banned demonstrations due to health concerns, but protesters showed up nonetheless. "

        "title": "Minneapolis promised change after George Floyd. Instead it's geared up for war",
        "body": [
            "The George Floyd uprising that began in Minneapolis introduced the demand of defunding the police to the general public, empowered Black-led anti-police violence movements across the planet, generated policy changes in cities across the US, and most importantly built new organizations which have the capacity to fight for systemic change for the long haul. The uprising brought a lot of reforms and positive developments to its birth city, too, including a move to actually defund the Minneapolis police department and redistribute funds to services with a larger potential for eradicating both crime and poverty. Now, however, the Minneapolis and Minnesota governments are in the process of undoing that progress and moving in the opposite direction. The trial of Derek Chauvin, the officer who publicly killed 46-year-old George Floyd – and inadvertently triggered what may have been the largest protest movement in US history – began this week. Instead of becoming more transparent and committed to undoing the anti-Black image it has cultivated, the city of Minneapolis has quickly transformed itself into a 21st-century police state, pushing even beyond the hyper-militarization and violence that already plague police departments across the US.",
            "For a while it seemed that Minneapolis was headed on a better path. A veto-proof majority of city council members previously promised to dismantle the police department and build something better to replace it. Their attempts were dashed by the Minneapolis Charter Commission that shut down a ballot initiative that would have given voters the chance to abolish the police department in favor of a proposed department of community safety and violence prevention. By this winter, the summer’s ambitions had been replaced by a renewed commitment to the status quo. The police budget was cut by a mere $8m – out of a total budget of $179m – and a proposal to modestly reduce the size of the police force was shot down by city council members and Mayor Jacob Frey, who would be more useful to the world as a Justin Trudeau impersonator than an elected official. While the cut is a step towards disinvesting in police, it pales in comparison to the city council’s more genuinely radical rhetoric.",
            "",
            "Some of the blame for this policy about-face lies with the city’s rising violent crime rate and the subsequent push by some within Minneapolis for increased policing. This uptick in crime has been seen across the country and may add fuel to fiery opposition to police abolition activism. In fact, adding more police is hardly ever the real solution to increased crime rates, though it is often the first that cities reach for. There is no conclusive evidence that the overpolicing of the 1990s and the rise of mass incarceration is what caused the decline in crime that occurred towards the end of that decade. A growing number of sociologists and other social scientists believe that there is a abundance of historical evidence that shows that violent crime, particularly murder, is deeply correlated with political instability and a lack of faith in government institutions. Considering the pandemic and decades of unresolved social crises like police violence against Black people (only one Minnesota police officer has been convicted for on-duty killing in recent history), it shouldn’t surprise us that public trust in government is near historic lows. Increasing police presence, especially in moments of justified tension, will only continue this trend.",
            "That seems like the direction that the state of Minnesota, and Minneapolis more specifically, is headed as they prepare for protests in response to a potential acquittal of yet another police officer caught executing someone on camera. Governor Tim Walz has issued an order authorizing national guard troops to be sent into Minneapolis at the request of Frey. The governor has also proposed $35m in state aid to fund the deployment of police officers from across the state to support the Minneapolis police department in the case of “extraordinary public safety events”. The state is also coordinating with the FBI, the federal joint terrorism taskforce, and the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.",
            "The Hennepin county government center, the location of the trial, is being turned into a fortress. Several layers of high-security barbed-wire fences line the area around the center and a few buildings around it; they are reinforced with large concrete barriers which, combined with up to 2,000 national guard soldiers, give the impression that the city is ready to fight its own people. Speaking to ABC News, Kandace Montgomery, the current co-director of the local Black liberation organization Black Visions, responded to the city’s preparations:",
            "“As the people of Minneapolis and Minnesota are calling for justice and healing, and care, state officials have been responding in some ways by basically preparing to go to war with folks … So, I do think it’s meant to be an intimidation tactic.”",
            "In arguably its most dystopian move, the city also wanted to pay social media influencers to share messages during the trial to prevent potential rioting. The city planned on giving six influencers $2,000 a day each to combat “misinformation”. In January the city approved over a million dollars to fund a communication strategy that would include community organizations and influencers, specifically targeting “Black, Somali/East African, Native American, Hmong and Hispanic” communities by sharing “city-generated and approved messages” – which local activists have compared to the Ghetto Informant Program that Cointelpro used to hinder Black movements in the 1960s. After anger from community members, the influencer plan has been scrapped, though the city still plans on communicating with local leaders – excluding organizations like Black Visions who helped popularize the “defund the police” demand.",
            "People in Minneapolis are preparing for the trial in their own ways. Some organizers have already planned protests, while others are rebuilding mutual aid networks to support each other with grocery runs and resources in case of unrest. The Corcoran Neighborhood Organization is encouraging text chains among neighbors and has initiated neighborhood patrols. Frey insists that these preparations are unnecessary, but there is a strong lack of faith in the city’s ability to keep people safe, from police, and white supremacists, who have occasionally used moments of upheaval to attack protesters, like the 2015 shooting of five Minneapolis activists by white supremacists during protests over the police killing of Jamar Clark. The city’s plans thus far seem to be more concerned about what have statistically been peaceful protests than with the very real threat of white supremacist violence.",
            "Instead of committing to police reform and transparency – or acknowledging the growing threat of the far right – the city of Minneapolis is, in the words of city councilman Jeremiah Ellison, “showing up ready for war”.",

        "body": [
            "Andrea Jenkins lives just a few blocks away from 38th and Chicago, the crossroads in Minneapolis where George Floyd was killed on 25 May last year. She spent two decades of her life working to revitalise the community there, and kicked off her 2017 campaign for the city council’s Eighth ward in an arts centre a few yards away.",
            "After Floyd’s death, when the crossroads became a space for collective mourning, Jenkins visited every day. But in the midst of a bitter Minneapolis winter and with the neighbourhood reeling from the long-term effects of Floyd’s death, Jenkins hasn’t been in months.",
            "",
            "“It breaks my heart,” she says. “I knew every single business owner up there by name. Many of them are struggling – the few who are still there.” After years of economic upswing and community growth, Floyd’s death changed everything. “ When I walk through there, especially in winter time, it’s cold, people are shivering, there’s fire burning out of garbage cans. It looks like a scene out of Mad Max.”",
            "These are the consequences of fatal police violence in countless societies around the US, where the ramifications can extend beyond personal grief and trauma, and deep into the fabric of local community relations. But in the case of George Floyd, the repercussions spread so much wider – throughout the world – igniting a global discussion on race and racism.",
            "Jenkins, the first Black, openly transgender woman elected to public office in the US, became one of the most forceful voices to emanate from Minneapolis. She is not only a politician but also a poet, oral historian and an activist. She sang gospel in front of the nation’s media at a press conference in the days after Floyd’s death and played a central role in re-examining how the city’s long-criticised police force was funded. She insisted that racism be treated as a national public health emergency. And this month, with the murder trial of former officer Derek Chauvin, she is trying to prepare the city for the potential fallout.",
            "“It’s going to be traumatic,” she says of the trial, as we talk over Zoom. “We want to have as peaceful a situation as we can, and really have resources there for people to turn to if there are challenges.” She is in regular contact with members of Floyd’s family, who are equally worried. “But they’re really more concerned about justice,” she says. “They want to see justice and they want to make sure that George Floyd’s name is honoured for the role that his legacy plays in social justice.”",
            "Jenkins first saw the eyewitness video of Floyd’s death a few hours after the incident, at around 1am the following morning. She recalls it with vivid indignation. “The first thing was the callousness. The sort of relaxed cockiness. The sunglasses on the top of his [Chauvin’s] head. Hands in his pockets. You know, it just reeked of racism,” she says. “Literally he knew he was being filmed … and he just didn’t stop. To me that goes beyond police brutality. It enters into the realm of just pure, unadulterated racism. And that, unfortunately, is at the core of our society.",
            "“We can’t fight what we don’t name. We can’t cure what we don’t name. And so my whole point in declaring racism as a public health crisis is because racism is killing Black people.”",
            "Jenkins grew up on the West Side of Chicago, in neighbourhoods she describes as “hard-working and low-income”. Her father battled heroin addiction and spent much of her childhood incarcerated. She was raised mostly by her mother, who worked as an office administrator and brought up her two children, as well as two of Jenkins’s cousins, in a “pretty authoritarian” but “very loving” manner, emphasising the need for a good education.",
            "She discovered literature and poetry at a young age. In first grade, her class was visited by Gwendolyn Brooks, the Pulitzer prize-winning poet laureate of Illinois. “I just remember her saying ‘everyone can be a poet’,” she recalls. At the age of 14, Jenkins was taught by the poet Haki Madhubuti, one of the founders of Third World Press, now the largest independent Black-owned publisher in the US. “That’s when I really got indoctrinated into Black history, Black culture, the 1960s Black arts movement. Haki was really a believer that you must use poetry for social justice, and all Black artists should be using their art to uplift the race.” She roots around for an old volume of poetry in a large bookcase behind her and sweeps her braided hair to one side. She reads me one of her favourite poems from that time, I Wonta Thank Ya, by the Black poet Tejumola Ologboni. She looks up, occasionally, with piercing eyes. ",
            "She began writing in her mid-teens, and has contributed to and authored a number of acclaimed volumes of poetry, often dealing with intersectional issues of race, social justice, gender and sexuality. But at the beginning, her own gender was never a subject. “I was thinking about it,” she says, “but I would never, at that point in life, express my inner gender identity thoughts in a poem.”",
            "At 18, Jenkins moved to Minneapolis for university, and lived in male dorms. “In many ways a lot of my life was really trying to hide from what I knew to be true inside myself. I played football in high school. I joined a fraternity. Even younger, I was in the boy scouts. Because, you know, I didn’t want to be a girl. I knew I was a girl, but I didn’t want people to reject me.”",
            "In the early 1980s, Prince and other now high-profile musicians, such as Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, were making their names in Minneapolis. But when Jenkins arrived on campus, which was overwhelmingly populated by white students, it was a culture shock, from the racial stereotyping she experienced (false assumptions she had come to university on an athletic scholarship) to the stark differences in resources.",
            "But it was the fraternity that left the most traumatic memories. “I was outed by one of my fraternity brothers,” she says, volunteering the story slowly and carefully. “We were roommates, and he came home from work early one day sick, and I was in the apartment having sex with another man.” The roommate told the rest of Jenkins’s fraternity, who expelled her from the house, forcing her to return to Chicago “because I didn’t have a place to stay”.",
            "“I had to tell my mom, like: ‘Why am I home?’ So I came out as bi, which was very true.” She still identifies as bisexual. Her mother took her back home, Jenkins says, thinking “maybe this is a phase”. “I knew at that time I was trans, but again I could just not accept it for myself, and so consequently could not tell my parents or anybody about it,” she says.",
            "Instead Jenkins married a woman in her mid-20s, and had a daughter who remains “the absolute love of my life”. It was only after she divorced at the age of 30 that she came out as a trans woman. “I just really realised that I can’t go on any more, hiding the truth from myself. Hiding the truth from those who I love. If I am going to thrive in life, I have to come to grips with who I am, and I have to accept it.”",
            "She eventually returned to college and finished her bachelor’s degree at 38, and went on to complete two master’s degrees. Her family are now fully supportive. “They still love me. They still support me. And it took some time to get to that with my immediate family in the very beginning. But people were willing to work through it, people stayed engaged. They did not banish me from existence, which is a lot more than what some families give.”",
            "Jenkins was elected in 2017 with more than 70% of the vote, and was voted vice-president of the council shortly afterwards. She had spent decades in local government beforehand, working as a policy aide to other council members and building up strong grassroots networks. Did she feel she was overqualified at the point, in her late 50s, when she launched her campaign? “I don’t believe in the word overqualified. You’re either qualified, or you’re not,” she says, laughing knowingly. “I do feel like being a Black, trans woman made it really important for me to be qualified for the role. Some people can be a reality TV star, and fucking become president. But some of us others have to really pay dues.”",
            "Transgender women, and particularly trans women of colour, face “an epidemic” of violence in US society, according to the American Medical Association. Last year, at least 44 transgender and gender non-conforming people were murdered in the US, the highest annual death toll recorded according to the Human Rights Campaign. The grim reality only serves to underline the significance of Jenkins’s political career. Although her jurisdiction may be limited, she still hears from transgender people from all over the state and the country seeking guidance and help. “I have not personally experienced violence, thank God,” she says. “But I’ve certainly experienced humiliation and verbal abuse.” There were “traumatic” and “potentially debilitating” slurs that she doesn’t wish to spell out.",
            "Donald Trump’s assault on the rights of the LGBTQ+ community only heightened the climate of persecution. During Trump’s time as president, the administration introduced a raft of anti-trans legislation, from a transgender military ban, to loosening protections in medical care and other public services by narrowing the legal definition of sex discrimination. During his first public appearance out of office, at last month’s Conservative Political Action Conference, Trump used a rambling speech to make a number of transphobic slurs, pushing the issue further into the rightwing culture wars that continue to rage even after his comprehensive defeat in the presidential election.",
            "Joe Biden has already repealed some of the executive action Trump took to curtail LGBTQ+ rights. But, says Jenkins, the administration needs to follow through with its pledge to sign the Equality Act, which would ban discrimination against people based on sexual orientation and gender identity. The bill has already passed the House, but, with a razor-thin Democratic majority in the Senate, its overall fate remains unclear. Away from federal legislation, over which she has no political control, Jenkins hopes that, within the next two decades, the global discussion around gender identity will have moved far beyond the stasis of the past few years.",
            "“This thing that we call gender, it’s going to be so different 25 years from now,” she says. “The reality that there are more than two binary gender identities will be, I believe, widely accepted and widely realised by people in the world. It’s only a matter of time. This whole conservative movement … is a last gasp to hold on to power and authority.”",
            "In Minneapolis, where Jenkins holds her formal political power, she has played a pivotal role in the city’s reimagining of its public safety and policing. The city council had initially considered disbanding its entire police department, a drastic move that was eventually reconsidered, leading instead to a swathe of budget transparency measures, oversight and reallocation of resources. The most striking of which was reallocating nearly $8m into launching new mental health teams that will respond to certain 911 calls.",
            "Jenkins is positive about the reforms, but honest. “To be quite frank with you, I am not sure if anything has really changed or if anything really will change. Because it’s in people’s hearts,” she says. “When those cops are out there on the streets, it doesn’t matter how many fucking rules I make. When they killed Jamar Clark [an unarmed African American man killed by Minneapolis police in 2015] that took 61 seconds – from the second the police arrived until Jamar Clark had a bullet in his brain. So I can make them have a body camera, I can give them de-escalation training, and all of these things, and he still fucking shoots the kid in 61 seconds.”",
            "It sounds almost as though, despite being an elected representative, she still feels a sense of powerlessness. “You know what gives me a sense of powerlessness?” she asks, pointing out that we are talking just days after 43 Republican senators voted to acquit Trump in his second impeachment trial. “The United States Senate said that white supremacy is OK. That breaking the rules for white men is fine. We don’t give a fuck. But if you so much as sneeze in the wrong direction, Black man, we will kill you in the streets.”",
            "She checks herself for a second and takes a breath. “Yes, I’m a policymaker, but all of these systems are so ingrained around us,” she says. “I’ve got to be optimistic that things can change, right? I’ve got to maintain hope. That’s the only thing that has really kept Black people in survival in this country; hope.”"

        "body": [
            "On Wednesday night, the House of Representatives voted to pass the George Floyd Act, named after the Black man killed by Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin last summer. Among many reforms, the act seeks to ban racial profiling, overhaul qualified immunity for police, and ban the use of chokeholds. While these seem like good measures, they are woefully insufficient to stop police violence. These reforms could not have even saved George Floyd’s life.",
            "To be clear, Floyd did not die from a chokehold. A police officer put his knee to Floyd’s neck for eight minutes and 46 seconds. A medical examiner’s autopsy reported “cardiopulmonary arrest complicating law enforcement subdual, restraint and neck compression”. Floyd also had blunt force trauma to his head, face and shoulders. Banning chokeholds is important, as we should reduce the number of tactics that the police can employ to be dangerous. However, the problem with policing is precisely that – they can kill people using a diverse number of tactics. Shooting, kneeling, punching, suffocating, Tasing. Congress banned one practice, and not even the one responsible for the homicide.",
            "",
            "Floyd was also probably not racially profiled. He did not have to be if he was breaking the law. Reportedly, Floyd tried to use a counterfeit $20 bill at a corner store. The clerk called the police because using counterfeit money is illegal. The definition of racial profiling is when police uses someone’s race to suspect that they have committed a crime. Here, Floyd’s act may have constituted a crime and the police showed up to fix it. What’s more criminal than counterfeit cash is the society where people live off of these transactions in corner stores in the first place. The police cannot solve this problem. They can show up and attempt to stop the crime, but they can’t stop the underlying conditions that give rise to it: class exploitation and poverty. Floyd appeared to need cash, not the police.",
            "Congress has had several opportunities to give people what they actually need under the pandemic: money. George Floyd had tested positive for Covid-19 in April. By the time of his death, lawmakers had only distributed $1,200 to the public, and not everyone received this stimulus check. I wonder if Floyd would have used a counterfeit $20 if Congress would have issued $2,000 a month to the public as several activists and progressive legislators have been demanding. George Floyd’s blood is on their hands.",
            "But instead, Congress does what it always does when the police kill people: give cops more money. The George Floyd Act, named after someone who died because he didn’t have money to cover cigarettes, gives millions of dollars to police in grants. And lawmakers gave the police more money right after they failed to secure a $15 federal minimum wage and failed to deliver on the $2,000 checks they promised to voters who put Democrats in office. But, Congress made sure to include $750m in the George Floyd Act to investigate the deadly use of force by law enforcement. Protesters have been demanding to defund the police to keep us safe; not spend millions of dollars to investigate how we die. We know how we die – the police.",
            "The Democratic party has repeatedly said “Black Lives Matter” since the Ferguson uprising in 2014. The Democratic national convention featured images and families involved in racial justice protests. Yet the party has mostly downright ignored the largest network of Black-led organizations, the Movement for Black Lives, who have been demanding that lawmakers pass the Breathe Act, the most comprehensive criminal legal package in the history of the United States. Representatives Ayanna Pressley and Rashida Tlaib announced the legislation last summer. The Breathe Act invests resources in all communities to alleviate police violence by building sustainable neighborhoods and reducing contact with law enforcement. The Act calls for investments in gainful employment, quality housing, and pilots for universal basic income. But Congress would rather pay for police than give resources to the masses of people suffering police violence.",
            "And under the George Floyd Act, police will still kill more than 1,000 people every year. The victims will be overwhelmingly poor, Black, and disabled.",
            "I completely understand that the political climate might require some compromises on the bill text. Top Democrats will hide behind these arguments to suggest that they will not find support for more progressive legislation. But political will starts with them to plant the seeds among their colleagues to make this possible. They cannot use their Republican colleagues as a shield from criticism when it is actually them, Democrats, who are not committed to more transformational policies. Vice-President Kamala Harris could have overruled the Senate parliamentarian who decided to remove the $15 minimum wage from the new Covid-19 relief package; she did not. The speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, could have stood up and championed the Breathe Act; she kneeled for a photo opportunity wearing Kente cloth instead. And Joe Biden could have kept his promise for $2,000 checks for people facing evictions, hunger and unemployment; he and the first lady put giant hearts on the White House lawn for Valentine’s Day instead.",

Aceasta a spus că participanții vor primi măști și gel dezinfectant, dar nu există obligația ca participanții să le folosească. Participanților le va fi de asemenea verificată temperatura la intrare, dar nu va exista ca cerință distanțarea socială în interior.",
            "Trump plănuiește de asemenea un eveniment în aer liber, la care oficialii așteaptă 100.000 de oameni.",
            "Mitingul vine la o zi după ce șeful OMS a avertizat că lumea intră într-o ”nouă și periculoasă fază”, în timp ce statele relaxează măsuri, iar pandemia s-ar putea accelera."

            "Cunoscutul economist american Nouriel Roubini nu crede că economia globală se va redresa rapid. El consideră că actuala situație gravă va duce la o vară de proteste în SUA și la ani de dificultăți în Europa.",
            "”A fost nevoie să treacă ani după 1929 pentru ca întreaga amploare a crizei să devină vizibilă. Comparativ cu astăzi, a fost ca un accident feroviar văzut cu încetinitorul. Acum economia mondială s-a prăbușit în numai câteva săptămâni și, numai în SUA, peste 40 de milioane de oameni sunt șomeri. Mulți cred că economia își va reveni la loc la fel de repede, dar aceasta e o eroare”, crede economistul.",
            "Roubini: Colapsul e chiar mai mare decât a fost atunci. A fost nevoie să treacă ani după 1929 pentru ca întreaga amploare a crizei să devină vizibilă. Comparativ cu astăzi, a fost ca un accident feroviar văzut cu încetinitorul. Acum economia mondială s-a prăbușit în numai câteva săptămâni și, numai în SUA, peste 40 de milioane de oameni sunt șomeri. Mulți cred că economia își va reveni la loc la fel de repede, dar aceasta e o eroare.",
            ".",
            "Roubini: Sigur, vom vedea o relansare în a doua jumătate a anului. Dar nu va fi una reală, ci o iluzie. Economia s-a prăbușit atât de grav încât e practic inevitabil ca la un moment dat să înceapă să crească din nou. Dar acest lucru nu va compensa colapsul în niciun fel. Chiar și la finalul lui 2021, economia americană se va afla tot sub nivelul de la începutul lui 2020; sunt prea multe avarii. Iar șomajul se va stabiliza undeva pe la 16 sau 17% - în cursul crizei financiare a fost doar 10%. Slujbele create în mai au fost numai 2,4 milioane, după ce 42 de milioane și-au pierdut locurile de muncă în ultimele câteva luni. Iar rata reală a șomajului e de fapt mult mai mare decât o dau măsurătorile oficiale.",
            "Roubini: Piața bursieră se autoamăgește. Investitorii pariază că vor urma noi pachete de stimuli și o redresare în „V” a profiturilor. Dar pentru oamenii de aici, din SUA, acest lucru nu înseamnă nimic.",
            "Roubini: Pe Wall Street marile corporații dau tonul, în special băncile și companiile tehnologice. Ele vor supraviețui crizei întrucât statul nu va permite niciodată ca ele să se scufunde. Vor da oameni afară, vor reduce costurile și, în cele din urmă, vor avea chiar mai multă putere pe piață decât înainte. Dar ceea ce numim noi aici „Main Street”, companiile mici și mijlocii, nu pot face același lucru. Ele dau pur și simplu faliment. Estimez că unul din două restaurante din orașul New York va fi nevoit să se închidă, dar McDonald's va supraviețui. Însă asta nu e tot.",
            "Roubini: Cei mai bogați 10% dintre americani dețin 80% din valoarea pieței bursiere, în vreme ce 75% nu dețin nici măcar o acțiune. Este un studiu realizat de Rezerva Federală (Fed), conform căruia 40% dintre americani nu au 400 de dolari bani gheață pentru a fi pregătiți pentru urgențe. Acea urgență o trăim acum. Sistemul e bolnav, iar oamenii ies în stradă din acest motiv.",
            "Roubini: Bineînțeles! În zona în care locuiesc eu, Bowery în Lower Manhattan, trei sferturi din manifestanți sunt albi. Mulți dintre ei sunt tineri și fac parte din „precariat”-ul urban, noua subclasă care a substituit clasa muncitoare tradițională, proletariatul, în economiile avansate bazate pe servicii. Precariatul e constituit din lucrători cu contracte temporare, liber profesioniști, oameni care muncesc cu ora, lucrători „gig” [tot independenți/temporari, dar în special în sfera digitală - n.trad.], contractanți - în ciuda faptului că ei dețin adesea o diplomă universitară. Cei care nu sunt angajați cu normă întreagă nu mai primesc ajutor de la stat după trei luni. Și atunci acești oameni nu-și mai pot plăti chiria și factura telefonică, iar curentul electric și apa le sunt tăiate. Va fi o vară lungă și fierbinte.",
            "Roubini: Ai dreptate. Dar Joe Biden va trebui să câștige cu o marjă foarte mare pentru ca Donald Trump să plece de bunăvoie de la Washington. Însă eu prezic că nu așa se va întâmpla. Fie Trump își va păstra la limită funcția, chiar dacă susținerea lui se disipează în rândurile clasei muncitoare albe care l-a așezat în funcție. Fie va pierde cu o marjă foarte mică, dar nu va accepta rezultatul.",
            "Roubini: Firește. Trump nu se duce la Curtea Supremă, ca Al Gore, să ceară o renumărare a voturilor dacă rezultatele vor fi strânse în unele circumscripții. El va da vina pe China, Rusia, pe negri sau pe imigranți și se va comporta precum un dictator de republică bananieră. Își va chema adepții să se ridice la arme - sunt destui fasciști albi înarmați mișunând pe acolo. El le reamintește suficient de des despre Al Doilea Amendament, care le permite americanilor să dețină arme.",
            "Roubini: Fed a făcut deja tot felul de lucruri pe care nu era obligată să le facă. A salvat bănci, investitori financiari, fonduri speculative și administratori de active inundând piețele cu lichidități. Era lucrul corect de făcut pe termen scurt pentru a evita deflația. Dar datoria publică e atât de mare încât guvernele și companiile nu se pot refinanța dacă rata dobânzii rămâne extrem de scăzută. Fed trebuie să se asigure de acest lucru prin cumpărarea de obligațiuni, mărindu-le astfel prețul și diminuând rata dobânzii. Pe termen lung, nu va ieși din acest comportament. Fed e în aceeași situație în care sunt toate marile bănci centrale din lume.",
            "Roubini: Absolut. Uite: în decembrie 2018 președintele Fed Jerome Powell a anunțat că va mări rata dobânzii și va reduce bilanțul băncii centrale prin încetarea cumpărării de obligațiuni. Drept urmare, piața bursieră a căzut cu 20%. Powell a bătut rapid în retragere, și bilanțul Fed de astăzi e dublu față de cât era atunci. Pe termen lung acest lucru va duce la inflație.",
            "Roubini: Pentru că vom avea un șoc negativ de partea ofertei. Poate sună tehnic, dar se poate explica ușor.",
            "Roubini: Globalizarea a menținut costurile cu mâna de lucru și producția la un nivel scăzut vreme de ani, fie și numai din cauza celor 2,5 miliarde de muncitori ieftini din India și China. Dar globalizarea a trecut deja de vârful [„peak”, punct după care nu mai poate exista creștere din nou - n.trad.] ei după criza financiară, iar pandemia a intensificat această tendință. Suntem martori la renaționalizare, la dezintegrarea lanțurilor de aprovizionare, la un conflict comercial între China și SUA.",
            "Roubini: Să luăm ca exemplu tehnologia 5G: Nokia și Ericsson sunt cu 30% mai scumpe și cu 20% mai puțin eficiente decât Huawei. Deci, dacă o țară decide să nu apeleze la Huawei pentru expansiunea 5G, și există motive întemeiate de securitate pentru a proceda astfel, prețurile a tot felul de produse finale, de la servicii 5G până la prăjitoare de pâine și cuptoare cu microunde cu cipuri 5G, vor crește automat. Iar acest lucru duce în cele din urmă la inflație.",
            "Roubini: Conform manualului, da, dar nu se va întâmpla așa. Altfel statele și firmele și-ar face praf și pulbere bugetele și bilanțurile.",
            "Roubini: Nu chiar. În definitiv, ce contează cu adevărat e integritatea zonei euro. Fără un act de solidaritate, Italia, în special, ar intra în colaps și ar ieși din uniunea monetară. Și atunci totul s-ar termina.",
            "Roubini: Evident, exagerează. Pachetul e cât se poate de în regulă, dar lipsesc două precondiții esențiale pentru un stat federal european: în primul rând punerea în comun a pasivelor - datoria Italiei tot datoria Italiei rămâne. Și, în al doilea rând, un buget comun de dimensiuni semnificative, de exemplu 20 sau 30% din PIB, iar nu doar 2%, cum stau lucrurile acum.",
            "Roubini: Nu poți să spui mereu „nu” la orice! Berlinul nu poate să fie împotriva faptului că bugetul UE crește și că Banca Centrală Europeană joacă un rol mai important, și în același timp să mai fie și surprins când totul începe să se ducă de râpă. Atunci Europa ar fi moartă! Din fericire, cancelarul Angela Merkel a realizat la timp care este miza. Și ea este atât de populară pe moment încât își permite să ia asemenea măsuri. Mă îndoiesc că așa ceva va mai fi posibil sub succesorul ei, indiferent cine va veni la conducerea partidului ei și a guvernului.",
            "Roubini: Eu vorbesc regulat cu reprezentanți ai guvernului britanic și am impresia că ei se îndreaptă în mod clar spre un Brexit dur. Londra nu vrea un acord de liber-schimb precum cel dintre UE și Canada, guvernul chiar vrea o separare deplină. Ceea ce e, bineînțeles, o nebunie. Camioanele se vor strânge claie peste grămadă la vămile de la graniță, piețele bursiere ale Europei vor cădea drastic, și economia britanică la fel, iar economia europeană va cădea și ea, deși nu la fel de mult."

Avem de-a face cu o masivă problemă rasială, ca în SUA, sau cazurile individuale sunt dramatizate peste măsură, într-o țară care și-a asumat vina discriminărilor naziste și a corectat-o postbelic, primind pe teritoriul său milioane de imigranți? Vanessa H., o afro-germană din Berlin, aparent jignită de casiera unui magazin și de un polițist, face tot posibilul să convingă că nici Germania nu și-a făcut temele la capitolul rasism.",
            "Într-un videoclip postat pe net și rezumat vineri de Tagesspiegel, aflăm povestea relatată de aceasta. Marți după-amiază, Vanessa H. tocmai iși ridicase fiul în vârstă de patru ani de la grădiniță și mai voia să facă mici cumpărături. La casa de marcat a unei drogherii Rossmann, tânăra de 24 de ani a vrut să plătească cu cardul, cei sub 15 euro. Casiera i-ar fi cerut semnătura și actul de identitate.",
            "„Vanessa H. s-a născut la Berlin, a crescut pe Kurfürstendamm, a lucrat și ea în magazine și poartă un nume tipic german”, precizează Tagesspiegel. Aparent, casiera nu își poate imagina că o femeie cu pielea neagră poartă un nume german și folosește cardul CE, pentru o plată de 15 euro.",
            "„Ea a spus, cu voce tare, că acesta nu este numele meu”, spune Vanessa H., în videoclipul pe care îl postează pe Instagram și care a circulat pe rețelele de socializare. „O femeie neagră nu poate avea deloc un astfel de card”, zice ea că ar fi comentat casiera. H. s-a enervat, a intrat într-o controversă cu aceasta, până când a apărut și șefa care, contrar așteptărilor lui H., și-ar fi susținut subalterna în observația că acesta nu poate fi cardul clientei.",
            "„Atunci am spus că voi suna la poliție, pentru că e rasism”, relatează Vanessa pentru Tagesspiegel. Ea adaugă că una dintre cele două angajate ale magazinului ar fi remarcat: „Oh, acum vine textul cu rasismul, pentru că sunteți neagră”.",
            "Lanțul de drogherii Rossmann a comentat cazul după cum urmează: „Noi regretăm foarte mult ceea ce a pățit clienta noastră în filiala din Berlin. În prezent, analizăm intern incidentul, pentru a trage concluziile necesare”. O purtătoare de cuvânt consideră că „angajații companiei ar trebui să fie și mai conștienți de rasismul cotidian”.",

H. era supărată, fiul ei plângea. „Un polițist a fost super-drăguț, a avut grijă de fiul meu”, a spus ea. Alt polițist a intrat în magazin și a vorbit cu personalul. Când acesta a ieșit, Vanessa spune că ar fi acuzat-o că a mințit.",
            "În cazul unei declarații false, o așteaptă închisoarea, ar fi amenințat-o polițistul. Vanessa a mai spus: „El m-a întrebat dacă înțeleg vreun pic limba germană”. Jignită, aceasta i-a cerut numele și numărul de pe legitimație.",
            "Acum, poliția cercetează cazul. Un purtător de cuvânt al poliției a spus că „a fost inițiată o plângere penală pentru suspiciunea de insultă cu motivație rasială”. Comportamentul polițiștilor este verificat de biroul de reclamații al poliției.",
            "Vanessa H. mai susține: „Nu sunt singura care a experimentat ceva de genul acesta, este ceva obișnuit pentru noi, oamenii de culoare, dar niciodată nu a fost atât de șocant, ca poliția să încerce să mă jignească”.",
            "Vanessa H. a participat împreună cu fiul ei de patru ani, Idris, la demonstrația „Black Lives Matter” de la Alexanderplatz, din Berlin. Ea ținea o pancartă pe care scria: „Umanitatea mea nu trebuie pusă la îndoială”.",
            "În weekendul trecut, peste 100.000 de oameni au ieșit în stradă, pentru a protesta împotriva violenței polițiștilor și a rasismului.",

            "Agenția federală de combatere a discriminării a primit anul trecut semnificativ mai multe apeluri în acest sens decât înainte. Cei mai afectați s-au plâns, cel mai adesea, că au fost dezavantajați, din cauza originii etnice, la locul de muncă sau în viața de zi cu zi.",
            "Berlinul a devenit acum primul stat federal care protejează împotriva discriminării, cu o legislație proprie, oferind celor afectați posibilitatea de a apela la lege altfel decât în trecut. Factorul decisiv este inversarea probei: în viitor, aceasta nu va mai trebui furnizată de victimă, ci de inculpat, care trebuie să demonstreze că acuzația de discriminare este neîntemeiată.",
            "Uniunea de guvernământ, liberalii și poliția au fost subiectul unor critici dure și se tem de un val de procese împotriva forțelor de ordine. Lidera partidului SPD, Saskia Esken, a spus că există un rasism latent în rândurile poliției, o acuzație pe care nici tovarășii săi de partid și nici liderii altor partide germane nu o împartășesc neapărat.",
            "Cert este însă că există atacuri rasiste ale poliției și activități extremiste de dreapta, uneori însoțite de violență. Însă cât de amplu e fenomenul? Un polițist care are experiență cu anumite grupuri de făptuitori și, prin urmare, îi controlează mai îndeaproape decât pe alții, este automat rasist? Deoarece lipsesc datele privind rasismul în randurile poliției, guvernul federal dorește ca acest lucru să fie concret analizat."

Alături de această informaţie, a fost prezentat şi single-ul „False Prophet”.Acesta este al treilea single al lui Dylan lansat în ultimele şase săptămâni, după „Murder Most Foul” şi „I Contain Multitudes”. Bob Dylan, laureat cu premiul Nobel pentru Literatură în 2016, a respins mereu titlul de profet. „Te simţi ca un impostor când cineva crede că eşti ceva ce nu eşti”, spunea el în 2004, citează Rolling Stone. „Nu am vrut niciodată să fiu un profet sau salvator. Elvis, poate. M-aş fi putut vedea uşor devenind el, dar profet? Nu”. Cel mai recent album cu piese originale al lui Dylan a fost „Tempest”, lansat în 2012. De atunci a mai lansat trei colecţii: „Shadows in the Night”, „Fallen Angels” şi „Triplicate”.„Rough and Rowdy Ways” va fi al 39-lea album de studio al muzicianului în 57 de ani de la debut.Robert Allen Zimmerman, cunoscut drept Bob Dylan, s-a născut pe 24 mai 1941, este cântăreţ, compozitor, textier şi poet american. Prin versurile sale, publicate în volume sau transpuse pe muzică, el a marcat cultura americană în a doua jumătate a secolului al XX-lea.Majoritatea compoziţiilor lui au devenit emblematice pentru mişcările anti-război şi pentru drepturile civile la scară mondială. Dintre albumele care au marcat istoria muzicii se numără „The Times They Are a-Changin'” (1964), „Blonde on Blonde” (1966), „Oh Mercy” (1989), „Good as I Been to You (1992)” şi „Together Through Life” (2009).",

Ambele țări au inundat social media, mai ales Twitter, cu hashtag-uri legate de cazul George Floyd și de proteste, scopul fiind semănarea disensiunii în SUA. Este o metodă pe care Rusia a folosit-o și cu ocazia alegerilor din 2016 în SUA, când a plasat conținut legat de rasism, pe rețelele de socializare, pentru a incita la conflicte rasiale.

Conturile Blacktivist distribuiau conținut menit să stârnească ultraj. „Oamenii negri ar trebui să se trezească cât mai curând”, era unul dintre mesajele de pe Twitter. „Familiile negre sunt distruse de încarcerarea în masă și moartea bărbaților negri”, era alt mesaj.",

            "Unul din cei patru foşti poliţişti albi din Minneapolis acuzat în dosarul morţii afro-americanului George Floyd a depus cauţiunea de 750.000 de dolari şi a fost eliberat miercuri, scrie Reuters, citată de Agerpres.",
            "Thomas Lane, în vârstă de 37 de ani, a fost pus în libertate din penitenciarul din comitatul Hennepin din statul Minnesota, arată documentele biroului şerifului. Lane este unul din cei trei presupuşi complici la uciderea lui Floyd, în vârstă de 46 de ani, de către fostul poliţist Derek Chauvin.",
            "Chauvin a fost filmat în 25 mai ţinându-şi genunchiul pe gâtul lui Floyd timp de aproape nouă minute, până când acesta a decedat. Concediat ulterior din poliţia din Minneapolis alături de ceilalţi trei colegi participanţi la intervenţie, Chauvin nu a ţinut seama că suspectul de culoare pe care îl aresta, deja încătuşat şi culcat la pământ, s-a plâns de mai multe ori că nu poate respira.",
            "Earl Gray, avocatul lui Lane, nu a răspuns apelurilor telefonice ale agenţiei Reuters, care încerca să obţină o reacţie la eliberarea pe cauţiune a clientului său, dar a declarat presei că acesta a încercat de fapt să îl ajute pe Floyd. Avocatul a comunicat ziarului Minneapolis Star-Tribune că pentru strângerea banilor pentru cauţiune s-a organizat o colectă de fonduri online, prin care se solicitau plăţi prin serviciul PayPal.",
            "Chauvin rămâne în arest sub acuzaţia de omor. Cauţiunea pentru el a fost fixată de un judecător la 1,25 milioane de dolari. Foştii agenţi Tou Thao şi Alexander Kueng, ceilalţi doi presupuşi complici, ar trebui să depună pentru eliberare câte 750.000 de dolari, la fel ca şi Lane.",
            "Conform practicii judiciare din Minnesota, acuzaţii nu trebuie să se declare vinovaţi sau nevinovaţi la audierile preliminare în instanţă. Următorul termen pentru Lang este 29 iunie, iar potrivit presei avocatul său intenţionează să depună o cerere de respingere a acuzaţiilor.",
            "Moartea lui Floyd a fost urmată de proteste antirasiste, în unele cazuri violente şi însoţite de jafuri şi incendieri. Miercuri a fost a 16-a zi consecutivă în care au avut loc astfel de manifestații. Mulţi activişti au cerut interzicerea strangulării şi a altor metode de imobilizare utilizate de către poliţie. Forţele de ordine au fost criticate şi pentru intervenţiile dure împotriva protestatarilor din multe oraşe, cu gaze lacrimogene, petarde şi bastoane.",
            "La Portland, în statul Oregon, peste 1000 de oameni au blocat miercuri traficul în centrul oraşului şi au cerut demisia primarului. La Portsmouth, în Virginia, demonstranţii au deteriorat un monument al Confederaţiei statelor din sud, care reamintea de războiul de secesiune din SUA din 1861-1865, în urma căruia a fost abolită sclavia în ciuda rezistenţei Sudului."

Urâm pe drept, dacă nu suntem pervertiţi moral, degradarea omului prefăcut in marfă, de către oameni care se degradează şi pe ei inşişi ori de câte ori îi tratează pe alţii ca şi cum n-ar aparţine umanităţii, ci regnului animal, sau ar fi, pur şi simplu, obiecte. Ne indignează pe bună dreptate disprețul sau ura generate de diferenţe de culoare ale pielii. Rasismul ne apare azi ca o enormitate intelectuală şi ca o abjecţie morală, ca o lezare a ceea ce e mai sfânt şi mai înălţător în om. Pare deci de înţeles ca nu puţini să considere o provocare existenţa, în spaţiul public, a unor statui înfăţişându-i pe niste foşti negustori de sclavi. Aşa era, la Bristol, cea dedicată marelui filantrop Edward Colston, un prosper negustor care nu s-a rezumat să participe, acum aproape patru veacuri, la ceea ce azi, altfel decat în epocă, ne apare clar ca ticăloşia comerţului cu robi africani, ci a făcut şi enorm de mult bine urbei sale. În spitalele, școlile și azilurile căreia şi-a pompat substanțiale părţi din avere.Faptele bune n-au salvat sculptura reprezentându-l. Lucrarea s-a văzut smulsă de pe soclu, târâtă spre apa râului Avon şi scufundată la doar o sută de kilometri de Stratford, oraşul natal al lui Shakespeare. Cine sunt călăii statuii? Tineri protestatari revoltaţi de genunchiul alb ţinut aproape nouă minute de către un poliţist american pe grumazul negru al recent înmormântatului George Floyd, un urmaş al sclavilor traficaţi până în secolul XIX inclusiv de Colston. Şi scandalizați de biografia lui.Nici statuia învingătorului nazismului n-a scăpat de obscenităţile unora din demonstranţii britanici. S-au găsit protestatari să urineze pe statuia londoneză a celui rămas ani la rând singurul lider apusean dotat cu temeritatea şi capacitatea de a-i ţine piept lui Hitler. Sinistrul erou suprem al naziştilor, iar azi al suprematiştilor albi, al rasiştilor și antisemiţilor radicali, s-a şocat văzându-şi gripată mândra Luftwaffe şi eficienta maşinărie de război care cucerise, anterior, Europa. Le-a venit de hac Royal Air Force a lui Winston Churchill, în Bătălia Angliei, prima victorie aliată înaintea înfrângerii definitive a liderului totalitar german."

            "Secretarul de stat a adăugat: ”Legat de termometrizare, știm iarăși din practică, copiii fac forme ușoare de boală, majoritatea sunt asimptomatici și atunci termometrizarea în cazul lor nu ar aduce… nu are o sensibilitate mare și este ineficientă.

Părintele să evalueze starea de sănătate, să termometrizeze copilul, atunci când are febră sau prezintă simptome respiratorii copilul nu trebuie adus la școală. Este o măsură obligatorie, de bun simț, dar pe care, din păcate, știm cu toții că în anii trecuți nu s-a aplicat niciodată și copiii răciți, tușind, cu febră, cu antibiotice, cu tratament erau aduși la școală”, a declarat secretarul de stat.",

Până atunci, SUA vor fi izolate mai multe luni în încercarea de a combate răspândirea coronavirusului. Potrivit The Telegraph, Fauci a făcut un apel, în încercarea de a opri oamenii să mai iasă în stradă să demonstreze împotriva rasismului, iar dacă sunt hotărâți să o facă, măcar să poarte mască. ",

            "Chauvin este cel care i-a ţinut genunchiul pe gât, timp de 8 minute şi 46 de secunde, bărbatului de culoare George Floyd, 46 de ani, în timp ce acesta se plângea că nu poate să respire. Floyd a decedat ulterior, iar scena a declanşat ample proteste antirasiste şi față de violenţele poliţiei, în SUA şi pe plan mondial.",

Alți trei ofițeri implicați în arestarea lui George Floyd, Thomas Lane, JA Keung și Tou Thao, au fost, de asemenea, concediați și se confruntă cu acuzații. Între timp, Lane a fost eliberat pentru o cauțiune de 750.000 $.",

Oficialii asociației au spus că toți angajații sunt eligibili pentru pensie, cu excepția cazului în care aleg ei să-și piardă beneficiile.",

            "Mai mulți factori sunt folosiți pentru a calcula nivelul de pensie, însă Chauvin ar putea fi eligibil pentru pachetul de bază de 50.000 $ pe an. Potrivit unei analize bazate pe contractul polițistului, beneficiile s-ar putea ridica până la 1,5 milioane de dolari pe o perioadă de 30 de ani, fără a include alte sporuri.",

Povestea lui emoționantă a fost publicată de CNN. ",

În loc să protesteze pașnic în memoria lui Floyd, unii distrugeau un oraș care e, de fapt, foarte frumos”.",

            "Departamentele de poliție din SUA au beneficiat de finanțări uriașe și de ajutorul direct al Pentagonului pentru a se dota cu un arsenal militar impresionant, care a creat o cultură a intervențiilor violente, scriu experții americani în publicațiile The Conversation și The New York Review of Books. Această cultură a militarizării este vizibilă nu doar în viața de zi cu zi, în misiunile obișnuite ale poliției, soldate cu numeroase victime, dar și la protestele din ultimele zile. ",
            "Protestele izbucnite în SUA după moartea lui George Floyd, un bărbat de culoare, în custodia poliției, au generat ciocniri violente cu forțele de ordine, care au transformat unele zone ale orașelor americane în adevărate zone de război.",
            "Protestatarii și organizațiile civile au acuzat agresivitatea forțelor de ordine, iar în cel puțin un caz au și acționat în judecată autoritățile, inclusiv pe președintele Donald Trump.",
            "În fața manifestanților mai pașnici sau mai violenți, polițiștii americani și-au scos întregul arsenal de care orice armată ar fi mândră: vehicule blindate, elicoptere militare, gloanțe de lemn sau de cauciuc, grenade cu gaze lacrimogene.",
            "Vederea vehiculelor blindate rezistente la mine şi protejate contra ambuscadelor (MRAP) la protestele din Minneapolis, Seattle, Los Angeles sau Philadephia este deja o normalitate, observă într-un articol pentru The New York Review of Books Michael Shank, de la Centrul pentru Afaceri Globale al Universității New York.",
            "Militarizarea poliției din SUA a devenit o obișnuință după atacurile teroriste din 11 septembrie 2001 și în ciuda unor eforturi ulterioare de ”dezarmare”, puține lucruri s-au schimbat.",
            "Această tendință de militarizare pare să fie în directă corelare cu violența poliției și cu răspunsul agresiv al forțelor de ordine la proteste, scrie pentru publicația The Conversation Tom Nolan, profesor de sociologie la Emmanuel College, din Boston, fost ofițer de poliție timp de 27 de ani.",
            "Multe departamente de poliție au primit echipamentul militar direct de la Pentagon, în cadrul unui program demarat sub administrația președintelui Bill Clinton.",
            "Programul 1033 al Agenției Logistice pentru Apărare presupune transferul gratuit de echipament de care armata nu mai are nevoie către forțele de poliție din întreaga țară.",
            "Această inițiativă cere departamentelor de poliție să folosească echipamentul în maxim un an de la recepționare.",
            "Departamentul pentru Securitate Internă are și un program antitero, finanțat cu zeci de miliarde de dolari, prin care forțele de poliție pot cumpăra separat, echipament militar, direct de la producători.",
            "Au existat unele eforturi de a de-escalada acest program de militarizare. Senatorii Brian Schatz, un democrat, și Rand Paul, un republican, au introdus în mod repetat un proiect de lege bipartizan în acest sens.",
            "Președintele Barack Obama a introdus în 2015 o serie de restricții în privința echipamentului care poate fi transferat către departamentele de poliție direct de pe front.",
            "Ordinul său a interzis, spre exemplu, transferul de vehicule blindate cu protecție balistică, aeronave dotate cu sisteme de tragere, lansatoare de grenade și altele.",
            "În primul său an la Casa Albă, Donald Trump a eliminat toate restricțiile impuse de Obama. Proiectele de lege depuse în Congres nu s-au concretizat niciodată.",
            "Criticii acestui proces de militarizare au sugerat că mesajul transmis polițiștilor este că sunt, practic, într-un război.",
            "De altfel, instruirea polițiștilor pentru a se comporta ca niște soldați, a fost parte a unui program de training foarte popular printre unii ofițeri de poliție.",
            "Astfel de programe au fost oferite ofițerilor de poliție americani chiar de militarii israelieni. Potrivit Amnesty International, oficiali din forțele de poliție din Florida, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, California, Arizona, Connecticut, New York, Maryland, Massachusetts, North Carolina, Georgia sau Washington DC au călătorit în Israel pentru a lua parte la program.",
            "Pentru ca polițiștii să se comporte ca militari este însă nevoie de existența unui ”dușman”, iar în orașe sau chiar și în zonele suburbane sau rurale, dușmanii sunt deseori cei care sunt percepuți drept infractori, scrie Tom Nolan, fostul ofițer de poliție.",
            "Un studiu al deceselor provocate de polițiști între 2012 și 2018 a aflat că, în medie, polițiștii americani ucid 2,8 oameni în fiecare zi. Pentru persoanele de culoare, riscul de a fi ucis de un polițist este de 3,2 – 3,5 ori mai mare.",
            "Iar un alt studiu din 2017 arată că există o legătură directă între militarizare și violența poliției. Așa cum au observat autorii studiului în Washington Post, forțele de poliție mai militarizate au fost asociate cu un număr mai mare de civili uciși.",
            "Mai exact, morțile civililor cresc cu până la 130% atunci când departamentele de poliție achiziționează echipament militar.",
            "O corelare între militarizare și violența poliției este observată și într-un studiu al Uniunii Americane pentru Libertăți Civile (ACLU), care denunță folosirea excesivă a forțelor SWAT pentru simple percheziții în dosare privind traficul de droguri în cantități mici.",
            "Prin folosirea fondurilor federale, forțele locale și statale de poliție și-au construit un arsenal militar pnetru a purta un ”război al drogurilor” deja eșuat, câmpul de bătălie fiind în general în comunitățile de culoare. Aceste instrumente și tactici hiperagresive au avut urmări tragice pentru civili și polițiști, escaladând riscul de violențe inutilă, distrugând proprietăți și subminând libertățile individuale.",
            "Efectul acestor tactici este și unul psihologic, potrivit expertului comportamental Denise Herd, care a studiat efectul violenței poliției asupra comunităților.",
            "La începutul acestui an, ea concluziona că ”întâlnirile violente cu poliția generează o puternică reacție în lanț, de diminuare a stării de sănătate și a calității vieții rezidenților care trăiesc în zone unde vecinii sunt uciși, răniți sau traumatizați psihologic”.",
            "Trauma produsă de clipul video care a surprins ultimele minute de viață ale lui George Floyd este evidentă prin reacția pe care a produs-o, observă Tom Nolan, fostul polițist.",
            "Exprții, a arătat un material difuzat de NBC News, au mai atras atenția că răspunsul militarizat al autorităților la protestele din ultimele zile erodează încrederea oamenilor în forțele de poliție.",
            "Moartea lui George Floyd a determinat Mișcarea Black Lives Matter să relanseze un apel pentru reducerea finanțării departamentelor de poliție și lansarea de investiții pentru susținerea comunităților de culoare, iar petiția adună tot mai mulți susținători.",
            "În alte țări, unde poliția se plânge de lipsă de fonduri, o asemenea solicitare ar putea părea stranie. În SUA, datele oficiale arată însă că departamentele de poliție ale marilor orașe beneficiază de sume exorbitante.",
            "Los Angeles este unul dintre exemple. Departamentul local de poliție, LAPD, primește nu mai puțin de 3,14 miliarde de dolari din totalul de 10,5 miliarde pentru 2020-2021, potrivit cifrelor publicate de revista GQ.",
            "În New York, care are cel mai mare buget acordat poliției, primarul Bill de Blasio cerut o reducere a finanțării cu 23,8 milioane de dolari. Dar suma este infimă și reprezintă doar o mică părticică din bugetul total de 5 miliarde de dolari acordat NYPD.",
            "Mai exact, așa cum a observat Alex Vitale, profesor de sociologie la Brooklyn College, orașul alocă poliției mai mult decât alocă Departamentelor pentru Sănătate, Servicii pentru persoane fără adăpost, Reabilitatea imobilelor și dezvoltare și Tineret la un loc.",
            "La aceste fonduri se adaugă resursele oferite de guvernul federal. Între 1990 și 2017, Pentagonul a transferat echipament militar în valoare de 5,4 miliarde de dolari către departamentele de poliție din întreaga țară.",

            "New York Times a reconstituit, cu ajutorul imaginilor, a mărturiilor din documentele oficiale și a opiniei experților, ce s-a întâmplat în momentele care au dus la moartea lui Floyd.",
            "Totul a început în seara zilei de luni, 25 mai, la 19.57, când doi angajați ai unui magazin îl cer socoteală lui Floyd, aflat într-o mașină parcată, cu privire la o bancontă de 20 de dolari, presupus falsă, pe care acesta ar fi folosit-o să cumpere țigări.",
            "Aceștia cer țigările înapoi, dar nu primesc nimic, așa că, patru minute mai târziu, cheamă poliția. În discuția telefonică unul dintre angajați spune că Floyd a folosit o bancnotă falsă, că este “îngrozitor de beat și că nu se poate controla”.",
            "În scurt timp, o mașină de poliție ajunge la fața locului, iar ofițerii J. Alexander Kueng și Thomas Lane merg la autoturismul lui Floyd. Aproape imediat, după câteva schimburi de vorbe, Lane scoate arma.",
            "Ulterior, ofițerul își pune înapoi arma și îl scoate pe Floyd din mașină, apoi, cei doi polițiști îl încătușează pe bărbat și îl duc pe trotuar.",

            "La șase minute după arestare, cei doi polițiști îl duc pe Floyd spre mașină, în momentul în care acesta cade la pământ.",

            "Amândoi au un număr destul de mare de plângeri depuse împotriva lor – 17 în cazul lui Chauvin, care a fost implicat în trei schimburi de focuri de-a lungul carierei, unul dintre acestea terminat cu moartea unei persoane.",
            "Chauvin se implică în tentativa polițiștilor de a-l băga pe Floyd în mașină și, în scurt timp, îl trage pe bărbat și îl trântește la pământ lângă mașină. Este neclar care a fost motivul.",

            "Imaginile filmate de martori arată că, în ciuda solicitării de asistență medicală, Chauvin continuă să țină genunchiul pe gâtul lui Floyd. A făcut-o deja timp de șapte minute.",
            "Iar Floyd continuă să îl roage să își ridice genunchiul. “Nu pot să respir. Te rog. Genunchiul de pe gâtul meu!”.",
            "Bărbatul le-a spus polițiștilor că nu poate să respire de cel puțin 16 ori în cinci minute. Dar Chauvin continuă să își țină genunchiul pe gâtul omului.",
            "Face asta inclusiv în momentul în care Floyd închide ochii și nu se mai mișcă. În jur, martorii oculari îi strigă polițistului să își ridice genunchiul.",
            "Potrivit experților consultați de New York Times, acțiunile celor patru încalcă mai multe reguli stabilite de departamentele de poliție.",

            "La minute bune după ce au cerut asistență medicală, polițiștii nu fac nici un efort pentru a-l ajuta pe Floyd. Mai mult, Chauvin ține în continuare genunchiul pe gâtul acestuia.",
            "În acest timp, martorii oculari le cer repetat polițistilor să îi ia pulsul și să îl lase în pace.",
            "Potrivit plângerii înaintate împotriva lui Chauvin, celălalt polițist, Thomas Lane, îl întreabă pe acesta de două ori dacă nu ar trebui să îl întoarcă pe suspect pe o parte. Chauvin refuză.",
            "La 20 de minute după arestare, o ambulanță sosește la fața locului, iar un membru al echipei de intervenție ia pulsul lui Floyd.",
            "Dar Chauvin ține genunchiul pe gâtul lui Floyd pentru încă un minut, deși acesta pare complet fără viață. Îl ia în cele din urmă, în momentul în care un membru al echipei medicale îi cere acest lucru.",
            "Ofițerul și-a ținut genunchiul pe gâtul lui Floyd timp de 8 minute și 46 de secunde, potrivit plângerii.",
            "Floyd este în cele din urmă urcat în ambulanță, pe targă, iar mașina pleacă, posibil din cauza faptului că la fața locului se formează o mulțime.",
            "O mașină de pompieri este chemată pentru a da ajutor, dar când aceasta sosește, polițiștii nu oferă detalii clare despre starea lui Floyd sau despre locul unde se află acesta, potrivit raportului oficial al pompierilor.",
            "Asta îi împiedică pe pompieri în misiunea lor de a-i ajuta pe paramedicii care l-au preluat pe Floyd. Acesta a intrat deja în stop cardiac.",
            "Pompierii au nevoie de alte cinci minute pentru a ajunge la Floyd. Prea târziu. I se pronunță decesul, puțin mai târziu, într-un spital din apropiere.",
            "Buletinul preliminar al autopsiei lui Floyd spune că, cel mai probabil, la moartea acestuia au contribuit atât presiunea directă exercitată de poliție, cât și problemele sale cardiace deja existente.",

Sau dacă a fi de culoare înseamnă izolare în casă pentru tot restul vieții, deoarece virusul rasismului care infectează țara este mai mortal decât COVID-19, scrie legenda baschetului american Kareem Abdul-Jabar în Los Angeles Times.",

Dacă ești alb, probabil că mormăi un îngrozit, „O, Dumnezeule!” în timp ce clatini din cap asupra nedreptăţii. Dacă ești de culoare, probabil ai sărit în picioare, ai blestemat, poate ai aruncat cu ceva (cu siguranță ai vrut să arunci cu ceva), în timp ce strigi: „Nu @ # $%! din nou!”, imaginează cele doua variante de răspuns Kareem Abdul-Jabar.",
            "Acesta aminteşte mai multe cazuri în care persoanele de culoare au fost victimele violenţelor şi ale rasismului. Nu este vizat doar un presupus „criminal negru”, ci întregul spectru de fețe de culoare de la Yonkers până la Yale.",
            "Nu vreau să văd că magazinele sunt jefuite, iar clădirile sunt arse, însă afro-americanii trăiesc într-o clădire care arde de mulți ani, iar flăcările ard din ce în ce mai aproape. Rasismul în America este ca praful în aer. Pare invizibil, dar la lumină vedem că este peste tot.",
            "Ce vezi când vezi protestatari de culoare supărați care se strâng în afara secțiilor de poliție cu pumnii ridicați? Dacă ești alb, s-ar putea să te gândești: „Cu siguranță nu sunt distanțări sociale.” Apoi observați fețele negre care jefuiesc și vă gândiți: „Ei bine, asta le face rău cauzei”.",

Dacă locuiești în acea clădire arzătoare, sau o privești la televizor cu un bol de chipsuri de porumb în poală, așteptând să înceapă „NCIS”. Ce vreau să văd nu este o grabă spre judecată, ci o grabă spre dreptate.",

            "Dar, observă New York Times, furia protestatarilor nu este alimentată doar de abuzurile poliției, ci și de inegalitățile dintre populația de culoare și cea albă din Minneapolis, altfel un oraș pitoresc, cu parcuri frumoase, prosper și cu un număr mic de șomeri.",
            "Afro-americanii câștigă cam o treime din venitul rezidenților albi din oraș. Au o rată de absolvire a liceului mult mai redusă, o rată a șomajului mai mare și trăiesc în gospodării cu venituri substanțial mai mici decât ale albilor.",
            "Este ”paradoxul Minnesota”, așa cum l-a numit un profesor universitar – un loc plăcut și prosper, dar care are însă inegalități rasiale majore. Disparitățile, scrie cotidianul american, sunt rezultatul unor politici discriminatorii întinse pe generații.",
            "”Moartea lui George Floyd reprezintă fiecare luptă, fiecare bătălie pentru progresul populației de culoare din acest oraș”, spune Mike Griffin, un rezident implicat în organizarea comunității din Minneapolis.",
            "Vrem dreptate pentru George Floyd, dar vorbim și despre demnitatea populației de culoare. Trebuie să luptăm din greu pentru cele mai simple standarde de trai. Dacă ești alb, acesta este un oraș minunat, dacă ești negru, este o luptă în fiecare zi.",
            "Deși Minneapolis este un oraș progresiv, iar mulți locuitori albi denunță injustițiile rasiale, populația de culoare subliniază că simplul discurs nu este suficient pentru rezolvarea problemelor.",
            "Timp de mai mulți ani, susținătorii drepturilor angajaților au încercat să convingă orașul să fixeze o limită a salariului minim la 15 dolari pe oră – scop pe care l-au atins în cele din urmă în 2017, dar numai după ce au învins opoziția viguroasă a afaceriștilor locali.",
            "Chiar întâlnirea dintre George Floyd, victima, și Derek Chauvin, polițistul care s-a așezat cu genunchiul pe gâtul acestuia, este o ilustrare a acestor inegalități.",
            "Floyd a crescut într-un cartier segregat al orașului Houston, înainte de a se muta la Minneapolis, acum câțiva ani. Chauvin deține două case în comunități predominant albe, una în suburbiile orașului Minneapolis, alta în Windemere, Florida.",
            "”Este o metaforă pentru acest oraș segregat ”, spune Myron Orfield, profesor de drepturi civile la Universitatea Minnesota.",
            "Iar segregarea în școli crește în Minneapolis mai repede decât în multe alte locuri din SUA.",
            "În anul 2000, în zona metropolitană formată de orașele Minneapolis și Saint Paul, capitala statului Minnesota, erau 11 școli segregate, cu elevi de culoare într-o proporție de cel puțin 90%. În 2019, numărul școlilor de acest gen crescuse la 170, spune Myron Orfield.",
            "Poate unul dintre cele mai izbitoare exemple de inegalități rasiale este cel vizibil chiar în intersecția unde George Floyd a murit – East 38th Street și Chicago Avenue South, care este o barieră în fața populației de culoare.",
            "Zeci de case construite acum un secol în acea zonă aveau contracte care îi împiedicau în mod explicit pe afro-americani să le cumpere sau să le închirieze.",
            "”Casele nu vor fi vândute, închiriate sau ocupate de alte persoane decât membri ai rasei caucaziene”, suna precizarea din contractul imobilelor, potrivit publicației locale Minnpost.",
            "Aceste restricții, valabile și pentru multe alte case din tot orașul, au fost în cele din urmă invalidate de tribunale. Dar până când acest lucru s-a întâmplat, distanțarea dintre albi și populația de culoare era deja uriașă.",
            "Multe dintre cartierele unde au fost construite case cu astfel de restricții sunt și acum zone cu populație majoritar albă. Iar puținele enclave unde s-au putut stabili afro-americanii, incvlusiv cea în care locuia Floyd, luptă acum cu gentrificarea.",
            "Joi, chiar primarul orașului, Jacob Frey, a încercat să pună în context revoltele din oraș, spunând că ce se întâmplă acum reflectă furia comunității de culoare după 400 de ani de inegalitate.",
            "”Ceea ce am văzut în ultimele două zile este rezultatul unei dureri și unei tristeți acumulate. Furia și tristețea sunt înrădăcinate în comunitatea noastră de culoare de 400 de ani, nu doar din cauza a cinci minute de oroare”, a spus primarul, cu referire la cele patru secole împlinite de la momentul în care primii sclavi africani au fost aduși, în captivitate, în America.",

În ”Aida” de Verdi, jucată recent la Paris, pe o mare scenă europeană, chipurile sclavilor etiopieni n-au mai fost înnegrite: e socotit un afront rasist. Deşi afrontul nu e de la Verdi, ci e de la natură: etiopienii s-au născut aşa.\n\n",

Ea a fost compusă pentru inaugurarea acestui teatru, numit ”Opera Khedival” şi   prezentată în cadrul festivităţilor legate de încheierea lucrărilor la Canalul Suez. Astăzi, prin prisma ”corectitudinii politice”, ”Aida” a fost pusă la zid şi lapidată: e o operă care preamăreşte   colonialismul şi ”sexismul”. E ultima găselniţă a importului de neomarxism de peste Ocean. Se pare că acum pericolul nu mai vine de la Răsărit: revoluţia bolşevică se numeşte Black Live Matter şi   pe Lenin îl cheamă George Floyd.",
            "Vezi mai multe articole din categoria editorialistii",
            "În ”Aida”, pe o muzică tulburătoare, o capodoperă şi un triumf de la prima sa reprezentare, Verdi a imaginat o dramă romantică. Radames, un comandant al oştilor egiptene, o iubeşte în taină pe   Aida, o sclavă etiopiană de la curtea faraonului, fiica regelui care se răsculase şi pornise în război împotriva Egiptului. Ambiţiosul şi îndrăgostitul Radames este numit comandant al oştilor   egiptene şi trimis să-l înfrunte, iar Aida rămîne să se frămînte, între dragostea faţă de Radames şi aceea faţă de tatăl şi patria ei. Întors victorios, Radames primeşte onoarea de a o lua de soţie   pe Amneris, fiica faraonului şi, în pragul nunţii, îi destăinuie Aidei planurile de invadare a Etiopiei, cît şi dragostea sa. Învinuit de trădare, preferă să accepte să fie îngropat de viu în   altarul marelui zeu, decît să o uite pe Aida, cum îi cere fiica faraonului, pentru a-l salva. Între timp, sub altar, se strecurase şi Aida, pentru a muri alături de Radames.",
            "Ei bine, această dramă romantică a devenit cu totul altceva. De cîtăva vreme deja, sclavii etiopieni din operă nu mai au feţele negre. Acum, la punerea în scenă a operei ”Aida” la Opéra   Bastille din Paris, lucrurile au mers mult mai departe, pentru că opera traduce în mod explicit opinia regizoarei olandeze Lotte de Beer, care priveşte opera lui Verdi drept una ”colonialistă”   şi ”rasistă”. Dar, ce s-a întîmplat acum în ”Aida”? Avînd în vedere, potrivit lui de Beer, că ”Aida” e o expresie a rasismului şi sexismului şi o ”istorie colonială făcută în vremuri când   arta din Egipt a fost jefuită pentru a fi expusă în muzeele europene”, pusă pe ”o muzică pompoasă şi kitsch”.",
            "Ca urmare, acţiunea întregii opere e scoasă din contextul ei iniţial şi se petrece într-un muzeu unde sînt găzduite capodoperele furate de europeni de la popoarele colonizate. Pentru a pune în   scenă epicul operei, regizoarea a apelat la ”tablouri vivante”, ca o metaforă a colonialismului secolului XIX. Personajele poartă costume din secolul al XIX-lea, însuşi Radamès fiind un ofiţer de   armată al celui de-al doilea imperiu francez. Peste tot, pe parcursul operei,sînt ridiculizaţi colonialiştii europeni, iar aceste ”tablouri vii” sînt şi ele, în sine, privite drept ”fosilele   artei occidentale din secolul al XIX-lea: aroganţă îngheţată”.",
            "Lotte de Beer, adeptă fanatică a corectitudinii politice va ocupa, din 2022, direcţia Operei vieneze. Deci, ne aşteaptă lucruri noi. Ea a afirmat deja că ”Aida” e pe ”lista neagră” pentru că   ea ”anulează cultura”, în sensul ei ”corect politic”, dar nu o va ştege, totuşi, din repertoriu. Încă. Probabil că va fi într-atît de răstălmăcită, încîtRadames va deveni Geoge Floyd, iar   faraonul şi marele preot care-l osîndesc vor purta costume de poliţişti americani.",
            "Noul director al Operei din Paris, Alexander Neef, a anunţat şi el înfiinţarea în cadrul acesteia a unui ”birou al diversităţii”, condus de sengalezul Pap Ndiaye şi, ca urmare a analizei acestui   birou,”unele opere vor dispărea din repertoriu”, iar altele vor fi ”corectate politic” şi rescrise în noua paradigmă a canoanelor impuse de ”lupta cu stereotipurile” de gen şi rasă. Capodopera lui   Verdi a ajuns deja de rîs, urmează şi altele. Cu siguranţă, Othello. Acolo să vedeţi teme de denunţat şi de îndreptat!",
            "În alt plan, cel general, al vieţii noastre, să ne pregătim de efectele corectitudinii politice, acest”covid” spiritual care ne pune botniţă, ale neomarxismului şi al marşului lor către   totalitarism, în numele libertăţii. În fond, şi regimul comunist ne-a spus că ne eliberează, atunci cînd ne-a robit."

            "Vom discuta în continuare despre cât de fals şi de ipocrit joacă democraţii (şi odată cu ei adepţii liberalismului la nivel global), schimbând din mers axiome care au stat la baza progresului şi a   civilizaţiei occidentale.

Principii despre obţinerea succesului   exclusiv pe criterii de competenţă, fără vreo legătură cu apartenenţa la un grup minoritar. Nu degeaba numeroşi comentatori se tem, pe bună dreptate, că în curând am putea trăi sub dictatura   minorităţilor, într-o formă sau alta.",
            "Vezi mai multe articole din categoria editorialistii",
            "Încă din timpul campaniei electorale, Joe Biden s-a angajat să propună Congresului cel mai divers Cabinet din istoria Statelor Unite. Evident, nu atât de dragul diversităţii cu orice preţ, cât mai   ales de dragul voturilor. Mesajul democraţilor pentru cetăţenii americani a fost şi continuă să rămână unul foarte transparent: în politica de nivel înalt (dar nu numai) a devenit un mare handicap   să fii alb şi heterosexual, fără probleme de identitate de gen. Adică, în mod paradoxal, să fii ca Joe Biden.",
            "Ca să echilibreze balanţa în cadrul cabinetului său, noul preşedinte de la Casa Albă s-a străduit să-şi aleagă colaboratori atât de ”exotici”, încât n-ar fi fost chiar o mare surpriză să vedem şi   un secretar de stat pitic (în chip de variantă contemporană a lui Tyrion Lannister, din Urzeala tronurilor). Sau, de ce nu, un ministru ales din minoritatea cetăţenilor cu şase degete la o singură   mână.",
            "Dincolo de aspectul de-a dreptul comic, tinerii americani vor înţelege un singur lucru: în afară de competenţele strict profesionale, dobândite cu trudă pe parcursul întregii vieţi, ai nevoie de un   element esenţial ca să răzbeşti în politica de nivel înalt. Şi nu doar acolo. Inclusiv în cadrul corporaţiilor, a multinaţionalelor din Silicon Valley, dar şi a instituţiilor de stat, fie că vorbim   despre agenţii guvernamentale, primării, tribunale, FBI, CIA, instituţii financiare ş.a.m.d. Nu va fi suficient să-ţi zbârnâie mintea, să fii înzestrat cu toate calităţile din lume, să ai diplomă   de Harvard, Oxford sau Yale. Îţi va trebui ”ceva” în plus. O altă culoare a pielii. Un alt organ de reproducere. Alt arbore genealogic, cu strămoşi născuţi în ţări cât mai îndepărtate. Altă religie   sau măcar o atracţie irezistibilă către persoane de acelaşi sex.",
            "Fără să-i pese câtuşi de puţin de urmările pe termen lung ale acestor discriminări pozitive (căci pe termen scurt am văzut protestele BLM şi Antifa), preşedintele Biden şi-a ţinut promisiunea şi a   reuşit să schiţeze cel mai divers Cabinet din istoria SUA. Lista lungă este deschisă de Kamala Harris, prima femeie afro-americană cu rădăcini asiatice ajunsă în funcţia de vicepreşedinte. Apoi îl   avem pe generalul în rezervă Lloyd Austin, primul american de culoare propus la cârma Pentagonului, de la Războiul de Independenţă şi până în prezent. Rachel Levine va deveni primul transgender   ministru adjunct al Sănătăţii. \"Rachel va oferi o conducere puternică şi expertiza crucială de care avem nevoie pentru a ghida oamenii în această pandemie, indiferent de unde provin, indiferent de   rasă, religie, orientare sexuală, identitate de gen sau dizabilitate\", a explicat Joe Biden.",
            "La nivelul Cabinetului american se mai disting Deb Haaland, primul amerindian secretar de stat pe probleme interne şi Michael Reagan, primul afro-american în fruntea Agenţiei Naţionale pentru   Protecţia Mediului. Un alt afro-american, Susan Rice, va conduce Consiliul de Politică Internă de la Casa Albă. Revelaţia alegerilor preliminare din cadrul Partidului Democrat, Pete Buttigieg, va   fi primul homosexual ajuns în fotoliul de secretar al Transporturilor. Janet Yellen va fi prima femeie în fruntea Ministerului de Finanţe, iar  Alejandro Mayorkas, un imigrant din Cuba, va   prelua conducerea Ministerului pentru Securitate Naţională.",
            "Ar mai fi de remarcat Katherine Tai, cu ambii părinţi născuţi în China, Miguel Cardona, secretarul de la Educaţie cu origini mexicane şi numeroşi alţi membri ai cabinetului din rândul minorităţii   afro-americane şi a reprezentantelor sexului frumos. Şi apropo de femei, merită amintit aici că Joe Biden a fost acuzat de agresiuni sexuale, cel mai recent caz fiind al asistentei parlamentare   Alexandra Reade. Deşi actualul preşedinte şi-a cerut scuze, cu promisiunea că-şi va schimba atitudinea, mass-media a dovedit, încă o dată, toleranţă maximă faţă de Biden, spre deosebire de acuzaţii   similare (dar nedovedite) aduse împotriva lui Trump.",
            "Fără doar şi poate, Joe Biden a găsit cei mai competenţi colaboratori. Dar şi mai evident este că nu a contat doar competenţa în alegerea finală. Au contat în mod special nişte criterii desprinse   parcă dintr-o altă lume, dintr-o altă epocă. Una de tristă amintire, în special în Europa de Est.",
            "Asaltul corectitudinii politice are darul de a-i scoate din sărite pe numeroşi americani. Mulţi dintre ei tocmai de aceea au votat cu Donald Trump. Au votat la fel şi cei care condamnă mişcările   Cancel Culture sau BLM. Condamnă vandalizarea statuilor, cenzurarea operelor literare şi cinematografice, interzicerea scriitorilor şi artiştilor perimaţi, de talia lui William Shakespeare sau Mark   Twain. Condamnă înverşunarea cu care neoliberalii şi progresiştii şterg pe jos cu ideea de familie tradiţională, ridiculizându-i adepţii. Candamnă dictatura de inspiraţie neomarxistă care prin   vocea şefei Camerei Reprezentanţilor, Nancy Pelosi, cere să fie scoase din vocabular cuvinte ca \"mamă\", \"tată\", \"frate\", \"soră\", pentru a nu răni sensibilităţile minorităţilor sexuale.",
            "”Rezistenţa iniţial justificată faţă de rasism, sexism, homofobie, transfobie, xenofobie si alte fobii s-a transformat într-o vânătoare de vrăjitoare: oricine poate fi acuzat, indiferent dacă e sau   nu vinovat. Ideea de diversitate a apărut iniţial în cercurile academice ca să creeze un echilibru, un pod de legătură, să lărgească experienţa studenţilor. Azi are efectul opus: în loc să unească,   divizează!”, afirmă regizorul Andrei Şerban, după o experienţă nefericită ca profesor universitar în ţara tuturor posibilităţilor.",
            "Dacă cineva are vreo clipă senzaţia că ce se întâmplă în America şi la Casa Albă este mult prea departe de noi (şi nu ne priveşte), atunci ar trebui să tragă cu ochiul la administraţia de la   Bruxelles. “În Uniunea noastră nu există loc pentru rasism sau pentru vreo altă formă de discriminare”, a spus preşedintele Comisiei Europene, Ursula von der Leyen, în debutul sesiunii parlamentare   din iunie 2020, în care s-a ţinut un minut de reculegere în memoria afro-americanului George Floyd, victimă a abuzurilor Poliţiei.",
            "Liberalii europeni nu fac decât să îi imite (adeseori prost) pe democraţii americani.",
            "Importul de corectitudine politică din Statele Unite se derulează cu o viteză uluitoare. Ştim cu toţii că şi în România au apărut primele semne: atacuri dure asupra Bisericii şi a familiei   tradiţionale, introducerea în şcoli a educaţiei legate de identitatea de gen, promovarea agresivă a minorităţilor sexuale (vezi panourile publicitare cu ”bisexuala Maria”).",
            "Dacă Joe Biden se gândeşte la o reconciliere între democraţi şi republicani, aşa cum pretinde zgomotos, atunci ”cel mai divers Cabinet din istoria Statelor Unite” este şi cea mai proastă idee din   istoria Statelor Unite. Ea nu va face decât să-i dezbine şi mai mult pe americani. Să sape o groapă şi mai adâncă între diverse minorităţi discriminate pozitiv şi cetăţenii albi, heterosexuali,   duşi la Biserică, sătui până-n gât de ipocrizia corectitudinii politice."

Într-o singură zi Zuckerberg a pierdut 7 miliarde de dolari la bursă după ce zeci de   multinaţionale au preluat din zbor iniţiativa Ligii Antidefăimare şi şi-au retras campaniile de publicitate de pe Facebook, Instagram şi Twitter. Ultima reţea socială a fost băgată cumva la pachet,   nediscriminatoriu, deşi firma lui Jack Dorsey (un simpatizant al democraţilor) a donat 3 milioane de dolari ONG-urilor cu profil antirasism şi s-a remarcat ori de câte ori i-a închis gura lui   Donald Trump, sub falsul pretext al propagării de fake-news-uri. În realitatea preşedintele american îşi exprimase pe Twitter nişte opinii, departe de a fi asimilate informaţiilor false.",
            "”Nu cred că Facebook sau platformele de internet în general ar trebui să fie arbitri ai adevărului. Ar putea fi o linie periculoasă de urmat (…) În general, trebuie să permitem existenţa cât mai   multor voci posibile şi să acordăm un respect special discursului politic”, a subliniat Zuckerberg într-un interviu, la doar trei zile de la moartea afro-americanului George Floyd, drept răspuns la   invitaţia democraţilor de a-l pedepsi pe Donald Trump.",
            "De atunci lucrurile s-au precipitat. Au urmat proteste de stradă violente, vandalizări ale statuilor şi magazinelor, sute de arestări. În Congres democraţii au îngenunchiat şi şi-au cerut scuze   afro-americanilor pentru o pseudo-culpă comună a albilor stăpâni (sau nu) de sclavi. Mai nou, aproape o treime dintre marile companii ale lumii şi-ar putea retrage publicitatea de pe Facebook în   cadrul mişcării #StopHateForProfit. Ironic, nu-i aşa, dat fiind că multinaţionalele sunt văzute ca noii stăpâni de sclavi (iar Starbucks, spre exemplu, îi foloseşte la propriu pe plantaţiile de   cafea). Inclusiv angajaţii lui Zuckerberg au protestat vehement pentru ca miliardarul să cenzureze postările considerate antirasiste (şi, prin extensie, pe cele ale lui Trump) după modelul reţelei   Twitter.",
            "E greu de apreciat dacă Mark Zuckerberg va rezista presiunii. Pe umerii săi apasă o responsabilitate enormă. Pe de o parte există interesul evident al politicienilor de a controla mesajele   considerate înşelătoare, iar pe de altă parte reţeaua Facebook riscă să-şi piardă credibilitatea. A lăsa la aprecierea unor indivizi (subiectivi prin definiţie) să decidă ceea ce este sau nu   cenzurabil atunci când lucrurile sunt departe de a fi înşelătoare sau ofensatoare sună mai degrabă a ”regim Beijing”. Sună a totalitarism, a dictatură.",
            "Pe de altă parte observăm că preocuparea democraţilor americani pentru eliminarea opiniilor adversarilor politici a traversat iute oceanul, devenind o prioritate a Comisiei Europene. ”Avem nevoie   de o societate rezilientă şi critică pentru a lupta împotriva dezinformării. Trebuie să sprijinim mass-media libere şi independente, verificatorii veridicităţii informaţiilor şi cercetătorii”, a   precizat vicepreşedinta CE pentru valori şi transparenţă, Vera Jourova, odată cu lansarea programului european de 9 milioane de euro destinat înfiinţării centrelor naţionale de verificare a   veridicităţii informaţiilor. Cu alte cuvinte, la Bucureşti va apărea Biroul European Anti-Fake-News, un soi de poliţie politică a reţelelor sociale şi instituţiilor mass-media. Foştii securişti   probabil jubilează. Revin vremurile bune nu demult apuse.",
            "Dacă funcţionarii plătiţi de Bruxelles vor considera fake-news-uri postări similare cu cele ale lui Trump de pe reţeaua Twitter, atunci vom avea de-a face nu cu o îndreptăţită luptă împotriva   dezinformării, ci cu o evidentă răfuială cu adversarii politici.",
            "Cât despre Facebook, Trump şi războiul declanşat de democraţi, miza conflictului pe termen lung depăşeşte cu mult orice pretext aruncat în ochii opiniei publice. Globaliştii nu-şi pot permite încă   patru ani cu frâna trasă şi perspectiva unor deraieri, iar pentru asta sunt pregătiţi să calce pe cadavre mai ceva ca regele Leopold al II-lea în colonia sa africană.",

            "Criza pandemiei, creşterea ratei şomajului, protestele din Statele Unite şi fluctuaţiile majore de pe pieţele financiare au creat cea mai tumultoasă perioadă din istoria recentă, comentează   cotidianul The Wall Street Journal.",
            "Până în prezent, pandemia s-a soldat cu peste 120.000 de morţi în Statele Unite, generând pierderi economice imense şi împingând sistemul financiar spre colaps. Perioada de creştere a indicilor   bursieri s-a încheiat brusc, înainte de a apărea în mod dramatic unele creşteri. În oraşele din SUA a izbucnit o mişcare masivă de mitinguri în favoarea dreptăţii sociale, influenţând comunitatea   de afaceri. Managerii companiilor şi investitorii încă încearcă să înţeleagă ce s-a întâmplat în prima jumătate a anului 2020 şi să stabilească direcţia de aici înainte.",
            "Vezi mai multe articole din categoria externe",
            "Prima jumătate a anului 2020 a fost cea mai agitată perioadă de tranzacţionare la care au asistat investitorii în perioada modernă. Indicii bursieri, valoarea produselor de bază şi a obligaţiunilor   au scăzut semnificativ, în contextul unei boli misterioase din centrul Chinei care s-a transformat în pandemie. Cea mai îndelungată perioadă de creştere a valorii indicilor bursieri a avut un final   brusc, fără a fi cauzată de vreo eroare a unei bănci centrale sau de un război comercial, ci de efectele economice cauzate de Covid-19. La un moment dat, părea că sistemul financiar era în pragul   colapsului, notează publicaţia The Wall Street Journal într-un articol intitulat: \"Şase luni care au zdruncinat lumea / Pandemia, şomajul de amploare, protestele la nivel naţional şi fluctuaţiile   majore de pe pieţele financiare au creat cea mai tumultoasă perioadă din memoria recentă\".",
            "După ani de tăcere, mulţi manageri de culoare au început să îşi împărtăşească experienţele de tip rasist. De la uciderea afro-americanului George Floyd şi de când protestele au generat o dezbatere   privind rasele şi societatea, mulţi oameni de afaceri de culoare simt că a venit vremea să vorbească despre interacţiunile dificile, uneori traumatizante pe care le au în afara sferei profesionale.",
            "\"Pentru managerii de companii, au crescut presiunile de a trece de la vorbe la fapte în privinţa inegalităţilor. Indiferent de problemă, accelerarea schimbărilor sociale este din ce în ce mai mult   pe agenda directorilor de companii\", subliniază WSJ.",
            "O altă problemă identificată de Wall Street Journal este reducerea varietăţii de produse aflate pe piaţă. În ultimele decenii, companiile orientate în funcţie de pretenţiile publicului au încercat   să mulţumească aproape pe toată lumea. Pandemia a făcut imposibil acest lucru, astfel că unele companii nu mai încearcă să facă acest lucru. Producătorii de cartofi, maşini, alimente au redus   ofertele de când pandemia a afectat reţelele de aprovizionare, iar clienţii au revenit la branduri familiare.",
            "Unii directori de companii au explicat ce au avut de învăţat în privinţa gestionării crizelor, comunicării cu angajaţii, desfăşurării activităţilor de acasă şi comunicării prin Zoom.",
            "\"În această perioadă ambiguă, trebuie să fii deschis să înveţi. Pentru că dacă nu înveţi, nu ştii cum să te adaptezi... A fi transparent, a fi interesat sunt ingrediente bune. Un lucru despre care   vorbim este oboseala mentală. Eu consider creierul un muşchi. Îndemn oamenii să ia o pauză, să aibă o oră de masă, să se detaşeze puţin\", afirmă Ann Mukherjee, preşedintele şi directorul companiei   Pernod Ricard North America.",
            "\"Nu mai există ceva de genul prea multă comunicare... Pentru mine, important este să te văd, pentru tine, să mă vezi, să vedem că suntem bine şi că avem activităţi\", subliniază Christopher   Reynolds, director administrativ al filialei nord-americane a companiei Toyota."

            "Şi o vor face, pentru că autorităţile sînt paralizate în faţa lor. Ei sînt ”Omul nou” american, care are în genere o educaţie superioară ”de stînga”, nu mai acceptă şi nu mai împărtăşeşte nicio   idee a părinţilor, pe care-i contestă şi le neagă orice realizare, iar pentru el ”visul american” e o minciună care a fost spulberată de profesorii neomarxişti radicali de la colegiu. A crezut şi   şi-a însuşit toate sentinţele lor şi a devenit intolerant, ca şi ideologia în care a ajuns să creadă, neavînd habar însă de istoria şi eşecul atît de dramatic şi de sîngeros al marxismului din   Europa. Sau dacă acestea se aduc în discuţie, vorbeşte despre ”accidente” şi ”comploturi imperialiste”, care au săpat şi distrus temeliile socialismului. ”Omul nou” american a devenit incapabil de   dialog şi stigmatizează cu o mare uşurinţă pe cei care nu sînt în accord cu el, ori nu fac parte din acelaşi ”grup select” de discuţii. Restul sînt conservatori rasişti, misogini, mizantropi,   xenofobi, sexişti etc., cu care e nedemn să te amesteci, pentru că fac parte din categoria profund incriminată de persoane ”incorecte politic”. Şi, mai nou, nu există pedeapsă prea mare pentru o   asemenea vină.",
            "”Omul nou” al mileniului, atît de visat şi clamat de propaganda comunistă, din China pînă-n RDG şi din URSS pînă-n Angola în anii ’80 s-a născut, în sfîrşit. În America. El distruge statui cu   frenezie, ca un început al unei profunde ”revoluţii culturale” neomarxiste, mascate de pretextul înlăturării ”simbolurilor sclaviei”. Îi vine uşor să o facă: a învăţat în şcoală că aşa e corect şi   că, de fapt, lumea în care trăieşte este fundamentată pe falsuri şi minciuni, pe idoli care au fost de fapt criminali. La fel de răi ca naziştii. Doctorul de origine română Martin S. Martin, un bun   cunoscător al sistemului educaţional din Statele Unite remarca recent, într-un interviu, ”atitudinea anti-americană instalată în minţile lor de profesorii neomarxişti din colegii şi universităti”.   În şcolile de stat, demult ”nu se mai recită în fiecare dimineaţă, cum era regula, jurămîntul de loialitate pentru Statele Unite. Sînt mai multe pagini în noile manuale în care este criticat   genocidul american împotriva indienilor şi sclavia, decît cele care descriu meritele pionierilor, exploratorilor, inventatorilor, Părinţilor Fondatori, marilor industriaşi, eroilor naţionali.   Thomas Jefferson şi George Washington sînt criticaţi, fiindcă au fost proprietari de sclavi, nu lăudaţi pentru ceea ce au făcut, pentru prima dată în istoria lumii”. Profesorii de liceu care nu   sînt cu adevarat ”convinşi de superioritatea ideilor de stînga”, spune Martin, mimează măcar, pentru a fi în ton cu lumea, această aderenţă la ele şi, în genere, ”e mai de bon ton să fii   anti-american decît patriot, să fii de stînga, decît conservator”.",
            "”Omul nou” american are la îndemînă internetul, o armă pe care o mînuieşte cu măiestrie şi care îi oferă un ”cîmp tactic” imens, în care grupuri mici pot mobiliza cu success şi rapid mulţimi de   oameni, în sprijinul unei acţiuni care în urmă cu două-trei decenii ar fi părut o blasfemie îngrozitoare, dar care acum e ”mainstream”. Acestor tineri ”mileniali”, neomarxişti furioşi, li se   alătură, spune Martin, şi un alt tip de ”om nou” american, mai bine spus ”noul prost” american, cu o pregătire mediocră, cu o mentalitate de asistat, nemulţumit de tot şi de toate, dar care tocmai   de aceea răspunde imediat şi cu un entuziasm violent cînd e să ”dărîme” lumea veche de care e nemulţumit, pentru a face loc celei noi, care-i promite totul pe tavă. Între cele două mari categorii   de mai sus, se află activiştii de profesie, ai tuturor cauzelor posibilie – de la ecologişti radicali, la gay-pride şi feministe.",
            "Ei, aceşti ”oameni noi” americani sînt cei care au dărîmat statuia lui George Washington din Portland. Dar nu numai pe aceasta. În războiul cu statuile au căzut şi Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart sau   Leonardo Da Vinci, Mahatma Gandhi, sau, cu totul inexplicabil şi fără motiv (altul decît cel care vizează extinderea acestui război spre înseşi fundamentele democraţiei americane), bustul lui   Abraham Lincoln, cel care a realizat eliberarea negrilor din sclavie: acestuia, după ce a fost vandalizat, i s-a dat foc la Chicago. Autorităţile nu intervin, pentru că n-ar fi ”corect politic” să   o facă. Dimpotrivă, virsul distrugător a intrat în Congres, unde s-a cerut desfiinţarea muzeelor naţionale Jefferson şi Washington, Părinţii Fondatori, pe motiv că ”au avut sclavi”. Vestita Nancy   Pelosy s-a alăturat cu inconştienţă ”mainstream”-ului distrugător, cerînd ca 11 statui să fie înlăturate din Capitoliu, pe acelaşi motiv. Dacă republicanii vor pierde alegerile şi le vor cîştiga   democraţii, permisivi şi apropiaţi de mişcările radicale, care şi-au extins şi ei lupta de la corectitudinea politică la dărîmarea statuilor, în anul 2021 de ”visul american” se  va alege   praful. El va fi înlocuit cu o dictatură vindicativă a străzii, care va impune noi valori, reguli, norme şi principii de convieţuire, pe care guvernul federal nu va face decît să le legifereze,   pentru că aşa e ”corect politic”.",
            "Furia a trecut şi oceanul: în Belgia, au fost profanate şi se cere îndepărtarea statuilor lui Leopold al II-lea, regele care a anexat ”şi a exploatat” Congo-ul din inima Africii. Noi, slavă lui   Dumnezeu, sper că sîntem departe de toată această nebunie, care e greu de imaginat că ne-ar putea cuprinde: nu văd pe nimeni în stare în România, deocamdată, să dărîme statuia lui Mihai Viteazul de   la Universitate, pentru că a avut robi ţigani. Încă. Deşi, nu ştim ce ”ordin pe unitate” vor primi campionii ”corectitudinii politice” de pe meleagurile noastre.",
            "În Statele Unite, Marea Britanie şi Europa occidentală, toate aceste acţiuni sînt pornite de grupuri care acţionează şi se mobilizează pe facebook. De pildă, cei ce au dărîmat statuia lui George   Washington în Portland fac parte din două grupuri: unul, ”Rose City Justice” se defineşte pe pagina sa de facebook ca fiind dedicat ”sensibilizării oamenilor şi reformării sistemelor care au fost   aplicate pentru a discrimina comunitatea neagră”. E un grup privat (poţi vizualiza postări sau primi mesajele lor numai dacă eşti admis în grup), a fost  fondat pe 5 iunie de trei   administratori, şi ei anonimi şi are deja 3.383 membri. Al doilea, ”Lavender Caucus” e o mişcare de  lesbiene, gay, bisexuali, transgender, intersex & questioning, care îşi propune să   stabilească ”legături mai bune cu mişcarea muncitorească”. Acest grup LGBTQ au şi o ”declaraţie de misiune” pe pagina lor de facebook:  ”misiunea noastră e de a îmbunătăţi viaţa oamenilor care   lucrează şi a familiilor lor şi de a realiza o mai mare justiţie socială şi economică. Credem şi vom lupta pentru o societate dreaptă”.  Cele două grupuri care visează ”o lume mai bună” (pe   care noi am şi cunoscut-o şi de care abia am scăpat în 1989) au organizat mai întîi o  dezbatere la Jefferson High School, unde şi-au împărtăşit experienţele proprii cu privire la rasism şi   discriminare, apoi, la lăsarea serii, s-au adunat la statuia de bronz a lui Washington. Mai întîi, au înfăşurat capul monumentului într-un steag american şi au dat foc steagului, spre bucuria din   mormînt a lui Ossama Bin Laden. Noaptea, au dărmînat-o.",
            "America a intrat într-o fază gravă de ”tulburare bipolară”, o boală psihică destul de serioasă. De la faza de depresie, a trecut acum la faza de dispoziţie crescută, iar aceasta este considerabilă,   transformată de-a dreptul într-o manie distrugătoare, cînd ”individul se comportă sau se simte anormal de energetic, fericit sau iritabil”, cînd ”indivizii adesea iau decizii nu prea gîndite, fără   a lua prea mult în seamă consecinţele”. Aşa e definită această boală psihică maniacală, de care a fost atinsă ”cea mai solidă democraţie”. În multe cazuri, consecinţa finală a tulburării bipolare,   acută şi netratată la un pacient este suicidul."

            "\"Este destul de uşor să sintetizăm poziţia politică a preşedintelui Donald Trump: efortul său de obţinere a unui nou mandat este marcat de probleme grave. Este cu 8,1% în urma politicianului   democrat Joe Biden în media sondajelor de opinie, potrivit Institutului RealClearPolitics. Este pe locul doi în aproape toate sondajele din cele şase state cele mai importante în modificarea   direcţiei votului. Şomajul, cel mai sensibil dintre indicatorii economici importanţi politic, a crescut rapid din cauza coronavirusului şi va fi în mod sigur la cote istorice în ziua alegerilor. În   ultimele 15 cazuri în care un preşedinte american a candidat pentru un nou mandat, doar trei s-au confruntat cu creşterea ratei şomajului în ulimul an înaintea scrutinului, conform unui studiu   realizat de firma de lobby Mehlman Castagnetti Rosen & Thomas. Şi toţi trei - Herbert Hoover, Jimmy Carter şi George H.W. Bush - au pierdut scrutinul\", explică editorialistul Gerald F. Seib   într-un articol publicat în cotidianul The Wall Street Journal sub titlul \"Trump scrie trei teme în planul de campanie electorală\" / \"Preşedintele speră să întoarcă situaţia electorală problematică   prin prezentarea unei economii în relansare, contracararea Chinei şi poziţionându-se drept candidatul legii şi ordinii\".",

Nu există niciun al treilea candidat important   care să apară pentru a lua voturile anti-Trump de la democraţi aşa cum au făcut candidaţii libertarian şi ecologist în 2016. \"Donald Trump are o bază solidă, dar este o personalitate controversată   şi nu a reuşit extinderea bazei electorale. În mod normal, aceste cifre ar genera perspectiva eşecului. Dar... aceasta nu este o perioadă obişnuită, Trump nu este un politician obişnuit, iar datele   obişnuite s-ar putea să nu se mai aplice în cele patru luni şi jumătate până la alegeri. Preşedintele are avantaje în materie de fonduri şi medii de socializare faţă de Joseph Biden şi un avantaj   în Colegiul Electoral care i-ar putea permite din nou să piardă votul popular şi chiar câteva din statele decisive, dar să câştige totuşi scrutinul\", subliniază editorialistul.",

Va pretinde că în lipsa poziţiei sale dure, China ar fi continuat tendinţa care pe termen lung i-ar fi permis să obţină un avantaj comercial. Abordarea dură a lui Donald Trump   intervine în contextul în care americanii acuză din ce în ce mai mult China că nu a depus suficiente eforturi pentru a opri răspândirea epidemiei de coronavirus.",

Preşedintele SUA a transmis luni prin Twitter: \"Lege şi ordine!\" Este a şaptea oară în două săptămâni când postează   acest mesaj.",

            "Întreaga lume a văzut, de fapt, cum statul comite o crimă (şi nu oricare, ci democraţia americană!). De aici, pare că va porni o revoltă cu impact în întreaga lume. Am văzut cum, în ultima vreme,   se mobilizează cele mai neaşteptate energii, plasate pe diferite fronturi, în conflicte ”asimetrice”, cum le place ”băieţilor” din servicii să spună. În esenţă, pe două mari polarizări politice,   mediatice, virtuale: între ”lumea nouă”, globalistă şi cea a susţinătorilor tradiţiilor lumii vechi, cu ”clişeele” lor, statul-naţiune, familia, Biserica. Dar sînt mult mai multe alte ”fronturi”,   iar acum a venit, cu prospeţime, peste o lume sărăcită, plictistă şi furioasă în urma măsurilor de prevenire din timpul pandemiei de Covid-19 acest nou conflict, care unifică toate disputele   într-una singură: între autoritate şi o armată din ce în ce mai mare de zeloţi, care îmbrăţişează cu fanatism şi, uneori, cu agende ascunse, cauza lui George Floyd.",
            "Vom descoperi în curînd că ”efectul fluturelui” al lui Edward Lorenz are aplicabilităţi neaşteptate. El a arătat că  \"mişcarea aripilor unui fluture azi poate produce o mică schimbare a   atmosferei. Din această cauză şi de-a lungul unei anumite perioade de timp, atmosfera se va schimba. Peste o lună poate, o tornadă care trebuia să lovească coasta Indoneziei nu va mai apărea. Sau   din contră, tocmai din această cauză va apărea”. O aserţiune din teoria haosului este pe cale să devină teorie socială, un principiu cu aplicabilitate largă din meteorologie să funcţioneze şi în   politică, în economie şi în general în evoluţia umanităţii, care mi se pare de o bucată de vreme din ce în ce mai greu predictibilă.",
            "O ”revoluţie portocalie” se manifestă frenetic, deocamdată în spaţiul virtual şi care nu mai cunoaşte niciun fel de oprelişti. E momentul în care internetul a ajuns la maturitate, în care i s-a   înţeles puterea – nocivă şi benefică, în măsuri egale. Problema e că în niciun moment aceste măsuri nu sînt egale în acelaşi timp şi că, devenit dintr-un mijloc de comunicare un mijloc de   mobilizare, internetul poate să provoace nu numai o ”revoluţie portocalie” a acestui început de mileniu, dar şi un incendiu incontrolabil.",
            "Dacă la finele anilor ‘80 asistam la finalul unui lung ”război rece”, marcînd căderea unui sistem politic, social şi economic falimentar şi încă de la începuturile sale şi falit moral, pentru că   era bazat pe miciună şi represiune, aceste mişcări de stradă care apar acum ici şi colo, cu grade diferite de legitimitate, în diferitele colţuri ale lumii, ce pot fi? Au ele un element comun? Cred   că da. Demonstrează că internetul a schimbat faţa lumii şi că ”aripa fluturelui”, strivit pe o stradă într-un colţ al lumii, poate provoca o cădere de guvern într-altul. Arată că nicio dictatură nu   mai e sigură, dar şi că democraţia e departe de a se afla în siguranţă."

            "Presa americană abundă de analize asupra acestui caz, iar interpretările sunt partizane în funcţie de simpatiile politice, unii sunt pro-democraţi, iar ceilalţi sunt de partea republicanilor,   susţinători ai preşedintelui Trump.",
            "Sigur, în cazul dat, implicaţiile sunt determinate de amploarea evenimentelor care au avut ca scânteie moartea lui Floyd.",
            "Vezi mai multe articole din categoria editorialistii",
            "Întrebările încep de la anunţarea rezultatelor autopsiei preliminare, care relevă că nu există semne de asfixie mecanică ori de strangulare, dar că Floyd avea serioase probleme coronariene şi   hipertensiune. De asemenea, se pare că raportul toxicologic ar releva existenţa unor substanţe interzise în corpul victimei.",
            "În ceea ce priveşte imobilizarea propriu-zisă a lui Floyd, e de subliniat că acesta a fost extras din autoturismul în care se afla, a fost încătuşat şi s-a opus a fi urcat în maşina poliţiei, pe   motivul claustrofobiei. Păi, în propria maşină nu avea nici o teamă în sensul ăsta.",
            "Acum însă, vine treaba cea mai inexplicabilă. Deşi Floyd e încătuşat şi trântit la pământ, practic inofensiv, agenţii continuă să-l ţină în poziţia asta, iar Chauvin îl apasă continuu cu genunchiul   pe gât. Atenţie, timp de 8 minute şi 46 secunde !",
            "M-am uitat de câteva ori la clipul respectiv şi mi se pare deja clar că agenţii aşteptau ceva, dar ce ? În plus, nu aveau nici o problemă a se lăsa filmaţi în timp ce practic, provocau moartea   nefericitului. Oare, de ce ? Erau complet lipsiţi de orice urmă de precauţie ? Iarăşi, de ce ?",
            "Procurorul General William Barr a declarat că tulburările grave care au urmat şi care s-au răspândit cu repeziciune în toată ţara, ”sunt planificate, organizate şi conduse de grupuri extremiste de   stânga, care folosesc tactici de tip Antifa”.",

În acest scop, foloseşte tactici variate, inclusiv activismul digital, distrugeri, violenţă fizică şi hărţuire a persoanelor pe care ei îi identifică şi îi categorisesc ca fiind fascişti,   rasişti sau de stânga. Subliniez, EI îi identifică ! Parcă, recunoaştem câte ceva din aceste tactici...",

(…) Practic, orice candidat la   preşedinţie din SUA, fie că a învins sau a mâncat bătaie, toţi s-au referit la nevoia de a repara o ţară divizată. Bill Clinton care a ajuns preşedinte în anul 1992 după afacerea Rodney King,   vorbea pe larg despre acest lucru. Spunea că dacă noi nu reuşim să ne înţelegem unul cu altul, toate teoriile şi programele politice dispar. America este o ţară divizată care o dată cu sosirea la   putere a lui Trump s-a divizat şi mai tare. Eu nu sunt dintre cei care spun Trump este de vină. Trump are partea lui de vină, numai că există o realitate americană pe care ei nu au reuşit s-o   rezolve. Ea conţine în interiorul ei elemente care se numesc: rasism, discriminare, tratarea inegală a cetăţenilor, inclusiv revolta împotriva acestor fenomene.”",

Afirmaţia pe care a făcut-o acum o zi dacă nu mă înşel că rolul lui este să apere   cetăţeanul Statelor Unite şi proprietatea lui s-ar putea să devină mai legitimă decât chemarea furioasă şi corectă a minorităţii negre şi a celorlalţi care au fost şocaţi de gestul poliţistului   care l-a sufocat să fie mai legitimă această apărare a proprietăţii.”",

Din nefericire, „deep state”, inclusiv în România discuţiile despre Statul Paralel, au o dimensiune   de realitate incontestabilă pe care niciun om întreg la cap nu le poate ignora şi o dimensiune ficţională- conspirativă care de multe ori omoară seriozitatea primei dezbateri. În acest moment, mie   îmi este greu să spun cât anume din ce se întâmplă în SUA este deep state si cât anume este realitate, fiindcă genunchiul pe gâtul omului ăla l-am văzut cu toţii.

(…) Şi în SUA la fel. Publicaţiile americane introduc această informaţiile despre grupurile Antifa şi altele celebre care sunt sponsorizate direct sau prin intermediari   de organizaţiile lui George Soros. Nu am cum să neg sau să spun există sau nu există un complot, fiindcă nu am informaţii şi nu îmi place să vorbesc de pomană, dar spun un lucru: dacă nu există   substanţă degeaba finanţezi! Dar substanţa există din nefericire”.",

Venind o calamitate de genul aceste, având în faţă   imaginea Chinei şi imaginea Italiei care este clar că au influenţat foarte rău cetăţenii români, este clar că cetăţeanul roman şi-a căutat siguranţa şi s-a adăpostit la umbra statului. Aşa se   explică faptul că în prima perioadă, atât PNL-ul, cât şi Guvernul au avut un scor de susţinere mare pentru că cetăţeanul s-a simţit apărat de ei. Faptul că acum ne este uşor să uităm ziua de 1   Martie 2020 când vedeam sutele de cazuri din Italia, este ok, omenirea uită. Dar, de 1 martie lumea a fost speriată.”, încheie analistul politic."

În Statele Unite a fost   deajuns să fie vizibil modul în care decurge de fapt o arestare (căci moartea lui George Floyd a fost un vîrf al aisbergului atotputerniciei poliţieneşti din SUA), pentru a se vedea că degeaba   acelor oameni li se spune politicos şi deferent ”afroamericani”, pentru că ei tot ca ”negri” sînt trataţi. Din nefericire, partea violentă a protestelor izbucnite după moartea lui Floyd arată că,   tot aşa, unii dintre ei nu mai văd motivul pentru care să facă un efort de a se purta altfel, de cum sînt percepuţi de un Derek Chauvin.",
            "Ceea ce dezvăluie criza din Statele Unite este simptomatic şi îngrijorător: se vede fragilitatea structurilor statului emblematic pentru democraţie, în condiţiile în care etichetele nu fac decît să   spoiască o realitate cu totul diferită. Nu e deajuns să spui că faci ”America din nou puternică”, atîta vreme cît protecţia socială şi asistenţa medicală se dovedesc nişte forme fără fond, cînd un   virus arată nu numai vulnerabilitatea unor spitale, ci una simptomatică pentru sistem, în întregul său. Semnalul de alarmă a fost tras încă de atunci, iar decizia lui Donald Trump de a scoate   armata pe străzi împotriva unui ”terorism intern” în urma manifestaţiilor violente din ultimele zile, oricare ar fi acesta, arată falimentul generalizat al politicilor publice. Dacă nu era crima   poliţistului Derek Chauvin, apărea cu siguranţă altceva care să arate cît de mari sînt faliile care dezbină cultura societală americană. Şi în America, ”Chauvin”, împrumutat din franceză este   rădăcina aceluiaşi termen, cu acelaşi sens ca la noi: pentru ”chauvinist”, ”şovinist”, cuvintele asociate sînt în dicţionarul englezei americane ”naţionalist”, ”xenofob”, ”bigot”, ”misogin”.",

Cei din urmă proclamă libertarianismul, dar nu şi-ar împărţi profiturile cu săracii, pentru că nu mai cred în valoarea creştină a iubirii aproapelui. Au înlocuit-o   cu ”toleranţa”, un termen care îi aşează aprioric deasupra celui tolerat, pe o poziţie de putere binevoitoare. În mod paradoxal, politicile lui Barak Obama şi ale democraţilor au accentuat   diferenţele, pentru că în comunităţile tradiţionale de tip ”sudist”, ariile ”corectitudinilor politice” de tot felul au creat o stare de alertă, sentimentul unui asediu îndreptat împotriva   valorilor în care grupurile de americani conservatori/tradiţionalişti cred în continuare cu tărie. Dealtfel, din ”cultura toleranţei”, care a născut un tip nou de intoleranţă faţă de tradiţii, s-a   născut şi o anomalie.

Asemenea la noi, în România, nicio afirmaţie, oricît de insalubră ar fi ea la adresa credincioşilor Bisericii creştine, ea nu va face vreodată obiectul   auto-sesizării Consiliului Naţional pentru Combaterea Discriminării.",

Indiferent de partea cui se află dreptatea   şi adevărul, de partea cretanului sau a aşa-numiţilor mincinoşi, toţi, din ambele părţi, au de pierdut.

Semnul egal între aceste două variante de opţiune ale prezentului şi viitorului îl face brutalitatea, fie că este a   manifestanţilor violenţi, fie că este a forţelor poliţieneşti şi ale Gărzii Republicane care se înfruntă pe străzile Statelor Dezbinate ale Americii. Iar brutalitatea nu are nimic de-a face cu   libertatea, ci numai cu dictatura. Binele impus încetează să mai fie bun. E bun numai pentru cel care ajunge pe poziţia de a-l dispune, pentru cel care cucereşte baricada, sparge cordonul de forţă   al celuilalt.",
            "Ceea ce se întîmplă în SUA în aceste zile se manifestă în diferite forme şi grade de intensitate în întreaga lume. Dintr-o confruntare precum cea între China şi manifestanţii din Hong Kong, unde   s-a interzis pentru prima oară în 30 de ani comemorarea masacrelor din Piaţa Tiananmen va cîştiga prima, nu neapărat pentru că ar avea dreptate, ci pentru că e mai puternică. Şi pierde invariabil   libertatea. Libertatea este exact distanţa, clipa între piatra pe care un manifestant se gîndeşte să o arunce spre un scutier şi degetul acestuia, pregătit să apese pe lansatorul de gaze.   Libertatea e momentul sacru şi totodată atît de fragil şi de nepreţuit al istoriei umanităţii, aflat din nou în stare de asediu. Libertatea riscă să moară sufocată din atîta dragoste proclamată   faţă de ea, în spaţiul din ce în ce mai mic rămas între protestatari şi cordoanele de poliţie."

So before the voracious horde of media sensationalism decides to somehow turn it about me, there’s a clear need to       speak about the circumstances: Black Lives Matter. Peace, riots, looting, are an absolutely legitimate form of protest. the media is by nature only going to show the most sensational, which       only proves a long standing racist agenda. I was detained when standing in solidarity, as were many of the final vanguard within Santa Monica. We were given the option to leave, and were       informed that if we did not retreat, we would be arrested. When many did turn to leave, we found another line of police officers blocking our route, at which point, they started zip tying us.       It needs to be stated that as a straight white man, and a public figure, the institutional consequences of my detainment are nothing in comparison to others within the movement. This is       ABSOLUTELY not a narrative about me, and I hope the media doesn’t make it such. This is, and will be, a time about standing ground near others as a situation escalates, providing educated       support, demonstrating and doing the right thing. This is precisely the time to contemplate what it means to stand as an ally. I hope others in my position do as well. I noticed that there are       cameras that roll within the police cruisers during the entirety of our detainment, hope it helps. I’ll speak no more on the subject, as I’m (1) not well versed enough to do so, (2) not the       subject of the movement, and (3) uninterested in drawing attention away from the leaders of the #BLM movement. I will be, again, posting the link in my story to a comprehensive document for       donations and support.",

În timp ce America a fost blocată din cauza pandemiei, o mare parte din ceea ce caracterizează viaţa normală s-a oprit. Problemele mai fundamentale ale   ţării au continuat însă. Rasismul sistemic este unul dintre ele, cu numeroase exemple evidente.",
            "În februarie a apărut un videoclip cu Ahmaud Arbery, un bărbat negru care a fost împuşcat în Georgia în timp ce făcea jogging. În martie, într-un alt video, o femeie din Parcul Central din New York   a făcut un apel fals la 911, acuzând un bărbat de culoare că o ameninţă cu moartea, şi exemplele pot continua. Pe măsură ce zilele de epidemie treceau, numărul deceselor era halucinant mai mare în   rândul negrilor. În acelaşi timp, manifestanţi albi violenţi făceau proteste în centrele marilor oraşe împotriva măsurilor de distanţare socială şi de izolare, poliţia neavând nicio reacţie.",
            "Justiţia din SUA care te condamnă după culoarea pielii",
            "În fapt, dincolo de segregarea socială a populaţiei, rasismul în forma sa structurală este prezent în special în justiţie şi printre cei care ar trebui să vegheze la siguranţa oamenilor. Justiţia   din SUA este rasistă şi asta o arată şi cifrele.",
            "În SUA, persoanele de culoare cuprind 13% din populaţia ţării şi 14% din consumatorii activi de droguri. Cu toate acestea, 37% din persoanele arestate pentru posesie sau vânzare de droguri sunt de   culoare. Afro-americanii sunt arestaţi pentru infracţiuni legate de droguri cu o rată de 2 până la 11 ori mai mare decât faţă de albi.",
            "De asemenea, negrii au de trei ori mai multe şanse să fie opriţi în trafic decât albii. În New York, de exemplu, unde negrii reprezintă mai puţin de jumătate din întreaga populaţie, 80% dintre cei   opriţi de poliţie sunt cei de culoare. Infractorii negri primesc sentinţe cu 10% mai mari decât infractorii albi pentru aceleaşi fape. De asemenea, cu cât pedeapsa este mai mare, cu atât sunt şanse   mai mari ca persoana inculpată să fie de culoare.",
            "Rasismul poliţiştilor poate să fie combătut înainte de a face victime, dar nu se doreşte acest lucru",
            "Până să ajungă în justiţie, populaţia de culoare trebuie să treacă prin cea mai mare luptă - cea a justiţiei de stradă. Drepturile poliţiştilor şi permisivitatea privind uzul armelor de foc, au   curmat nenumărate vieţi în rândul comunităţii afro-americane. Doar că, problema este mai adâncă de atât. Studiile au demonstrat că poliţiştii care ajung să ucidă persoane de culoare, au un trecut   violent şi cu frecvente „derapaje”.  Asemenea deţinuţilor, poliţiştii cu abateri comportamentale şi care au fost implicaţi în altercaţii şi schimburi de focuri de armă, au şanse să recidiveze   în fapte de o gravitate şi mai mare.",
            "Derek Chauvin, fostul ofiţer care a fost acuzat de omor de gradul al treilea pentru uciderea lui Floyd, nu se află nici el la prima sa abatere. În timpul unui razii rutiere din 2006, Chauvin s-a   numărat printre cei şase ofiţeri care, în doar patru secunde, au tras 43 de focuri de armă într-un camion condus de un bărbat care urma să fie interogat cu privire la un caz de furt. Bărbatul a   murit pe loc, iar departamentul de poliţie nu a recunoscut niciodată că ofiţerii au tras fără motiv.",
            "Chauvin este, de asemenea, subiectul a cel puţin 18 plângeri de comportament necorespunzător şi a fost implicat în două schimburi de focuri de armă. Conform The Associated Press, 16 dintre plângeri   au fost „închise fără sancţiuni”, iar în legătură cu celelalte cazuri, s-au emis doar două scrisori de mustrare.",
            "Tou Thao, unul dintre cei trei ofiţeri din Minneapolis care a fost implicat în moartea lui Floyd a fost anchetat într-un proces din 2017 după ce Thao şi un alt ofiţer au oprit un cuplu pe stradă,   fără motiv, i-au încătuşat şi i-au lovit în repetate rânduri, până ce unuia dintre ei i-a fost spart maxilarul. Thao a plătit daune morale, dar nu se ştie dacă departamentul de poliţie i-a aplicat   sancţiuni împotriva comportamentului lui. În întreaga ţară, mai puţin de una din 12 plângeri de conduită necorespunzătoare a poliţiei determină orice fel de acţiuni disciplinare.",
            "George Floyd nu poate să fie adus înapoi, dar până problemele nu se vor rezolva la nivel structural, tot mai multe persoane de culoare vor muri sub bocancul greu al rasismului."

            "\"Am aruncat o privire la cum a fost 2020 şi am încercat să-mi exprim sentimentele despre contextul politic, Black Lives Matter, Covid şi tot ceea ce s-a întâmplat anul acesta\", a spus artistul. \"Prietenii ne mor, noi suntem blocaţi în case, chiar plângem pe pământul făgăduinţei\".",

Anthony Fauci, directorul National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (Institutul Naţional american pentru Alergii şi Boli Infecţioase).",
            "Fogerty i-a amintit şi pe oficialii responsabili de moartea Breonnei Taylor şi a lui George Floyd, şi pe judecătorii care nu au văzut nicio dovadă a infracţiunilor. La un moment dat, muzica se opreşte şi cântăreţul spune: \"Nu pot respira/ I can't breathe\" - cuvintele care au fost reepetate de Floyd în timp ce poliţistul din Minneapolis Derek Chauvin a ţinut genunchiul pe gâtul lui.",
            "Vara trecută, lui John Fogerty i s-a părut ciudat că echipa de campanie a lui Trump a ales să folosească melodia formaţiei Creedence Clearwater Revival \"Fortunate Son\" la mitinguri. John Fogerty, compozitorul piesei, l-a ironizat pe liderul de la Casa Albă explicând că versurile fac referire la copiii celor bogaţi, \"norocoşii\", care nu au fost recrutaţi pentru războiul din Vietnam, aşa cum a fost cazul lui Trump."

Agenţii anchetau cu privire la un trafic de droguri în care era implicatfostul prieten al tinerei. La sosirea poliţiştilor, noul partener al tinerei a deschis focul cu o armă, pe care o deţinea în mod legal. Agenţii au ripostat, iar Breonna Taylor a fost împuşcată cu mai multe gloanţe.",

El i-a criticat la începutul lunii iunie pe colegii săi din Marele Circ pentru că nu iau atitudine faţă de uciderea lui George Floyd. În 21 iunie, britanicul a participat la manifestaţiile de la Londra împotriva rasismului. În plus, Lewis Hamilton a purtat un tricou negru inscripţionat cu mesajul Black Lives Matter la unele curse, înainte de start şi după final. În septembrie, după ce a câştigat Marele Premiu al Toscanei, Hamilton a purtat în timp ce era intervievat un tricou cu mesajul: “Arestaţi-i pe poliţiştii care au ucis-o pe Breonna Taylor. Şi alţi piloţi şi-au arătat solidaritatea cu mişcarea de protest.",

Echipele au îngenuncheat la mijlocul terenului înainte de a ieşi.",

Noi suntem cei cărora nu li se premite să trăiască în anumite comunităţi. Am fost spânzuraţi. Am fost împuşcaţi. Şi auzim în continuare de frică”, spunea antrenorul Doc Rivers în august, când pregătea LA Clippers.",

Conducătorii NBA au afişat mesajul “Black Lives Matter” pe teren şi au permis afişarea pe echipamente de mesaje ca “Votaţi” şi “Nu pot să respir”.",
            "În tenis, la US Open s-a manifestat susţinerea faţă de mişcarea Black Lives Matter prezentându-se în tribunele în majoritate goale artă a unor artişti de culoare. Naomi Osaka a purtat măşti personalizate, fiecare cu numele unei victime a rasismului.",

Un alt gest semnificativ pentru lupta împotriva nedreptăţii sociale şi rasismului a fost cel al lui Antoine Griezmann, care a anunţat că pune capăt unui contract de sponsorizare cu Huawei, companie acuzată că facilitează încălcarea drepturilor omului, de această dată fiind vorba de musulmanii uiguri."

            "Fratele lui George Floyd a cerut ONU ”să-i ajute pe americanii de culoare”, într-o dezbatere la ONU în cursul căreia Înaltul Comisar OnU pentru Drepturile Omului Michelle Bachelet a pledat în favoarea unor reparaţii după ”secole” de violenţe rasiale, relatează AFP.",
            "Această discuţie despre rasism şi violenţele poliţiei, convocată la solicitarea ţărilor africane, continuă joi în Consiliul ONU al Drepturilor Omului, o instanţă pe care Statele Unite au părăsit-o în 2018.",
            "Reuniuena are loc în urma unei mişcări istorice care zguduie Statele Unite după moartea, la 25 mai, a Minneapolis, în Minesotta, a lui George Floyd, un afroamerican în vârstă de 46 de ani, asfixiat de către un poliţist alb.",
            "”Aveţi puterea să ne ajutaţi să obţinem dreptate”, a declarat fratele său, Philonise Floyd, într-un mesaj video pe un ton foarte combativ, difuzat în cursul reuniunii, la Geneva, cerând o ”comisie de anchetă independentă cu privire la persoanele de culoare ucise de poliţia Statelor Unite şi violenţele împotriva manifestanţilor paşnici”.",
            "Înaltul Comisar ONU pentru Drepturile Omului Michelle Bachelet a denunţat un ”act de brutalitate gratuit” care simbolizează ”rasismul sistemic”.",
            "Această dezbatere intervine după lansarea, marţi, de către preşedintele Donald Trump, a unei reforme limitate a poliţiei, printr-un decret care interzice controversatele prize prin strangulare, mai puţin în cazul în care viaţa poliţistului este în pericol. Aceste măsuri nu-i mulţumesc însă deloc pe manifestanţii americani, care reclamă, între altele, o interzicere, pur şi simplu, a acestor prize.",
            "Fără să menţioneze Statele Unite, Bachelet a denunţat ”violenţa rasială sistemică şi practicile poliţiste discriminatorii din prezent”, deplângând ”incapacitatea de a recunoaşte şi înfrunta moştenirea comerţului cu sclavi şi coloniasmul”.",
            "”Trebuie să amendăm onorabil secole de violenţe şi discriminare prin prezentarea oficială a unor scuze, procesul adevărului şi reparaţii sub diverse forme”, a declarat ea.",
            "Înaintea deschiderii dezbaterii, aproximativ 20 de funcţionari ONU de origine sau descendenţă africană - între care directorul Organizaţiei Mondiale a Sănătăţii (OMS) Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus - au semnat în nume personal o declaraţie prin care susţin că ”simpla condamnare a exprimpărilor şi actelor de rasism nu este suficientă”.",
            "”TRANSPARENŢĂ”",
            "Consiliul se pronunţă joi asupra unui proiect al unei rezoluţii prezentat de grupul african, care condamnă ”practicile rasiale discriminatorii şi violente ale forţelor de ordine împotriva africanilor şi persoanelor de origine africană şi rasismul endemic structural al sistemului penal în Statele Unite şi în alte părţi ale lumii”.",
            "În versiunea sa iniţială, textul cerea înfiinţarea unei comisii de anchetă internaţionale independente, o structură de nivel înalt, rezervată în general marilor crize, precum Războul din Siria.",
            "O nouă versiune a textului se limitează să-i ceară lui Michelle Bachelet \"să stabilească faptele şi circumstanţele relative rasismului sistemic, presupuselor încălcări ale dreptului internaţional în domeniul drepturilor omului şi rele tratamente aplicate africanilor şi persoanelor de origine africană”.",
            "Andrew Bremberg, ambasadorul Statelor Unite la ONU la Geneva, a subliniat ”transparenţa” de care dă dovadă ţara sa în domeniul luptei împotriva discriminării şi nedreptăţii rasiale, citând reforma poliţiei lansată de Trump.",
            "Numeroase ţări au recunoscut miercuri, la Geneva, că rasismul nu priveşte doar Statele Unite. Unele ţări, ca Australia, şi-au exprimat susţinerea faţă de Statele Unite şi şi-au exprimat încrederea în justiţia americană, în timp ce reprezentantul Japoniei a îndemnat la evitarea transformării subiectului într-o ”confruntare”.",
            "”PUNCTUL DIN CARE NU EXISTĂ ÎNTOARCERE”",
            "Este necesar ”să se apropie poliţia şi comunităţile, nu să se îndepărteze”, a subliniat marţi Trump, subliniindu-şi voinţa de a restaura ”legea şi ordinea”.",
            "Numai ”un foare mic” număr de agenţi comite fapte, a insistat el în declaraţii care au îmbrăcat unoeri forma unui discurs de campanie.",
            "Trump a deplâns moartea lui George Floyd şi altor victime de culoare, însă el s-a eschivat, de la începutul manifestaţiilor, de la dezbaterea cu privire la rasism.",
            "Preşedintele american are doar o putere limitată asupra serviciilor de poliţie, care se află în subordinea statelor şi oraşelor.",
            "Fără să aştepte administraţia lui Trump sau Congresul, mai multe oraşe au interzis practici poliţiste controversate după moartea lui George Floyd."

            "Statuia din Anvers a lui Leopold II, regele belgian care a impus în secolul al 19-lea un regim abuziv în Congo ce a dus la moartea a milioane de oameni, a fost înlăturată marţi de autorităţi după ce a fost ţinta recentelor proteste anti-rasism.",
            "Veche de 150 de ani, statuia regelui Leopold II al Belgiei a fost luată dintr-o piaţă publică din centrul oraşului, după ce a fost incendiată săptămâna trecută, şi dusă la Muzeul Middelheim, unde va fi restaurată şi păstrată.",
            "Timp de decenii, belgienii au fost învăţaţi că ţara lor a dus „civilizaţia” în regiunea africană şi mulţi l-au apărat pe rege ca figură fundamentală. Străzi şi parcuri îi poartă numele, iar statui care îl reprezintă pot fi văzute peste tot în ţară.",
            "În ultimii ani, tinerii în special au contrazis măştenirea lăasată în centrul Africii. Mişcarea a fost acum alimentată de protestele iscate de moartea afro-americanului George Floyd în custodia poliţiei.",
            "Săptămâna trecută, statuia lui Leopold II din Anvers a fost incendiată. Săptămâna aceasta, o alta din Ghent a fost acoperită cu vopsea roşie, scrie The New York Times. În timpul protestului de duminică din Bruxelles, la care au participat circa 10.000 de oameni, unii au urcat pe statuia lui Leopold şi au fluturat un steag al Republicii Congo, strigând „asasin” şi „compensaţii”.",
            "Până marţi seară, 65.000 de oameni au semnat o petiţie pentru înlăturarea tuturor statuilor din ţară care îl reprezintă pe Lopold II.",
            "Un purtător de cuvânt al primarului, Bart De Wever, a spus că statuia nu a fost demontată în urma protestelor, ci pentru că, fiind avariată, reprezintă o „problemă de siguranţă publică”. Partidul din care face parte primarul este de dreapta şi a solicitat în mai multe rânduri reprimarea imigraţiei.",
            "Purtătorul de cuvânt a spus că ea este dusă la muzeu şi restaurată. El a adăugat că piaţa în care a stat urmează să fie reamenajată în 2023, „probabil fără un spaţiu pentru statuie”.",
            "„Demontarea statuilor este importantă la nivel simbolic, dar este doar începutul”, a spus Joëlle Sambi Nzeba, de origine congoleză, purtătoare de cuvânt a Belgian Network for Black Lives. „Monumentele sunt prezente nu doar în spaţiul public, dar şi în mentalităţile oamenilor”.",
            "Monumentele de acest fel au devenit ţinta protestatarilor din multe oraşe, atât americane, cât şi europene.",
            "În Bristol, statuia Edward Colston, important negustor de sclavi din secolul 17, a fost dărâmată şi aruncată în râu, duminică, iar în Londra, o statuie a lui Robert Milligan, negustor de sclavi din secolul 18, a fost înlăturată marţi.",
            "Leopold II, născut în 1835, a devenit rege în 1865 şi s-a conturat ca simbol al exploatării europene în Africa. Până în 1908, el a condus Congo pentru propriul profit. Folosind o armată privată, formată din orfani congolezi, regele şi agenţii lui au secat ţara de resurse, au ucis elefanţi pentru fildeş şi au exploatat arborii pentru cauciuc. Numeroase familii au fost strămutate cu forţa, membrii lor separaţi şi făcuţi sclavi, lăsând în urmă 10 milioane de morţi, potrivit unor estimări.",
            "Fortele armate ale lui Leopold au devenit notorii chiar şi între puterile coloniale europene, iar în 1906, regele negând acuzaţiile de comitere a atrocităţilor a recunoscut că au fost comise „cel mai probabil cruzimi şi chiar crime”.",
            "Leopold II a renunţat la tronul belgian în 1908, iar Congo şi-a dobândit independenţa în 1960. Perioada în care a fost colonie a pregătit terenul pentru războiul civil şi dictatura care au urmat mulţi ani.",
            "Recent, în Belgia a fost reformat Africa Museum, de la periferia capitalei Bruxelles, şi au fost înlăturate din colecţia lui multe clişee rasiste şi pro-coloniale.",
            "În ultimii ani au fost făcute numeroase apeluri ca Belgia să plătească despăgubiri Republicii Democrate Congo. În 2018, Organizaţia Naţiunilor Unite a cerut guvernului Belgiei să prezinte scuze pentru crimele comise în timpul perioadei coloniale şi să ofere despăgubiri, pentru a „încheia un capitol negru în istoria şi ca măd de reconciliere”.",
            "În aprilie 2019, Belgia a prezentat scuze pentru răpirea, segregarea, deportarea şi adopţia forţată a mii de copii născuţi în cupluri birasiale în timp ce a condus Burundi, Congo şi Rwanda. A fost prima dată când Belgia şi-a recunoscut responsabilitatea pentru ceea ce istoricii au descris ca un prejudiciu teribil provocat naţiunilor din centrul Africii în timpul celor 80 de ani de colonizare."

Nu ar fi trebuit. Asta doar zgârie suprafaţa feţei hidoase a rasismului din America. Ia-ţi un moment să-ţi imaginezi acest lucru: Dacă brutalitatea poliţiei poate exista şi este tolerată atâţia ani la această scară, imaginează-ţi celelalte acte subtile de rasism care pătrund în ţara noastră: La serviciu. În sistemul de justiţie. În sistemul de sănătate. În sistemul de învăţământ... A vorbi despre rasism în trecut era nepopular. Era respins. Nimeni nu te credea. Până nu ai simţit asta, ca afro-american, este imposibil să înţelegi provocările cu care te confruntaţi în ţară, în această lume. Cum este să fii neauzit, considerat ca nebun, prost sau nechibzuit să crezi că rasismul există încă la toate nivelurile. Asta nu mai este de ignorat. Sunt uimită de solidaritatea care a izbucnit în SUA. M-a adus în lacrimi. În trecut, am avut onoarea de a lupta pentru bani egali pentru toate jucătoarele la grand slam-urile die tenis. Pentru a face acest lucru şi mai simplu de înţeles, la fel cum sexismul nu este doar o <problemă a femeilor>, rasismul nu este doar o <problemă a negrilor>. Când am luptat şi am câştigat premii egale, toată lumea s-a implicat, bărbaţi şi femei, de toate culorile, din toate rasele. Şi am câştigat. Atunci când grupurile majoritare stau tăcute, când stau pe scaunul neîncrederii, ele închid ochii în mod involuntar la opresiunea grupurilor marginalizate. Cei cu putere şi privilegii sunt de fapt mai uşoar de auzit. Ei trebuie să exercite în mod continuu acel privilegiu! TREBUIE să câştigăm! Nu putem lăsa să persiste rasismul sistematic.

            "Celebrul grup disco Village People se desolidarizează de Donald Trump. După ce i-au permis să folosească melodiile, formaţia şi-a schimbat părerea din cauza că preşedintele american a promis să \"trimită armata\" în cazul în care protestele după moartea lui George Floyd nu încetează.",
            "Floyd, un american în vârstă de 46 de ani, a murit în timpul unei arestări.",
            "\"Dacă Trump ordonă armatei americane să tragă în propriii cetăţeni (pe teritoriul american), americanii vor manifesta într-un număr atât de mare în faţa Casei Albe încât va fi nevoit să renunţe la funcţie înaintea alegerilor. Nu o faceţi, domnule preşedinte!\", a scris pe contul de Facebook cântăreţul Victor Willis, care întruchipează \"poliţistul\" în grup. \"Şi vă cer să nu mai folosiţi muzica mea la adunări, mai ales \"Y.M.C.A\" şi \"Macho Man\". Îmi pare rău, dar nu pot să susţin ce vă propuneţi\".",
            "Village People nu a fost mereu de această părere. Atunci când fanii se întrebau cu privire la folosirea melodiilor grupului de către Trump, formaţia a răspuns în februarie pe Facebook: \"Nu a exagerat, difuzarea melodiilor de preşedinte este legală. El a fost respectuos în modul în care a beneficiat de cântecele noastre (...). Dacă el sau alt candidat foloseau unul dintre cântecele noastre într-o manieră care ar putea sugera sprijinul nostru, sau în publicitate promoţională, ar fi prea mult\".",

Este o unealtă care să vă ajute să discutaţi despre problemele rasismului la locul de muncă, în oraşele şi şcolile voastre. Nu este nici măcar primul pas. Este începutul cercetării voastre în drumul spre pasul întâi”, a scris Oluo pe Twitter.",

Trebuie să acordaţi acestei munci timp şi respect”, a mai scris autoarea.",

            "Eddo-Lodge le-a cerut cumpărătorilor cărţii ei să facă o donaţie similară preţului volumului pentru Minnesota Freedom Fund. Autoarea a donat 1.000 de dolari.",
            "„Financiar, această carte mi-a transformat viaţa şi chiar nu îmi place ideea de a profita personal de fiecare dată când înregistrarea video a morţii unei persoane de culoare devine virală pe internet”, a scris autoarea.",
            "George Floyd, bărbat de culoare din Minneapolis, a fost ucis pe 25 mai. Patru poliţişti au fost concediaţi şi, iniţial, doar unul a fost pus sub acuzare - Derek Chauvin, care a îngenuncheat pe gâtul lui Floyd timp de aproximativ 9 minute, este acuzat de crimă de gradul trei şi ucidere din culpă de gradul doi. Pe 3 iunie, a fost anunţat că ceilalţi trei ofiţeri sunt acuzaţi de ajutor şi complicitate la omor.",

        "body": [
            "Opening statements are March 29 if the jury is complete.",
            "MINNEAPOLIS — A judge on Friday denied a defense request to delay or move the trial of a former Minneapolis police officer charged in George Floyd’s death after the announcement of a $27 million settlement for Floyd’s family raised concern about a tainted jury.",
            "In a separate ruling, Hennepin County Judge Peter Cahill said he would allow the jury to hear limited evidence from Floyd’s 2019 arrest, but only that pertaining to the cause of Floyd’s death in 2020. He acknowledged there are several similarities between the two incidents, including that Floyd swallowed drugs after police confronted him.",
            "The rulings were a blow to Derek Chauvin's defense. His attorney, Eric Nelson, had sought to halt or move the trial due to concerns that the settlement announcement had tainted the jury pool.",
            "Jury selection was halfway complete last week when the city of Minneapolis unanimously approved the payout to settle a civil lawsuit over Floyd’s death. Nelson called the timing of the settlement deeply disturbing and unfair, and said it jeopardized Chauvin’s chance for a fair trial. Chauvin is charged with murder and manslaughter.",
            "But Cahill, who has called the timing “unfortunate,” said he thought a delay would do nothing to stem the problem of pretrial publicity. As for moving the trial, he said there’s no place in Minnesota that hasn’t been touched by that publicity.",
            "The judge had previously denied a defense attempt to allow the year-old arrest at trial. But he heard fresh arguments this week because of drugs found in January in a second search of the police SUV in which the four officers attempted to put Floyd in 2020.",
            "He said Thursday that he would allow medical evidence of Floyd's physical reactions, such as his dangerously high blood pressure when he was examined by a paramedic, and a short clip of an officer’s body camera video. He said Floyd’s “emotional behavior” such as calling out to his mother in 2019 won’t be admitted.",
            "Nelson argued that similarities between the encounters are relevant, with Floyd calling out for his mother, claiming he had been shot before, crying and putting what appeared to be pills in his mouth.",
            "Prosecutor Matthew Frank said the defense was simply looking for a backdoor way to portray Floyd as a bad person, and the only relevant issue in Floyd’s death is how he was treated by police.",
            "Floyd, who was Black, was declared dead May 25 after Chauvin, who is white, pressed his knee on Floyd’s neck for about nine minutes while he was handcuffed and pleading that he couldn’t breathe. Floyd’s death, captured on a widely seen bystander video, set off weeks of sometimes-violent protests across the country and led to a national reckoning on racial justice.",
            "Just two more jurors were needed for the trial. The 12 jurors seated through Thursday are evenly split by race, with six white jurors, four Black and two multiracial, according to the court. The last two jurors chosen will be alternates.",
            "Opening statements are March 29 if the jury is complete. That process was on track to finish nearly a week early despite news that the city would pay a $27 million settlement to Floyd's family.",
            "Jurors added Thursday include a white registered nurse in her 50s who assured the court that she wouldn’t draw on her medical knowledge at Chauvin’s trial, and a Black woman in her 60s who said she didn’t watch the entire bystander video of Floyd’s arrest and didn’t know enough to form a firm opinion of Chauvin or Floyd.",
            "The 12th juror seated, a white woman in her 40s who works in commercial insurance, said she has experience with someone who struggled with alcohol, and might view someone who uses drugs cautiously, saying they could act violently or aggressively when under the influence.",
            "But she said she doesn't believe someone who uses drugs or doesn’t cooperate with police should be treated poorly. “If someone uses drugs, I don’t think there should be ramifications of violence for that,” she said.",
            "Three other former officers face an August trial in Floyd’s death on charges of aiding and abetting second-degree murder and manslaughter."

            "A year after George Floyd’s death, police reform is still top-of-mind and shaping mayoral contests in Minneapolis, New York City, Boston, Atlanta, Detroit and Seattle.",
            "The rush to slash police funding and add new limits on use of force in the wake of George Floyd’s death hasn’t stopped policing from emerging as a top issue in big city mayoral contests across the country.",
            "In Minneapolis, critics say the mayor should have done more to defund the police department, and the city is on edge as the trial for Floyd's killing begins. In Atlanta, the mayor is facing a challenge from the right amid a spike in crime that has led one wealthy neighborhood to float seceding from the city. And in open races in Seattle and Boston, activists worry candidates who say they support big changes to the police department won’t deliver.",
            "The fury of 2020 has quickly become a permanent fixture in urban mayoral politics, creating a litmus test some candidates must pass.",
            "“If elected officials don’t take police brutality seriously, people are realizing they can vote them out of office and put someone in their seats who care,” Mary Sheffield, the Detroit City Council president pro tempore, told POLITICO. “Black voters in particular have awakened to see they have the ability wield real power.”",
            "A year after Floyd’s death ignited racial justice protests all over the country, police reform is shaping the mayoral contests in Minneapolis, New York City, Boston, Atlanta, Detroit and Seattle.",
            "All the cities except New York hold nonpartisan elections, and all are run by Democrats. They all could serve as political barometers ahead of the 2022 congressional midterms, coming during a year in which few states are holding major elections.",
            "Here’s a field guide to the issues and the candidates in those half dozen races.",
            "Minneapolis",
            "George Floyd’s death in this city of 420,000 was the catalyst for racial justice protests across the country, and where the slogan \"Defund the police\" gained national attention. Mayor Jacob Frey ran on a promise to improve the tense relationship between police and city residents when he was elected in 2018. But his campaign pledge came into question after police killed Floyd, which was documented in a disturbing video.",
            "Frey soon came under harsh scrutiny in the months that followed, notably when he was booed out of a protest by activists for declining to call for defunding the police. Now, the first-term Frey faces two challengers: Activist Sheila Nezhad, who was an advocate for reallocating police funding as an organizer for grassroots group Reclaim the Block, and former state Rep. Kate Knuth, who supports creating a new police force but not “abolishing“ policing. Both are Democrats.",
            "The push to defund the police has skeptics even in deep blue cities. In Minneapolis, the City Council voted to shift some money away from the police department last year, and is pushing a proposal to replace the department with a new public safety agency, but Frey and others have stood in the way of dismantling the force. ",
            "The city is preparing for the trial of police officer Derek Chauvin, the officer charged with third-degree murder in Floyd's death. Chauvin's trial could spark another round of protests and calls for reform in the city. Minneapolis recently agreed to pay Floyd's family a $27 million settlement in the wake of his death. ",
            "Many people in Minneapolis are still trying to “fully understand what happened last summer,\" said City Council President Lisa Bender, who is not running for reelection and has not endorsed in the mayoral race. ",
            "\"People are in a really emotional place about public safety in Minneapolis,” Bender said, describing the city as “tense” ahead of the Chauvin trial. “Folks are really still reeling from what happened last summer.”",
            "Atlanta ",
            "Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms faces a challenge from City Council President Felicia Moore amid rising homicides in the city. Contested mayoral races are rare in Atlanta, where the last high-profile challenge to an incumbent occurred in the late 1990s. ",
            "Protests over Floyd's killing came to a head in Atlanta last summer, and Bottoms placed new limits on police use of force in the weeks that followed. Bottoms is seeking a second term after being elected in 2017. Moore, also a Democrat, is running on a platform that includes \"safer neighborhoods\" in response to the city's rising crime rate. ",
            "\"It is very interesting to see that progressive forces can be put into motion, and engage in the kind of protests we saw and the kind of advocacy we saw, and then see internally a backlash against that,\" said Xochitl Bervera, an attorney and organizer in Atlanta. \"You see the kind of, what I would say, are the status quo holders, the people that have a vested self interest in things staying how they are.\" ",
            "But even with crime being top of mind for voters, the political environment in Atlanta can't be easily defined as for or against defunding the police, said former Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed. The city's wealthy, majority-white Buckhead neighborhood has even considered seceding from the city so it can create it’s own police force. ",
            "\"It's really complex,“ Reed said. “I don't think it's the opposite of defund the police. I think that there's a real desire for hands-on involvement. And I think that that has been very difficult in a Covid environment.”",
            "\"There was a fracture in the community relationship with the police around the Rayshard Brooks murder, and we really haven't been able to put the relationship between the community and the police back together,\" Reed added. ",
            "Georgia was a pivotal state in the 2020 election, and the mayoral race in its state capital is likely to draw national attention. Bottoms has also been an ally of President Joe Biden, and was considered for a role in the president's administration. ",
            "Boston ",
            "Boston is at an electoral turning point. In a city that has been run by white men for its entire history, the five major candidates to replace outgoing Boston Mayor Marty Walsh are people of color. ",
            "City Council President Kim Janey will soon be Boston’s first Black woman acting mayor once Walsh is confirmed as Biden’s labor secretary. Janey is is widely expected to enter the race. ",
            "Already, City Councilors Michelle Wu, Andrea Campbell and Annissa Essaibi George are already running for the seat, along with state Rep.  Jon Santiago and John Barros, Boston's former chief of economic development.",
            "Campbell has made reform central to her bid for mayor, and is proposing a $50 million budget cut to the city's police force. ",
            "Police reform efforts are underway in Boston, a city that's been slow to change its racist reputation. City leaders disappointed activists when they opted to cut 3 percent of the city's police budget last year in a high-profile vote. Walsh convened a task force in the wake of Floyd's death, and recently signed a new law to establish a police accountability office, based off recommendations from that group. Boston is \"ground zero\" for racism and policing problems, said activist Jamarhl Crawford, but he gives credit to Walsh's recent efforts. ",
            "\"These last two years have seen more done for police reform in Boston than for my entire lifetime,\" said Crawford, who is a member of Boston's police reform task force. ",
            "Tensions between police and protesters are still high, though. The Boston Police Department faced scrutiny for how it responded to racial justice protests after body cam footage showed one officer beating protesters, and another appear to brag about hitting protesters with his vehicle. ",
            "Police reform has been a major theme in the race for mayor, but Crawford cautioned that messaging from the candidates may not match what they would do if elected. ",
            "\"What happened with police reform, in my opinion is, it became the cause célèbre so everybody's talking about it,\" Crawford said. \"In this age of protest and Black Lives Matter and all this type of stuff, I think a lot of people are trying to portray themselves a wee bit more revolutionary than they really are.\" ",
            "Leadership of the department is also in limbo. Boston Police Commissioner Dennis White was placed on leave just two days after he was appointed the city's top cop, when domestic violence allegations surfaced from the 1990s.",
            "New York City ",
            "New York City saw widespread protests in the wake of Floyd’s death. The city soon pledged to cut $1 billion from the police budget, though the actual amount of funding cut fell short of that goal. Now, almost all the leading mayoral candidates say NYPD Commissioner Dermot Shea should be replaced by the next mayoral administration, though opinions differ on who the new commissioner should be. ",
            "Well over a dozen serious candidates are vying to replace term-limited Mayor Bill DeBlasio, who has been criticized for losing control of his police department during his time as mayor. Candidates vocal on police issues include Maya Wiley, who used to chair a police watchdog agency, and Dianne Morales, who serves on the board of the city’s Human Services Council. ",
            "“On the issue of policing, there is a big shift. It is one of the top issues that is discussed. That has not always been the case,” said Kumar Rao of the Working Families Party, a significant third party in New York. “This time around, it’s not just reform that’s at the ballot box, but real transformation and rethinking of how we approach public safety as a whole.” ",
            "A spike in crime could complicate the push for reform. Major New York City crimes in January were at the highest rate for that month since de Blasio took office in 2014. But political watchers acknowledge the dynamic could change in an instant. ",
            "\"New York City is always one bad shooting or terrible video away from mass movements in the streets like we saw last summer,” said Eric Phillips, a Democratic strategist and former aide to de Blasio. “In a city that is this dynamic, with this many people, that involves this many every day human interactions, the possibility that will happen in the next several months is high. This could all change overnight.”",
            "Detroit ",
            "Mayor Mike Duggan is seeking a third term  and faces a challenge from Anthony Adams, the former deputy mayor. Adams, who lists reforming police and reducing crime as top priorities, faces an uphill battle against the well-funded mayor.",
            "Detroit has one of the highest crime rates in the country, and leaders there have faced calls to reform how police do their jobs. In the fall, a federal judge put a temporary ban on certain use-of-force police measures, including chokeholds.",
            "But the city has addressed the push for police reform earlier than some other parts of the country, former Mayor Kenneth Cockrel said. Detroit has a majority-Black police force, and dealt with some police brutality issues decades ago. ",
            "\"In some ways we went through it earlier and before a number of other cities,\" Cockrel said. \"Certainly after George Floyd's death, like a lot of major cities, we had at [a] certain point, nightly protests that were taking place.

Floyd’s death sparked sometimes violent protests in Minneapolis and beyond and led to a national reckoning on racial justice. Chauvin is charged with second-degree murder, third-degree murder and manslaughter. At least three weeks have been set aside for jury selection.",
            "In the midst of jury selection, Minneapolis last week agreed to pay $27 million to settle a civil rights lawsuit from Floyd’s family over his death. Floyd family attorney Ben Crump called it the largest pretrial settlement ever for a civil rights claim. The settlement includes $500,000 for the south Minneapolis neighborhood that includes the 38th and Chicago intersection that has been blocked by barricades since Floyd's death, with a massive metal sculpture and murals in his honor. The city didn’t immediately say how that money would be spent.",

But they doubted it would really affect the criminal trial. Judge Peter Cahill has told members of the jury pool to avoid all news coverage about the case.",

            "Hennepin County Judge Peter Cahill reinstated the charge after the former officer, Derek Chauvin, failed to get appellate courts to block it. Cahill had earlier rejected the charge as not warranted by the circumstances of Floyd’s death, but an appellate court ruling in an unrelated case established new grounds for it.",
            "Chauvin already faced second-degree murder and manslaughter charges. Legal experts say the additional charge helps prosecutors by giving jurors one more option to convict Chauvin of murder.",
            "The dispute over the third-degree murder charge revolved around wording in the law that references an act “eminently dangerous to others.” Cahill had earlier dismissed the charge as not appropriate for the case, where Chauvin’s conduct might be construed as not dangerous to anyone but Floyd.",
            "But prosecutors sought to revive the charge after the state’s Court of Appeals recently upheld the third-degree murder conviction of another former Minneapolis police officer in the 2017 killing of an Australian woman. They argued that the ruling established precedent that a third-degree murder charge may be brought even in a case where only a single person is endangered.",
            "Arguments over when precedent from former officer Mohamed Noor's case took effect went swiftly to the state’s Supreme Court, which on Wednesday said it would not consider Chauvin’s appeal of the matter. Cahill said Thursday he accepts that precedent is now clear.",

He said he agrees that there are bad police officers.",
            "\"Are there good ones? Yes. So I don’t think it’s right to completely blame the entire organization,” he told the court under questioning from prosecutor Steve Schleicher.",
            "He also said he would be more inclined to believe an officer over the word of another witness. But he said he could set aside any ideas about the inherent honesty of an officer and evaluate each witness on their own.",
            "The second, a man who works in information technology security, marked “strongly agree” on a question about whether he believes police in his community make him feel safe. His community wasn’t specified — jurors are being drawn from all over Hennepin County, which includes Minneapolis and many of its suburbs.",
            "“In my community, I think when there is suspicious activity the police will stop by, they will ask a question,” he said. “I think that sense of community is all we want right? We want to live in a community where we feel safe regardless of race, color and gender.”",
            "Schleicher noted that the man also stated in his questionnaire that he strongly disagreed with the concept of “defunding” the police, which has become a political flashpoint locally and across the country in the wake of Floyd’s death.",
            "“While I necessarily might not agree with the police action in some situation, I believe that in order for police to make my community safe they have to have the money,” he replied.",
            "The questionnaire explores potential jurors' familiarity with the case and their own contacts with police. Their answers have not been made public, and the jurors’ identities are being kept secret. Their racial backgrounds often aren’t disclosed in open court.",

In addition, testimony about what training Chauvin received will be allowed.",

            "Unlike typical jury selection proceedings, potential jurors will be questioned individually rather than in a group. The judge, defense attorney and prosecutors will all get to ask questions. The defense can object to up to 15 potential jurors without giving a reason; prosecutors can block up to nine without providing a reason. Either side can object to these peremptory challenges if they believe the sole reason for disqualifying a juror is race or gender.",

            "The House passed a sweeping police reform bill Wednesday, nine months after George Floyd’s death galvanized the nation into protests for racial justice and days before his killer goes on trial.",
            "The vote was 220-212, with all but two Democrats, Reps. Jared Golden of Maine and Ron Kind of Wisconsin, supporting it. Just one Republican, Rep. Lance Gooden of Texas, voted to pass the bill. Gooden later tweeted that he doesn’t support the bill and said he “changed the official record to reflect my opposition!” (Golden and Kind supported the measure last year, while Gooden opposed it.)",
            "The vote was moved up from Thursday over concerns of a potential security threat from “militia violent extremists” who may try to seize control of the complex on or around March 4 — a date some conspiracy theorists believe is when former President Donald Trump will return to power. (Inauguration Day took place on that date until it was changed to Jan. 20 in the 1930s.)",
            "The bill was drafted by the Congressional Black Caucus last summer and advanced the House last year in a bipartisan vote that included every Democrat and three Republicans. But it went nowhere in the Senate of Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.).",
            "In floor remarks ahead of the vote, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said the bill won’t “erase centuries of systemic racism and excessive policing” or bring back Floyd, Breonna Taylor or any other Black Americans who were killed by police. But it will be “a tremendous step” toward stopping the violence and stemming the suffering, she said.",
            "“We cannot accept this epidemic of injustice,” Pelosi said. “We cannot stay silent when our most vulnerable and historically marginalized communities … are being targeted and sometimes killed. That is why today, the House will again pass the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act and send it to the Senate and the president’s desk so that it can finally become the law of the land.”",
            "The bill’s revival — and second passage — comes as the trial nears for former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin. Bystanders recorded Chauvin pinning his knee into Floyd’s neck for nearly eight minutes as a group of fellow officers stood by. The footage sparked outrage that transformed into protests across the globe in the middle of the pandemic, with many activists calling for legislators to “defund the police.”",
            "Few House Democrats support calls to literally defund police departments — despite House Republicans’ repeated false claims during debate Wednesday that the bill would do just that — but their response to nationwide protests is the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, a measure that civil rights leaders have said is just as important as legislation that came out of the 1960s civil rights movement, like the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act.",

The federal policies would be tied to law enforcement funding for governments at the state and local levels. ",
            "The measure would also eliminate qualified immunity for law enforcement, mandate data collection on police encounters and create a nationwide police misconduct registry to hold accountable problematic officers who are fired or leave an agency.",
            "Unlike last summer, Democrats now control the Senate and have an ally in the White House. But the bill’s fate in the upper chamber is still uncertain, as Democrats would need at least 10 Republicans to send the legislation to President Joe Biden’s desk.",
            "“We will begin those discussions with the Senate immediately after the bill is passed,” Rep. Karen Bass (D-Calif.), who introduced the bill last Congress, told reporters Wednesday morning. ",
            "Bass expressed confidence on a conference call with reporters Wednesday morning that the bill would draw bipartisan support in Congress and make its way to Biden to be signed into law. She said discussions with senators, including Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and Tim Scott (R-S.C.), have been underway for weeks. ",
            "At a news conference Wednesday night with Democratic leaders and CBC members, Bass said many GOP senators thought they could come around to supporting the bill last year but had “some difficulties.”",
            "“One of the things that has happened in the last 12 months, though, is that many states moved ahead without us, and they started passing reforms,” she said after the vote. “So this time when we sit down to meet, we can talk about reforms that are already in place. … So we have a lot of bases in which to begin discussions, and that’s what we plan to do.”",
            "Rep. Jamaal Bowman (D-N.Y.) said he’s excited about some of the provisions but acknowledged that there’s much more work to do around police reform.",

            "George Floyd didn’t live to see Kamala Harris become vice president. Nor was he alive to see an investigation into Breonna Taylor’s death find that her killer’s gunfire was justified.",
            "But his legacy will determine which America his daughter, Gianna — and the next generation of young Americans — will grow up in: the nation in which a record number of voters can elect a Black woman into the White House. Or the country in which Taylor's killer isn't going to trial, but the officer who shot her neighbors' wall is. ",
            "After a summer of protests, the coming weeks will show how much has really changed since Floyd’s death — in Washington, D.C., the judicial system, and America itself. Next week, jury selection commences for the trial of Derek Chauvin, the former Minneapolis police officer who was filmed pinning his knee into Floyd’s neck for seven minutes and 46 seconds. ",
            "And in Congress this week, Democrats are trying once again to shape Floyd’s legacy by advancing federal legislation to reform policing. The House is expected to vote on the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act — again. The bill passed the chamber last summer but was never taken up by the then-Republican-controlled Senate. ",
            "“In light of what happened to George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, now is the time to get this bill passed and on President Biden’s desk,” said Rep. Joyce Beatty (D-Ohio), chair of the Congressional Black Caucus.",
            "The bill would ban chokeholds, end racial and religious profiling, eliminate qualified immunity for law enforcement and mandate data collection on police encounters. Civil rights leaders like Rev. Al Sharpton are pushing for its passage. But centrist Democrats have their concerns about some provisions of the bill. And it’s not clear how it’ll fare in the Senate. ",
            "Which means it’ll be up to cities and states to overhaul the nation’s beleaguered criminal justice system. But so far, results are mixed. ",
            "In the wake of Floyd’s death in May, 25 states enacted new policing laws. But even so, some of those new laws have little to do with improved policing or increased accountability. Instead, they focus on lessening bureaucratic hurdles such as easing residency requirements. ",
            "Other laws prohibit chokeholds, update training standards and require officers to have body-worn cameras. Other notable policies include laws that increase penalties for falsely summoning officers or making false reports. Whether those reforms represent real change depends on whom you ask.",
            "“If ‘reimagining policing’ is a phrase, if ‘defund the police’ is a phrase, if ‘abolish the police’ is a phrase, how do we move from essentially a hashtag to budget-specific, legislative-specific, regulatory-specific, community-specific solutions in real time?” said Cornell William Brooks, professor of the practice of public leadership and social justice at Harvard University and a former NAACP president.",
            "“It’s one thing to call for a whole-scale transformation,” said Brooks who is working with a team of students to help mayors reimagine what policing looks like in terms of budgets, legislation, regulation and police culture. ",
            "But it’s just as necessary, Brooks said, “to figure out, ‘What does that mean at a granular level?’”",
            "Floyd’s death nine months ago was unlike any of those before him. It was familiar in the sense that, yet again, an unarmed Black American was killed by a white police officer. And as he begged for oxygen, his cries mirrored the language of Eric Garner nearly six years prior. Garner, a Black man who was put into a fatal chokehold by police, repeatedly said, “I can’t breathe,” while under restraint.",
            "The deaths of Taylor, Garner, Ahmaud Arbery, Atatiana Jefferson, Botham Jean, Philando Castile, Alton Sterling, Laquan McDonald, Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown, Tamir Rice, Freddie Gray and so many others like them who were killed by police officers or vigilantes sparked outrage and protests. But the aftermath of Floyd’s death was different.",
            "“It was just disappointing and really heartbreaking to see just how little progress was made to the point where a police officer could kneel on someone for almost nine minutes, with people videotaping — and they could see folks filming them — with the whole world watching and not care,” said Erika Maye, deputy director of criminal justice and democracy campaigns with the racial justice organization Color Of Change.",
            "Footage of Floyd’s fatal encounter reverberated across the globe, uniting people of all races, and igniting worldwide protests for racial justice and against police brutality.",
            "“I never expected it to turn into what it did,” New York state Sen. Brian Benjamin said of the ensuing movement. “This took on a life of its own.”",
            "“That level of interaction and interest across the board is what changed the game here in New York state,” said Benjamin, a candidate for New York City comptroller, who introduced anti-chokehold legislation after Garner’s death. The bill passed in June in “record time,” Benjamin said. ",
            "“All of a sudden this became an issue for everybody,” Benjamin said. ",
            "Last week, leaders from civil rights groups convened a virtual news conference to demand the passage of the federal police reform bill. ",
            "Sharpton, president of the National Action Network, said the bill is just as important as the legislation that came out of the 1960s civil rights movement — the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act.",
            "“We’ll be going to Minneapolis for the jury selection of the police officer that lynched George Floyd with his knee,” Sharpton told reporters. “The family will have to sit there and relive this. ",
            "“I would hope that they would be able to sit there knowing that the laws have changed and that George was not lynched in vain and that the Senate of 2021 has the same backbone and integrity that the Senate had in 1964.”",
            "Floyd’s death has opened a new level of conversation about policing in communities across the country. Despite the villainization of the slogan to “defund the police,” policymakers and policy experts say they’re now able to have conversations about reimagining policing and holding police accountable in a way they couldn’t before.",
            "“The defund movement is about taking away resources or shifting resources, which doesn’t do anything for improving accountability and oversight for whatever remains after the defunding or shifting of resources,” said Loren Taylor, an Oakland city council member. “The reality is if you want police to do better, you hold them accountable. If you want them to do less, you take away resources.”",
            "Floyd’s death showed plainly the type of experiences Black people have long had with law enforcement, leading to increased support for the Black Lives Matter movement, the acknowledgment of racism and the role it plays in American society, and conversations about addressing the many inequities African Americans face in housing, health care, education, employment and other areas.",
            "Still, that talk hasn’t led to action everywhere. As the Chauvin trial nears, Dave Bicking, a board member of Minneapolis-based Communities United Against Police Brutality, said the city is already off to a bad start. ",
            "Bicking said Minneapolis is creating a false narrative by putting up fences and barbed wire and planning to bring in the National Guard, arguing that police violence is what the city should be concerned about. He also said the city council has fallen short on enacting meaningful, post-Floyd policy changes.",
            "“There has been very little change,” Bicking said. “There’s radical talk but no action to speak of. A few steps backward and a process, I think, designed to lead to nowhere.”",
            "Despite talk of defunding or even abolishing police in Minneapolis, Bicking said, neither outcome looks likely.",
            "“The net effect of it has been virtually nothing has changed,” he added. “The people in our city government don’t act like they realize this is the epicenter of a movement, a huge movement, and something which is history-making and which is for better or worse going to really cause some change here.”",
            "Black Americans are hopeful Chauvin will be convicted. But many have learned not to get their hopes up after disappointing outcomes in high-profile cases that have led to acquittal or no indictment in recent years.",
            "“Black people have been let down a lot, on so many levels, and when it comes to trust, I think as a people we definitely have trust issues. Rightfully so,” said Kamau Marshall, a former spokesperson for Joe Biden’s presidential campaign and a former senior congressional staffer. “We all know what the outcome should be, but what we’ve seen in the past with various outcomes in most cases have not gone the best way.”",
            "Last week, New York Attorney General Letitia James announced that a grand jury voted not to indict any officers involved in the death of Daniel Prude, a Black man who was experiencing a psychotic episode when police handcuffed him, put a mesh hood over his head and pinned him to the ground until he was unconscious. ",
            "The grand jury’s decision was a disappointment, but not a surprise for Tianna Mañón, CEO of Mañón Media Management and a former journalist who now works with reporters and newsrooms on equity in coverage and storytelling. ",
            "“You knew this was coming and yet it still hurts,” Mañón said. “It’s a pain you can’t prepare for because these people are just gonna continue living their lives, and not even just continue living their lives but within this community, so to speak.”",
            "Sakira Cook, senior director of the justice program at The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, said she hopes the prosecution can prove that Chauvin acted outside the bounds of the law and took Floyd’s life with what he thought was impunity.",
            "“It is not often the case that officers are arrested, indicted and then put on trial for these types of incidents,” she said. “So anytime that does happen, that is a step in the right direction.”",
            "There’s no consensus on what Floyd’s legacy will be. Some say it’s too soon to say, while others envision a future where police departments cease to exist as conversations about rethinking public safety and who should respond to what continue. But perhaps Floyd’s daughter said it best.",
            "“I keep replaying in my mind the clip of his daughter saying, ‘My daddy changed the world,’” Cook said. “And that, for me, sums up beautifully what I hope his legacy will be. I hope we will look at that moment as the spark that ignited a transformation in this country on all fronts but also one that permeated the rest of the globe.”"

            "The departure of Marty Walsh for the Biden administration creates a rare open-seat opportunity in the city — and sets up an election that will be dominated by a debate about issues surrounding race.",
            "BOSTON — More than 250 years after a Black man became the first casualty of the American Revolution, felled by British troops during the Boston Massacre, this city of 700,000 still hasn’t elected a mayor who isn’t a white man. ",
            "Now, nearly a year after George Floyd’s death touched off a national reckoning on race, the two major candidates already running to replace Washington-bound Mayor Marty Walsh are both women of color. There are many more non-white politicians thinking about launching campaigns. And the City Council president, a Black woman, is first in line to become acting mayor.",
            "The departure of Walsh — President Joe Biden's nominee for Labor secretary — creates a rare open-seat opportunity in a city where no incumbent has lost reelection in 72 years. The free-for-all that’s likely to ensue, with a pile-on of Democratic candidates vying for one of the most coveted jobs in Massachusetts politics, means there’s no guarantee a woman or non-white candidate will win.",
            "But one thing is already clear: The race will be dominated by a debate about the issues surrounding race — and whether the city has done enough, in every facet of its operations, to lift up residents from minority and historically marginalized communities. The outcome could also be a symbol of change for a city that has been slow to shed its racist image. ",
            "\"Marty's leaving in a moment when this entire country, this entire city, is going through a reckoning on what we're gonna do about race. I want race to be right where it should be at the forefront of these conversations,\" Boston state Rep. Russell Holmes, a member of the Massachusetts Black and Latino Legislative Caucus, said in an interview. ",
            "\"Whether it be education, transportation, everything that is economic development, the underlying thing that so few of us talk about is race,” he said. “That won't be allowed to happen at this moment.”",
            "Those early election-year dynamics in Boston offer a precursor what other major cities will be facing this year: Mayoral contests in Atlanta, Minneapolis, New York City and elsewhere will wrestle with the fallout from the widespread protests for racial justice last spring and summer, and calls for police reform, in the wake of Floyd’s death.",
            "The past year has secured the Black Lives Matter movement as a permanent fixture of local politics in American cities, and in states across the country. New York, Minnesota and Connecticut are among states that passed major new police reform laws this year — as did Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker. City budget debates have been shaped by the push to “defund the police.”",
            "In Boston, Walsh declared racism a public health crisis in June and hired the city's first chief diversity officer. He convened a police reform task force and, ultimately, signed an ordinance to create a new Office of Police Accountability and Transparency at the beginning of January, establishing a civilian review board for public complaints and bolstering the Boston Police Department's ability to conduct internal investigations. ",
            "Still, inequality is stark in the city. The net worth of a Black family in the Greater Boston area was $8, while the net work of a white family in the same region was $247,500, according to a 2015 study by the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, Duke University and the New School. And just under a quarter of Boston's middle class is Black, earning between 75 percent to 125 percent of the city's $78,791 median income, according to Boston Indicators, a research project from the nonprofit The Boston Foundation.",
            "\"I'm asking all of us to accept this responsibility as our own and commit to fighting racism, our deepest moral obligation,” Walsh said during his final State of the City address this month. “That's our greatest opportunity for growth. No city is better prepared than Boston to meet this moment.\"",
            "And tensions are high between police and protesters. Bodycam footage recorded during the George Floyd protests showed Boston police officers shoving protesters and spraying them with pepper spray. In one video, an officer appeared to brag about hitting protesters with his cruiser.",
            "Walsh, an Irish-American former labor leader, is leaving the city at a time when the face of Boston politics is changing rapidly. In a matter of years, the city elected a record number of women of color — including Rep. Ayanna Pressley and Suffolk County District Attorney Rachael Rollins — and the most diverse City Council in Boston history.",
            "The city is already on track to make history well before an election is held: If confirmed as labor secretary, Walsh's resignation will elevate Council President Kim Janey to acting mayor. Janey would be the first woman and first Black Bostonian to lead the city, and is considering running for a full term. The 2021 race provides another opportunity for change, candidates say.",
            "Boston City Council members Michelle Wu and Andrea Campbell launched campaigns in the fall, before it was clear that Walsh would leave the city. Now, more than a dozen state lawmakers, city councilors, law enforcement officials and City Hall employees — many of them Black or Latino — are also weighing campaigns. ",
            "\"Boston has a unique opportunity to confront its own painful history when it comes to race and racism, and to do the hard work of eradicating systemic inequities. But for us to do that we need to elect leadership that not only understands inequities, but has lived it,\" Campbell said in an interview.",
            "\"I give credit to the voters,\" added Campbell, who claims to have raised more money than any Black mayoral candidate in the city's history. \"For electing our district attorney and our congresswoman, diverse candidates that folks didn't think had a chance in winning their races. That momentum is only going to continue given the moment in time we're in.\"",
            "Boston has spent years confronting a long history of racism. The city was home to protests and violent clashes in the 1970s that stemmed from the desegregation of Boston public schools. ",
            "It's taken decades to change some of the city's best-known landmarks. Boston renamed Yawkey Way, the famous street outside Fenway Park, to Jersey Street in 2018. The street had been named after Red Sox owner Tom Yawkey, who resisted integrating the team in the 1950s. The Red Sox was the last baseball team to integrate. ",
            "Boston became a majority-minority city two decades ago, in the year 2000, according to the Boston Planning and Development Agency. As of 2015, Boston was 54.5 percent Hispanic or non-white. The city is also getting younger; the share of adults under the age of 34 is increasing in Boston.",
            "That change in demographics has translated over the last decade into the election of a more diverse slate of public officials in Boston. Slowly at first, then rapidly over the past few years. ",
            "Wu, who was recently endorsed by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), recalled her 2013 campaign for City Council, when the goal was to double the number of women on the Council from one to two. ",
            "\"To see just a few election cycles later — going from doubling from one to two, to swearing in the first-ever majority-women, majority-people of color Council in Boston after the 2019 elections — is a remarkable, fast shift in politics in our city,\" Wu said. ",
            "That sort of movement toward change may be harder to replicate in the mayoral race, however — especially during an off year. Without a congressional midterm or presidential contest to energize voters, the election will likely draw a smaller and different type of electorate. ",
            "\"In a mayoral election, you get a lot more of the traditional voters — people who work at City Hall, people who have families in the police or fire department, or in the redevelopment office. They may be older voters as well. So it's tough to get those voters to think about big picture issues,\" Suffolk University pollster David Paleologos said. \"In politics, usually we look at leaders as constituent services-type people or big picture people, and very few do both.\"",
            "In a city where politics is a pastime, it’s not unusual for an open mayoral race to draw a crowded field of candidates, making it costly and challenging to stand out from the other contenders. Walsh ran against 11 people in 2013. This will be only the second open mayoral race in 28 years. Walsh’s predecessor, Mayor Tom Menino, served for 20 years.",
            "But if Janey — the City Council president poised to take over as acting mayor — decides to seek a full term, she'll have the advantage of running as an incumbent. That worked in Menino's favor in the early 1990s. Menino became acting mayor after Mayor Ray Flynn was appointed U.S. ambassador to the Holy See by President Bill Clinton. Menino ran for a full term and was in office for two decades. ",
            "\"She will have the city machinery under her. That really is a great advantage to show accomplishments, to show leadership, to show that you can handle the job, which is all the things that Tom Menino did. There's risk, though,\" said Drew O'Brien of Burson Cohn & Wolfe, who worked on Menino's 1993 campaign. \"We're in a complicated political and governance situation.\"",
            "While the city’s changing demographics will draw a packed, diverse preliminary field, some political players worry it will reduce the chances that a candidate of color makes it to the general election. A similar vote-splitting result played out among progressives on Super Tuesday in Massachusetts, where left-of-center favorites Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren came in second and third place to Joe Biden. ",
            "That’s a real concern for Eldin Villafañe, of Boston's Barrales Public Affairs, who served as communications director on the campaign of the council’s first-ever Latina member, Julia Mejia.",
            "\"My fear is that, among Black and brown candidates that may be throwing their hat in the ring,” Villafañe said, “they will have a real Game of Thrones within our community.\""

            "We learned something about ourselves on that street corner in Minneapolis.",
            "2020 will go down for me as the year I did not travel to Minnesota.",
            "Strictly speaking, it is more accurate to say this was the year when I did not travel to my version of Minnesota. ",
            "My Minnesota is a crisp morning stroll in Northfield — which for decades has billed itself as the home of “Cows, Colleges, and Contentment” — while sipping a steaming cup to go from the Goodbye Blue Monday Coffee House on Division Street. This Minnesota is not so much state as state of mind. Another place I experience it is four hours north, near the western edge of the Mesabi Iron Range, on Pokegama Lake. If you are feeling lazy, you can sit on shore and listen to loons, or if you are feeling energetic, you can join the loons on the water with a canoe trip to Drumbeater Island.",
            "In a non-pandemic year, a combination of vacation and personal commitments would take me to the state perhaps four or five times in a year. People here are solid, sensible, a bit stoical, emphatically decent — the Minnesota of myth.",
            "As it happens, this year I did don my mask for a daylong work trip to the Minnesota of reality. That’s the state with Derek Chauvin’s knee on George Floyd’s neck. I spent 12 hours on the ground for an interview with Gov. Tim Walz about how he was managing the twin traumas of racial unrest and the coronavirus. Walz, an earnest and amiable fellow who is the first governor in 40 years not to come from the Twin Cities metropolitan area, is trying to lead a once-placid state that now vividly highlights the raw, pus-seeping, I-can’t-stand-you-either sores of the Trump Era. After leaving the governor’s residence on Summit Avenue in St. Paul, a few hundred yards from F. Scott Fitzgerald’s former home, I drove over to Minneapolis to the intersection where Floyd died. “No justice, no peace,” reads a sign at the makeshift monument that has taken over the intersection. ",
            "Before we delve into that reality, let’s linger a bit longer on myth. A myth is not synonymous with fiction. Those loons on the lake, and those nice people I encounter, actually exist. A myth is more like a distillation of reality, with the uncomfortable and unattractive parts filtered out. This leaves the pleasing and affirming parts in pure form, to lodge deeply in imagination and memory.",
            "Most people, in my experience, hold close some mythical destination that is similar to what Minnesota is to me. Perhaps it is Fenway Park, or some diner where the pancakes taste amazing at 3 a.m. in a booth with friends. People from Arkansas like to boast of the biggest watermelons you can possibly imagine. Do you remember what it smells like in your hometown after a sudden summer storm? This is about the crossroads of physical place with internal values, where it is possible to conceive and experience some better version of ourselves.",
            "The great national story of 2020, wherever one lives, was the collision of myth and reality. The American mythology is of an exceptional leader among nations. This year’s reality was exceptionalism of the wrong kind, leading in absolute terms in coronavirus infections and deaths, and with a deplorable record even in relative terms as a percent of population. Our shared story, taught to children and commonly embraced by adults, is that we are on the surface a nation of ornery individualists but underneath are the kind of people who put differences aside and pull together when it really matters. Hmm ... Do you think so?",
            "This points to what one hopes will be the great story of 2021. That is to prove that our national myths, while plainly not fully real, are at least not fully fraudulent. How does a country recover from lost innocence? A good place to start is to recall that innocence was never really there to be lost.",
            "It is on this point that Minnesota is a fine case study. This is true in part because — unlike many Southern states, which were stained from the start by slavery — it is not immediately obvious that this Northern state, with a reputation for Scandinavian-influenced progressivism and civic virtue, might have historic stains of its own.",
            "A disclaimer: I’m not actually a Minnesotan. I grew up in western New York, and, though I don’t really think of myself as a Washingtonian, have spent well more than half my life living in the District or the city Alexandria, Va., just across the Potomac. Funny, then, that I often feel as at home in Minnesota as in any place. My father grew up on the Iron Range in Hibbing (just a few blocks away from a boy, eight years younger, who was then known as Robert Zimmerman and later Bob Dylan.) My summers from a young age often brought a trip to Pokegama, in Grand Rapids. Later came four years in Northfield (at Carleton, one of two colleges, along with St. Olaf, invoked in the cows, colleges and contentment slogan.)",
            "In 1973, Time Magazine immortalized the state’s romantic conception of itself with a cover that proclaimed, “The Good Life in Minnesota.” It featured the ruddy-faced Democratic governor, Wendell Anderson, in a flannel shirt, holding a freshly caught northern pike. Time’s writer declared, “Some of the nation's more agreeable qualities are evident there: courtesy and fairness, honesty, a capacity for innovation, hard work, intellectual adventure and responsibility.” Garrison Keillor gave this congenial interpretation a satirical spin with his stories about “Lake Wobegon,” the prairie town “where all the women are strong, all the men are good-looking, and all the children are above average.\"",
            "How does one go from this version of Minnesota to the version of 2020, when Floyd’s killing on May 25 produced spasms of protests and rioting that left large swaths of Minneapolis boarded up for months after? The answer is with far more continuity in the threads of history than one might suppose.",
            "The state, like most places in the United States, was built in part on a foundation of violence and racial animus. My cousins grew up in the small southern Minnesota town of Mankato — where in 1862, the federal government carried out the largest single-day mass execution in American history. The hangings of 38 Native Americans were approved by none other than President Abraham Lincoln, as part of the conflict between the U.S. Army and the Dakota tribe in the state, then four years into statehood. ",
            "In Northfield, the town celebrates its brave 1876 defeat of the Jesse James Gang with a campy festival and reenactment. But as my college classmate, historian T.J. Stiles, illuminated in an acclaimed biography of James, the story of the James-Younger gang shouldn’t be understood through a prism of Old West romanticism. Though sometimes sentimentalized as a plucky American Robin Hood, James was motivated not just by greed but also by racial hatred and fury over the North’s victory in the Civil War. The Northfield townspeople, some of whom lost their lives in the raid, were able to defeat the invading gang because many of them carried guns and well knew how to use them. They surely would not have described themselves as innocents. ",
            "Nor would the Minnesotans who engaged in, or helped suppress, violent labor unrest in Minneapolis in the 1930s, or racial unrest in the 1960s. These people may not have recognized Donald Trump as a political type— his personality is a product of modern media — but they would not have been shocked by what now is called “polarization,” or the reality of pervasive malice, identity politics or contempt for the established order that now often defines public life.",
            "A certain laconic style is one dimension of the classic Minnesota character. My father, now deceased, was a surgeon, but in summers while a student he worked in the iron mines. He once told me of riding to the mines with older men, people he knew in one context as family friends. But in this context he was emphatically their junior, and they barely spoke a word as they drove to work. Silence, in its own way, can convey authority as powerfully as words.",
            "Stoicism, however, sometimes can muffle important truths. Perhaps no surprise, then, that another part of the Minnesota tradition is artists who respond to the stolid exterior of life by penetrating deeply to the contradictions, hypocrisy, and terror that can lie beneath ordinary exteriors. In different ways that is the achievement of such Minnesotans as Sinclair Lewis, who turned his bleak prairie upbringing into the novel “Main Street,” or Fitzgerald, or contemporary authors like Tim O’Brien, who grew up in Worthington, or musicians like Dylan or Prince, who died four years too early to see the streets of his native Minneapolis erupt this summer.",
            "There are times, as in 2020, when events shine a glaring light on the gap between professed ideals and life as it is really lived. One response to this exposure is to conclude that the ideals were always a fraud and the mythologies that sustained them are a part of the problem. Another response is to accept paradox as part of our national character, and try anew to narrow the gap between aspiration and achievement. In Minnesota, as in America, myths can serve a useful purpose."

        "title": " Biden’s big challenge: A growing racial wealth gap",
        "body": [
            "Black voters had Joe Biden’s back. Now he must prove he’s got theirs. ",
            "When he takes office on Jan. 20, Joe Biden will face a gap between Black and white wealth that has grown into a yawning chasm during the past 10 months. ",
            "The pandemic has shuttered tens of thousands of businesses and left millions out of work. And communities of color have borne the brunt of the economic devastation, particularly Black-owned businesses that have failed at a far greater rate during the pandemic than white-owned businesses. Many that remain may not survive the current pandemic wave without significant help from the federal government before effective vaccines finally arrive. ",
            "Biden’s presidency may rise or fall on his ability to execute policies — possibly with a GOP majority in the Senate — that address systemic economic inequality, which often leaves Black families and businesses far more vulnerable to economic shocks. Black families have faced a well-documented pattern of financial discrimination that has stymied their ability to accumulate wealth at the same rate as white families, forcing them to live in neighborhoods with fewer resources. For example, they are denied loans at much higher rates than white families with similar credit profiles — and face higher interest rates when they do qualify. ",
            "Biden won the White House with enormous help from African American voters, which he acknowledged in his victory speech: “The African American community stood up again for me. They always have my back, and I’ll have yours.”",
            "Now, his supporters say, he must deliver. ",
            "“Had it not been for Black people it would have been difficult for [Biden] to win,” said Ron Busby, president, CEO and founder of the U.S. Black Chambers. Busby said the pandemic exposed inequalities that have long existed: Black people were more likely to get the virus and die from it, more likely to be forced to go into work and less likely to be eligible for federal stimulus programs designed to prop up the economy. ",
            "“We’ve got to fix that and hold this administration accountable so we can provide opportunities for our own,” he said. ",
            "People close to the Biden transition team say targeting the higher rate of Black-owned business failures — and the racial wealth gap more broadly — will be a central focus of the new administration. Early measures to target the problem will likely include language in any new stimulus package aimed at making sure money from the Paycheck Protection Program, which is focused on aiding small businesses, goes to firms that may not have gotten access to previous funds, especially minority-owned businesses.",
            "“The administration really needs to think creatively to make sure aid gets to some of these small businesses that have been hit so hard,” one person close to the transition said on condition they not be identified because they were not authorized to speak publicly. “We can’t leave them behind. It’s got to be better than what happened before.”",
            "Despite Biden’s intentions, he’ll face significant roadblocks, including a divided Congress, a range of pressing priorities and a problem that has deep historical roots. New census data out this week showed white households with median wealth of $171,000 compared with $25,000 for Hispanic households and $9,567 for Black households in 2017. That gap has only widened among people with college education: Families headed by a college-educated Black person saw their wealth decline by nearly half compared with families headed by a college-educated white person between 1989 and 2016, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. ",
            "“The Biden administration can certainly begin to do this work and begin to support policies that will eliminate racism and discrimination in our economy,” said Rep. Maxine Waters, (D-Calif.) who chairs the House Financial Services Committee. Waters said that more banks and other financial institutions have been receptive to addressing the wealth gap and ending lending discrimination since George Floyd’s death in May. “But it certainly is not something that in a few months or a few years, all of a sudden, he’s going to be able to wipe away all the instances and ways by which inequality has grown and developed.”",
            "Many federal government programs created in the stimulus package are set to expire at the end of the year including an eviction moratorium, enhanced unemployment benefits and the Paycheck Protection Program. Black business owners and worker groups say they were largely shut out of the $2 trillion CARES Act. ",
            "From April to June of this year, 13 percent of jobless Black workers received unemployment benefits, compared with 22 percent for Hispanic workers and 24 percent for white workers, according to analysis from Nyanya Browne and William Spriggs at Howard University. (Their analysis was based on survey data from the National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago.)",
            "Spriggs, also chief economist at the AFL-CIO, said Black people are more likely to work in service industry jobs not covered by unemployment assistance programs and live in Southern states that were slow to roll out benefits. He said that to address the imbalance Congress and the new administration would have to redesign unemployment insurance programs instead of just renewing the current program when it lapses at the end of this year. ",
            "“We are going to have a long period of a very disrupted labor market,” Spriggs said. “They have to think, ‘Am I just going to patch this up? Or do I conceive of something different.’” If all they do is put it back together, Spriggs said, they’ll just end up replicating existing inequities. ",
            "In addition PPP funds haven’t reached Black businesses owners, which have been especially hard hit because of pandemic related shutdowns and a drop in demand. Between February and April of this year, 41 percent of Black-owned businesses closed, compared with 17 percent of white businesses, according to the New York Federal Reserve.",
            "That’s likely because Black-owned businesses often have thinner financial cushions. According to Goldman Sachs, 43 percent of Black-owned businesses expect cash reserves to be gone by the end of this year without more stimulus from Washington. Overall, that number is 30 percent. ",
            "But the problem with using PPP is that the program relies on banks as intermediaries to distribute capital. And Black-owned businesses often don’t have relationships with banks participating in the program.",
            "“There are things implicit in PPP that are detrimental to Black businesses,” said Darrick Hamilton, founding director of the Institute for the Study of Race, Stratification, and Political Economy at The New School. “Using banks as an intermediary won’t help if you don’t have a strong relationship with a commercial bank. It’s a justice issue. Black people should have the same access to capital as white people.”",
            "Hamilton suggested the administration focus on direct grants to heavily impacted minority-owned businesses, either through new legislation or through the Small Business Administration.",
            "Breaking up big companies is another area progressive economists want the Biden administration to pursue. Outside of going after big tech giants the president didn’t like, the Trump administration did not prioritize legally targeting some of the nation’s largest and most dominant companies such as Amazon and Facebook. But those who study the racial wealth gap suggest that the concentration of growth in a smaller number of very large companies is a critical factor in driving inequality.",
            "“For small businesses to thrive you need to have a robust antitrust agenda,” said Heather Boushey, president and CEO of the Washington Center for Equitable Growth. “It’s a super important and under-recognized factor. There is lots of empirical evidence that these things are connected.” ",
            "The Biden administration can also take steps to address the wealth gap even if Congress doesn’t cooperate. One way to tackle it is through federal contracting. Federal officials could reverse a Trump administration policy of not sharing which firms get federal funds and reinstate an Obama administration policy of paying suppliers upfront for contracts. ",
            "John Rogers, co-CEO of Ariel Investments, said there should be more transparency around how federal funds are spent. The federal government should track contracts by race and category to ensure that Black-owned businesses are getting deals for professional services — and not just contracts for janitorial or other low-margin industries. What’s more, Rogers said, the administration should use their bully pulpit to ensure private companies are doing the same. ",
            "When the state of Illinois mandated diversity in company boards, more Black executives benefited from new opportunities, Rogers said. ",
            "“A lot of companies had a Jackie Robinson moment,” he said. But even forcing companies to be transparent about who gets contracts and sits on boards can create more diversity. ",
            "“Then pressure builds to move into the 21st century,” Rogers said. “And do the right thing.”"

        "body": [
            "Black Lives Matter leaders turned out the vote. Now they want a piece of the political action.\n",
            "This is the year Black Lives Matter grew from a grassroots, ad-hoc agitator to a potential political powerhouse. And with Joe Biden as president-elect, its leaders are seeking to expand their influence beyond the streets — and into the corridors of Washington. ",
            "The summer of protests against racial injustice and police violence brought millions to the streets under the banner of Black Lives Matter. It also gave the international movement significant corporate and political muscle, which leaders used to launch a nationwide voter mobilization effort, registering and turning out millions of first-time voters. Armed with an infusion of cash, they launched a political action committee in October — a move that signals their readiness to deal in the mainstream political arena. ",
            "Next on their agenda: Barnstorming Georgia to get out the vote for the Senate runoffs on Jan. 5. The control of the Senate is on the line and with it, any hopes for the sweeping reforms of the Black Lives Matter political agenda. ",
            "“The ballot is actually an essential tool to our movement,” Black Lives Matter co-founder Patrisse Cullors said in an interview. “We are both marching and protesting. And we are going to the voting booth. Those are multiple tools in our toolbox to change our system.”",
            "But changing the system won’t be easy. As an organization, Black Lives Matter deliberately eschews a central leadership infrastructure, which makes forming consensus around their policy goals more complicated. It doesn’t help, either, that there is growing animosity among Democrats toward the movement. Many blame calls to defund the police — one of activists’ central talking points — for their down ballot losses. Meanwhile, Black Lives Matter leaders argue Democrats aren’t pushing hard enough with criminal justice reform, coronavirus relief and a major police funding overhaul. ",
            "\"Black Lives Matter, through media and social media, can organize marches all across the world,” said Illinois Rep. Bobby Rush, a former Black Panther. “However, can Black Lives Matter get a bill passed in the House of Representatives? No, I don’t think so.\"",
            "The BREATHE Act is one example of this dynamic in play. In July, leaders with the Movement for Black Lives, a coalition of more than 50 social justice organizations affiliated with the Black Lives Matter movement, unveiled the four-part legislative proposal, which calls for mitigating police violence through divestment from law enforcement and investment in communities of color. The proposal was backed by Reps. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) and Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.), but efforts to get it on the DNC platform in August failed. It remains atop the movement’s list of legislative priorities.",
            "The George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, drafted in response to the police killings of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, represents Democrats’ efforts to meet protesters’ demands halfway. The bipartisan bill, introduced by Congressional Black Caucus chair Karen Bass (D-Calif.), would end qualified immunity in civil rights suits against police, form national standards for officers' use of force and establish a database to track officer offenses. It passed the House in June and is unlikely to pass the Senate, which drafted its own unsuccessful version. ",
            "Jessica Byrd, a political strategist and lead organizer with the Movement for Black Lives, said the bill is a positive sign but “not enough,” because it does not address police budgets or the harm wrought on overpoliced communities, which tend to be communities of color.",
            "“The idea that you need to make murder illegal when murder is already illegal, is ridiculous,” Byrd said. “We aren't going to take our eyes off of that. And we're not going to allow people to tinker around the edges and tell us that it's progress.”",
            "In the weeks leading up to Election Day, lead organizers with the Movement for Black Lives strategized how they would respond to its outcome. ",
            "If Joe Biden lost, leaders and strategists said, they planned to focus on local races, fighting to elect reform-minded mayors, city and county commissioners. If he won, they would spend the first 100 days of his administration urging him to enact reforms that millions of protesters had been calling for in the streets. ",
            "Hours after the presidential race was called, Cullors sent Biden and Kamala Harris a letter requesting a meeting. In it, Cullors made it clear that she and movement leaders intended to hold their administration accountable to their demands. ",
            "“We want to be heard and our agenda to be prioritized,” Cullors wrote. “We issue these expectations not just because Black people are the most consistent and reliable voters for Democrats, but also because Black people are truly living in crisis in a nation that was built on our subjugation.”",
            "Leaders with the Movement for Black Lives say they plan to push the Biden-Harris administration to immediately end cash bail and grant amnesty to protesters targeted by the National Guard under President Trump. Any stimulus bill Congress passes, they argue, should specifically provide relief to the Black, Latino and Native communities disproportionately impacted by the coronavirus. ",
            "In the meantime, Cullors said she’s yet to hear back from Biden or Harris.",
            "Tlaib, who supports Black Lives Matter, said she is optimistic about the chances of police reform passing under a Biden administration. The Black Lives Matter movement will not let up on pressuring a Biden administration, she said. ",
            "“Growing up in Detroit and one of the most beautiful blackest cities in the country, one thing it taught me is that transformative change happens when we organize in the streets and it reaches Congress and it reaches the White House,” said Tlaib. “I'm an extension of that movement work.”",
            "This year, the movement helped secure a number of electoral wins, which, its leaders say, proves their political value to the Democratic Party. The height of the Black Lives Matter protests over the summer brought a surge in Democratic voter registrations by about 2 million, according to an analysis by TargetSmart. In addition to galvanizing record turnout in predominantly Black cities like Milwaukee, Philadelphia and Detroit, organizers in Georgia helped register more than 800,000 new voters to help deliver the state for Biden. ",
            "In January, they’ll be sending one of their own to Congress. Cori Bush, a nurse from Ferguson, Mo., will be the first Black Lives Matter activist elected to national office. Two other progressive candidates heading for Washington, Jamaal Bowman (D-N.Y.) and Ritchie Torres (D-NY), are progressive allies of the movement. ",
            "What’s more, nearly a dozen major cities also elected progressive district attorneys, including Los Angeles, where incumbent Jackie Lacey was unseated by George Gascón, who ran on a platform promising to stop trying juveniles as adults and end the death penalty. In St. Louis, Kim Gardner, a circuit attorney who was among those who ran with the backing of the Black Lives Matter movement, said that protests in the city in the wake of the police killings of Floyd and Taylor “energized voters to vote and understand that these local prosecutor elections are important.”",
            "“It reaffirmed the accountability of local prosecutors as well as the activist community to make sure they hold electeds accountable for what we know needs to be reformed,” Gardner said, citing police accountability as one of the top issues she’s vowed to address. ",
            "Any chance for Democrats to pass sweeping reforms, however, hinges largely on their control of the Senate, which is why Black Lives Matter activists are planning to travel to Georgia in the coming weeks. Democrats face considerable odds in flipping both Senate seats blue. That won’t stop their lobbying, said Maurice Mitchell, director of the Working Families Party, during a press call last week.",
            "“Clearly, if [Mitch] McConnell is in control of the Senate, we anticipate that there will be some obstruction there,” Mitchell said. “But we're going to — on the local, state and federal level — continue to push our demands, and then call on [Biden] to do the things that the president could do even without the ability to pull on the levers of the legislature.”",
            "Biden has recognized the role that Black voters played in his election and promised to return the favor in his presidential victory speech. His “Lift Every Voice” plan for Black America aims to address racial disparities in health, the economy, education and criminal justice. His approach to police reform involves reinvestment in the COPS program, which calls for police departments to hire officers that reflect the racial diversity of their communities — a stark contrast from the invest-divest framework activists have been calling for. His office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
            "Still, experts maintain that Black Lives Matter has already made significant inroads even if they are not immediately noticeable. In the long run, some argue, any legislation passed may very likely have its roots in the movement work completed this year.",
            "“Biden and Harris can advocate for major reforms of policing while still appearing moderate by saying they oppose defunding the police,” said Omar Wasow, an assistant professor of politics at Princeton University. “For some more militant activists, this might seem like a failure. But if Biden and Harris have been pulled further towards more significant reforms by the Black Lives Matter protests, then the activism made an important difference.”",
            "Yet, there are still concerns that the movement’s gains could diminish even after the summer of protest, despite the bolstered national profile and increased support. Rush said he envisions a future in which Black Lives Matter, if it continues on its current trajectory, becomes “its own political apparatus” that will in turn make it “more compromising in its goals and in its virtues.”",
            "“It happens all the time in every social movement,” Rush explained. “Every social movement carries with it the seeds of its own disintegration or its own disempowerment … [activists] become less relevant as agents of change. That’s just the reality. They gotta go through that.” ",
            "Still, Rush said, he feels that even as the movement’s influence waxes and wanes, he’s still optimistic about the progress made.",
            "“You can stop a revolutionary but you can’t stop the revolution,” Rush said, invoking the words of his late comrade Fred Hampton. “Revolutionaries have a short lifespan. Revolutionary organizations have a short lifespan. Revolutions don’t.” ",

            "Hennepin County Judge Peter Cahill ruled after defense attorneys had argued that pretrial publicity had made it impossible for the four men to get a fair trial in Minneapolis. They had also cited a Sept. 11 hearing in which the men and their attorneys were confronted by angry protesters outside the courthouse, saying it showed that holding the proceeding in the same area where Floyd died would be unsafe for participants. Defense lawyers had argued that witnesses could be intimidated, and jurors could be affected by chants from a crowd outside.",
            "But Cahill said he was unpersuaded at the moment that moving the trial would improve security, and that he believes the jury can be protected from outside influences.",
            "“No corner of the State of Minnesota has been shielded from pretrial publicity regarding the death of George Floyd. Because of that pervasive media coverage, a change of venue is unlikely to cure the taint of potential prejudicial pretrial publicity,” he wrote.",
            "Cahill said he was willing to revisit the issue later if circumstances warrant. Moving the trial away from Minneapolis to a less diverse area of the state also likely would affect the makeup of the jury, though the judge didn't address that issue. In a separate order, however, he said the names of the jurors will be kept confidential.",
            "The judge also ruled in another order that the trial can be televised and streamed live from the courtroom.",
            "Defense attorneys had also argued that the men should face separate trials, as each officer tried to diminish their own role in Floyd’s arrest by pointing fingers at the other. But Cahill rejected that too, saying the complications of separate trials were too great and that trying the officers together would “ensure that the jury understands ... all of the evidence and the complete picture of Floyd's death.",
            "“And it would allow this community, this State and the nation to absorb the verdicts for the four defendants at once,” he concluded.",
            "Floyd, a Black man in handcuffs, died May 25 after Derek Chauvin, who is white, pressed his knee against Floyd’s neck as he said he couldn’t breathe. Floyd’s death sparked protests in Minneapolis and beyond, and led to a nationwide reckoning on race. All four officers were fired. They are scheduled to stand trial in March.",
            "Chauvin is charged with unintentional second-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. The three other former officers, Thomas Lane, J. Kueng and Tou Thao, are charged with aiding and abetting both counts.",
            "Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, whose office is prosecuting the case, said in a statement that the rulings “represent another significant step forward” in the pursuit of justice for Floyd and the community.",
            "“The murder of George Floyd occurred in Minneapolis and it is right that the defendants should be tried in Minneapolis,” Ellison said. “It is also true that they acted in concert with each other and the evidence against them is similar, so it is right to try them in one trial.”"

De Blasio and Police Commissioner Dermot Shea drew widespread condemnation for police aggression during the demonstrations.",
            "“The police response to the protests was brutal, and the wanton display of brute force against people who were out there protesting non-violently was shocking,” NYCLU executive director Donna Lieberman said in an interview. “It was harmful. It was traumatic. And it was unlawful.”",
            "News of the lawsuit was first reported by POLITICO.",
            "Eleven plaintiffs named in the complaint say that while participating in protests between May 28 and June 28, they were beaten with batons, hit with pepper spray or subjected to “kettling” — a tactic in which police hemmed in and charged protesters. One protester’s arm was broken.",
            "Some protesters said they were arrested and jailed without food, water or medical care, in crowded conditions that put them at risk for Covid-19. They also say police failed to wear masks as required by state law.",
            "The suit charges that de Blasio, who publicly defended the NYPD’s response to the protests, maintained a de facto policy of allowing police officers to violently target protesters by approving forceful deployments and failing to discipline officers for their actions. In addition to the mayor, Shea and Chief of Department Terence Monahan are named as defendants.",
            "“The Mayor of New York and the NYPD’s leadership condoned and even promoted that violence,” the lawsuit says. “As the protests continued and well documented, indisputable patterns of unlawful use of force emerged, the Mayor, the Commissioner, and Chief Monahan deliberately did not take steps to prevent police from using those tactics again and again. Instead, they repeatedly praised the actions of the NYPD, promoting, authorizing, sanctioning and encouraging further violence.”",
            "De Blasio instituted a curfew in the city for the first time in decades in response to incidents of looting and vandalism.",
            "In the face of outcry over police officers using force to disperse peaceful protesters, including from many of his own former aides and supporters, de Blasio mostly defended the NYPD — maintaining that the police force “uses as light a touch as possible,” though he acknowledged he had not seen widely circulated videos of cops rushing protesters and striking them with batons.",
            "“He’s the apologist in chief,” Lieberman said.",
            "The suit says the attacks on protesters were directed by NYPD supervising officers, including the highest ranks of police leadership, and carried out in retaliation for the demonstrators’ anti-police message.",
            "The actions of de Blasio, Monahan and Shea \"constitute a City policy to engage in excessive force, discriminate on the basis of viewpoint against those fighting for greater police accountability for brutality, and retaliate against people engaged in their constitutionally protected right to protest,\" the suit says.",
            "The NYPD said it would review the suit. The mayor's office did not respond to a request for comment.",
            "Bronx resident Vidal Guzman, one of the plaintiffs, said he was pepper sprayed in the face while protesting on the Lower East Side at the end of May and fell to the ground when hit with the spray, injuring his leg.",
            "“A lot of people got injured that day,” he said. “It felt more like World War III, and the people they were going against were their own citizens.”",
            "The suit asks a judge to rule that the city violated the First Amendment, which protects the right to protest, and the Fourth Amendment, which protects against unreasonable search and seizure, and to award damages to the plaintiffs."

            "BIRMINGHAM, Ala. — Alabama voters once again have the chance to remove the racist language of Jim Crow from the state's constitution, which was approved in 1901 to enshrine white supremacy as state law.",
            "Courts have long since struck down legalized segregation, but past attempts to strip the offensive phrases have failed. Even though no organized opposition to the measure has emerged this time, some worry that conservative backlash to the Black Lives Matter movement could quash the proposal, which qualified for the ballot months before the nationwide demonstrations that occurred in the wake of the police killing of George Floyd.",
            "A measure on the Nov. 3 ballot would allow the state to recompile its 119-year-old constitution in a process supporters say would remove a lingering stain from the state's era of racial segregation and the legalized oppression of Black people.",
            "“What we are trying to do with this small measure is to bring the Alabama Constitution into the 21st century and be more reflective of who we are as a state now,” said Rep. Merika Coleman, one of the sponsors of the bipartisan legislation.",
            "An amendment would clear the way for excising language from the constitution that bans mixed-race marriages, allows poll taxes, and mandates school segregation. It would also remove duplicate sections from the heavily amended document and put related items all in one section.",
            "While eradicating overt racism might seem like a logical move in 2020, approval isn't a given: Voters in the majority white, conservative state have rejected similar proposals twice since 2000.",
            "In 2004, conservatives helped kill a move to clean up the constitution by arguing the move could lead to increases in school taxes. Eight years later, education groups and others opposed a similar measure because it retained segregation-era language that denied the constitutional right to education in Alabama.",
            "Supporters of the measure are being careful with how they present the issue this year.",
            "Called Amendment 4, the proposal as written on statewide ballots does not even mention race. It just says the amendment would let the Legislature “recompile the Alabama Constitution and submit it during the 2022 Regular Session, and provide a process for its ratification by the voters ....\"",
            "Supporters are encouraged because no organized opposition has emerged just days ahead of the vote. But they are also wary that conservatives who dominate the state electorate could oppose the amendment if they perceive it as being tied to anti-racism protests.",
            "“It’s possible that the backlash will rear its head and people will vote against it,” said Nancy Ekberg, a director of Alabama Citizens for Constitutional Reform, a nonprofit that has been pushing for a rewrite for 20 years.",
            "Coleman said there was no connection between the amendment and nationwide protests against racial injustice.",
            "“I don’t understand how anyone would conflate the two issues when we passed the measure in 2019 and it was completely bipartisan,” she said.",
            "The racial justice movement and remnants of racism are tied to measures in some other states. Voters in neighboring Mississippi will decide on a replacement for the Confederate-themed state flag, and Rhode Island voters will decide whether to remove a reference to plantations from the state's official name.",
            "In Alabama, history shows there's reason for supporters of the amendment to worry.",
            "Two decades ago, Alabama voters voted to repeal an unenforceable section of the constitution that made it illegal for Black and white people to marry. About 40% voted against the change, and the amendment either passed narrowly or lost in many rural, mostly white counties.",
            "If voters OK a reworking this year, a final version of the document would still have to be approved by lawmakers and in another statewide vote in 2022.",
            "Republican Gov. Kay Ivey has not taken an official position on the anti-racist measure or any of the five other statewide amendments on the ballot, but she does not oppose any of them, said spokeswoman Gina Maiola.",
            "The 1901 constitution was written to establish a \"rigid apartheid” in Alabama, and the white men who wrote it were successful in disenfranchising Black people and poor white people for generations, said historian Wayne Flynt. Large numbers of Black people did not register to vote until after the civil rights gains of the 1960s.",
            "Flynt said someone — including a state competing for an economic development project — could use the remaining racist language in the constitution to argue that “nothing in Alabama has changed.”",
            "“This referendum and the referendum in ’22 will be a way of opening up the soul of Alabama and see what it looks like on the inside,” Flynt said."

            "Barrett, who has a Black son and daughter adopted from Haiti, was asked in the second day of her confirmation hearing about the viral video of Floyd dying at the hands of Minneapolis police in May. His death sparked months of nationwide unrest and calls for police reforms, including calls to defund the police.",
            "\"All of this was erupting and it was very difficult for her,\" Barrett said of her 17-year-old daughter Vivian's response to the deadly encounter.",
            "“Senator, as you might imagine, given that I have two Black children, that was very, very personal for my family,” Barrett told Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), who had asked whether she had seen the video. The judge explained that while her husband had taken her sons on a camping trip that weekend, she and Vivian “wept together in my room” as outrage over Floyd’s death mushroomed and consumed the country. ",
            "Barrett noted that Floyd’s death and the ensuing unrest were also difficult for her 10-year-old daughter, Juliette, who is white.",
            "“I had to try to explain some of this to them,” she told the committee. “I mean my children — to this point in their lives — have had the benefit of growing up in a cocoon where they have not yet experienced hatred or violence. And for Vivian to understand that there would be a risk to her brother or the son she might have one day of that kind of brutality has been an ongoing conversation.” ",
            "Floyd, who is Black and was unarmed, was killed when a police officer leaned with his knee on Floyd’s neck for nearly nine minutes while Floyd lay handcuffed on the street. ",
            "Barrett added that the resulting conversation has been “a difficult one for us like it is for Americans all over the country.” ",

            "“I think it is an entirely uncontroversial and obvious statement, given as we have just talked about the George Floyd video, that racism persists in our country,” Barrett replied, but added that addressing the issue was a matter of policy."

            "LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) — Hours after a Kentucky grand jury brought no charges against Louisville police for Breonna Taylor’s death and protesters took to the streets, authorities said two officers were shot and wounded Wednesday night during the demonstrations expressing anger over the killings of Black people at the hands of police.",
            "Interim Louisville Police Chief Robert Schroeder said a suspect was in custody but did not offer details about whether that person was participating in the demonstrations. He says both officers are expected to recover, and one is undergoing surgery.",
            "He says the officers were shot after investigating reports of gunfire at an intersection where there was a large crowd.",
            "Several shots rang out as protesters in downtown Louisville tried to avoid police blockades, moving down an alleyway as officers lobbed pepper balls, according to an Associated Press journalist. People covered their ears, ran away and frantically looked for places to hide. Police with long guns swarmed the area, then officers in riot gear and military-style vehicles blocked off roadways.",
            "The violence comes after prosecutors said two officers who fired their weapons at Taylor, a Black woman, were justified in using force to protect themselves after they faced gunfire from her boyfriend. The only charges were three counts of wanton endangerment against fired Officer Brett Hankison for shooting into a home next to Taylor’s with people inside.",
            "The FBI is still investigating potential violations of federal law in connection with the raid at Taylor’s home on March 13.",
            "Ben Crump, a lawyer for Taylor’s family, denounced the decision as “outrageous and offensive,” and protesters shouting, “No justice, no peace!” immediately marched through the streets.",
            "Scuffles broke out between police and protesters, and some were arrested. Officers fired flash bangs and a few small fires burned in a square that’s been at the center of protests, but it had largely cleared out ahead of a nighttime curfew as demonstrators marched through other parts of downtown Louisville. Dozens of patrol cars blocked the city’s major thoroughfare.",
            "Demonstrators also marched in cities like New York, Chicago, Washington, D.C., Atlanta and Philadelphia.",
            "Taylor, an emergency medical worker, was shot multiple times by white officers who entered her home during a narcotics investigation. State Attorney General Daniel Cameron said that while the officers had a no-knock warrant, the investigation showed they announced themselves before entering. The warrant used to search her home was connected to a suspect who did not live there, and no drugs were found inside.",
            "Along with the killing of George Floyd in Minnesota, Taylor’s case became a major touchstone for nationwide protests that have drawn attention to entrenched racism and demanded police reform. Taylor’s image has been painted on streets, emblazoned on protest signs and silk-screened on T-shirts worn by celebrities. Several prominent African American celebrities joined those urging that the officers be charged.",
            "The announcement drew sadness, frustration and anger that the grand jury did not go further. The wanton endangerment charges each carry a sentence of up to five years.",

            "“Those that are currently feeling frustration, feeling hurt, they deserve to know more,” he said.",
            "The case exposed the wide gulf between public opinion on justice for those who kill Black Americans and the laws under which those officers are charged, which regularly favor police and do not often result in steep criminal accusations.",
            "At a news conference, Cameron spoke to that disconnect: “Criminal law is not meant to respond to every sorrow and grief.”",
            "“But my heart breaks for the loss of Miss Taylor. ... My mother, if something was to happen to me, would find it very hard,” he added, choking up.",
            "But Cameron, who is the state’s first Black attorney general, said the officers acted in self-defense after Taylor’s boyfriend fired at them. He added that Hankison and the two other officers who entered Taylor’s apartment announced themselves before entering — and so did not execute the warrant as “no knock,” according to the investigation. The city has since banned such warrants.",
            "“According to Kentucky law, the use of force by (Officers Jonathan) Mattingly and (Myles) Cosgrove was justified to protect themselves,” he said. “This justification bars us from pursuing criminal charges in Miss Breonna Taylor’s death.”",
            "Cameron said an FBI crime lab determined that Cosgrove fired the bullet that killed Taylor.",
            "Taylor’s boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, opened fire when police burst in, hitting Mattingly. Walker told police he heard knocking but didn’t know who was coming in and fired in self-defense.",
            "Cameron, who is a Republican, is a protégé of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and has been tagged by some as his heir apparent. His was also one of 20 names on President Donald Trump’s list to fill a future Supreme Court vacancy.",

            "Gov. Tim Walz on leading the state where George Floyd’s killing set off a national reckoning on race and systemic inequity.",
            "ST. PAUL, Minn. — As the state where George Floyd died with a Minneapolis police officer’s knee on his neck, Minnesota in 2020 has endured trauma in ways that were beyond Gov. Tim Walz’s imagination.",
            "There is something else, however, that is entirely within his imagination: 2021 could easily be worse.",
            "The criminal prosecutions of Derek Chauvin and other Minneapolis police officers fired in the aftermath of the Floyd killing are scheduled to begin in March. With the Twin Cities having endured multiple spasms of rioting this past summer and spring, how much is Walz worried about the possibility of further unrest around the trials?",
            "“A lot,” Walz told POLITICO. “I think certainly if the verdict comes out a not guilty verdict on that, it will be challenging. And we need to not just think about it — which we’re doing — the physical security of it. It’s these conversations I’m in with Black leadership and trying to be out there.”",
            "Walz’s comments came in an interview for “The Fifty,” a POLITICO series exploring the intersection among states, cities and national politics. Walz spoke at a time when he’s making local decisions with decidedly national resonance, given the reckoning on race and systemic inequality that followed Floyd’s killing. Minnesota is a state that has regarded itself as exceptional for its congeniality and healthy civic culture but now finds instead that it is vividly emblematic of the rancor and institutional failures across the country.",
            "The governor’s reference to “trying to be out there” in “conversations” with critics is the essence of the Walz political style. The Democrat, a former teacher and member of Congress who won the governorship in 2018, believes he is a reasonable guy who, if he has a chance to sit down and chat with most folks, he can persuade them to be reasonable, too.",
            "Is Walz living in a fantasy? Or, more generously, in the past? Even Gwen Walz, the governor’s wife and a high school English teacher, sometimes worries that he is, at least when it comes to dealing with his Republican adversaries. By most evidence, they are little interested in helping Walz carry out the cheerful “One Minnesota” vision he campaigned on.",
            "“She’s a little more, ‘They mistake your kindness for weakness and don’t ever do that,'” Walz said of his spouse’s views about the yearning for a collegial bipartisan center she believes is illusion. “But I also think — especially when you’re in an executive position — I still believe our system of checks and balances and compromise created a better, fairer system that worked, and I do not see this oscillation amongst extremes being a better way of governing.” ",
            "On the surface, Walz’s words seem like a perfectly sensible approach for sensible Minnesota — a place that in its own mythology is uncommonly peaceful and progressive, a culturally centered place in the center of the nation. What happened in 2020 is a collision between that pleasant myth and starkly unpleasant reality. In 2020, the state has been violent, not peaceful. It may still tilt progressive, but there are agitated voices, rising steadily in volume, on both the left and right.",
            "This conflict between the self-conception of many Minnesotans and the actual facts of Minnesota life was the recurring theme of an hourlong conversation with the 56-year-old Walz. He’s not that great with Zoom, a staff aide warned. But the Minnesota governor’s residence on Summit Avenue — a few hundred yards down the street from where F. Scott Fitzgerald lived — has a spacious patio with plenty of room to distance. So an in-person interview it was, on a sunny but temperate late-summer day. While Walz talked in an unhurried way, his stocky black lab mix, Scout, sniffed and roamed with an impatient, proprietary air. ",
            "Extended excerpts of the interview are below. Highlights of Walz’s comments include:",
            "— Walz said the eruption of protests, some of which turned violent, in the wake of Floyd’s May 25 death can be understood only in the context of yearslong animosities between minorities and the Minneapolis police: “The faith between the police and those they govern is broken and vice versa. Neither one trusts the other and that creates an untenable situation.”",
            "— Walz believes polls saying Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden is up by as much as 7 percentage points in Minnesota, but he warns that President Donald Trump is capable of closing the gap. He said the unrest in the Twin Cities likely exacerbates animosity in “Greater Minnesota” toward the state’s urban core — a tension that is now a central dynamic of the state’s politics. Walz, from the southern Minnesota town of Mankato, is the first governor in 40 years not to come from the Twin Cities metro area. In rural areas, he said, the economic and cultural grievance he finds is palpable: “The [2008-2009] recession did not bounce back as quickly in rural areas. I think they had people telling them that, ‘Hey, the people in the cities are getting over on you.’ … And the president tells them and again, ‘Hey, it’s these folks. Put the blame on these folks in the cities. It’s these folks that are taking away your life,’ and I think people are frustrated.”",
            "— Minnesota’s self-perception of being racially progressive is sometimes a hurdle to honest discussion of systemic inequality: “I think there’s a racism we didn’t want to talk about. I heard a young woman, a mother, up in Duluth from Arkansas and she said, ‘The racism I’ve felt has been quieter but meaner.’ And that breaks my heart.” He quoted his lieutenant governor, Peggy Flanagan, the second Native American to be elected to statewide office in U.S. history, noting that “the Minnesota thing” to do when someone raises uncomfortable subjects is, “Well, let’s have pie and turn away from it.”",
            "— The budget fallout from the coronavirus pandemic is likely to shadow his entire term in office, and beyond. Walz noted a paradox in which both the coronavirus crisis and the Minneapolis protests have highlighted deep inequalities, especially in education, at precisely the moment when state resources are most scarce. ",
            "These excerpts have been edited for length and clarity.",
            "Has the “One Minnesota” theme that Walz ran on in 2018 been revealed by the George Floyd to be an unattainable idea?",
            "That is one where I think I was ahead of where the curve was going. I could feel this brewing. ... I’m a geographer, so I will forever curse the red-blue map people made back in 2000.",
            "There is this idea that greater Minnesota is somehow different than the Twin Cities area, and my take was that we were obviously — both as a state and as a nation — stronger together. And so I knew that these tensions were there. I knew that we had to try to heal them, and I ran on that idea and think now more than ever, it’s apparent if we don’t do that, we’re going to get ripped apart. I am not Pollyannaish. There are differences, but this whole idea is that [if the state isn’t unified] we work against our own economic self-interest. The reason Minnesota’s economy is so strong is we have a very vibrant Fortune 500 [base] centered here, which we have to protect. We have a medical device industry that’s the envy of the world. We also are leading producers of pork and turkeys and so those things benefit all of us, and so I think as far as an agenda piece of this, that unifying us together, moving us to an economy that continues to diversify. ",
            "But one of the issues I really focused on was this education piece. ... I’m a high school teacher, but I spent a lot of time with this, and the thing that was most troubling to me — and this is where the George Floyd stuff [comes in] — is the inequities that America has and kind of the systemic racisms. It's just here, it’s just the absolute epitome. What that ends up causing is you have a state that ranks first in educational attainment in public schools if you’re white, last if you’re not.",
            "Minnesota has a divided Legislature — the state Senate is Republican, and the House is Democratic. Walz said his first year of dealing with this split showed some progress.",
            "We did something last year that was — again, and you shouldn’t get patted on the back for stuff you’re supposed to do, but — our Legislature did a budget and at that time, we were the only divided Legislature in the country. … The first time in 40 years a governor hadn’t issued a veto and we did that together and there was compromise and I didn’t get [everything I wanted] in education and some of those . The first governor in 20 years that didn’t raise taxes. A Democratic governor, we cut taxes, and those things were kind of working.",
            "But Walz said the emergence of Covid-19 — which some initially predicted would transcend partisan divisions — has created a more polarized environment with GOP legislators fearing that Walz would use the crisis to amass power or shut down too much of the economy.",
            "Now, Covid has just driven the wedge in this and it’s to me, it’s frustrating because I think there’s legitimate budget discussions to this, but we’re in this place right now … that we couldn’t get a budget done and we couldn’t get our bonding bill done until I give up what every other state governor has; the use of emergency powers to be able to procure PPE and those types of things. They laid down a gauntlet that said, “Unless you give these things up, we’re not doing any of the rest of this.”... I, for one, have said you need to be very careful about the use of those emergency powers, but the president and all 50 states have determined that this pandemic is an emergency. … So I keep asking, “What would you like?” And I think the reality of this is they simply don’t believe that we should be doing anything around Covid. There should be no limitations on restaurants. There should be no mask mandate and we shouldn’t be testing. I’m getting pushback from legislators who are afraid I’m just going to test so I can keep schools closed. ",
            "I’m a schoolteacher. I’ve got a 13-year-old sitting up there. Trust me, no one in Minnesota wants their kid out of their house and in school more than me, but that’s where we’re at. …",
            "I don’t understand it from a political standpoint, but [the pandemic] played into that larger narrative that the other side is not only wrong; they’re bent on destroying something that’s important to you and I don’t know where that got into there. These are my relatives. The county where I grew up [in Nebraska] — and my mom still lives there on a farm — voted 93 percent for President Trump.",
            "How has 2020 changed Minnesotans’ view of their state?",
            "There’s — even if it’s at a low burn — anxiety still from George Floyd’s death, the fallout of that. And I think trying to understand how Minnesotans see this … there is a Minnesota exceptionalism that we espouse and we think we can back it up with some numbers, but hidden under that, which we all knew, were those achievements gaps, those racial gaps. Not that different than the rest of the country, but probably more exacerbated here. …",
            "We’re at the point now and I was at the point before George Floyd, but now that sense of urgency is there. We can no longer avoid that and they are wanting systemic fundamental change and I think that’s what you’re hearing and obviously the horrificness and the lack of humanity that went into the murder of George Floyd was one thing, but I think what you need to recognize — Minnesotans, maybe even more so than other places, especially Black Minnesotans and those who care about this — that pent up desire, we pushed a lot of this under the rug too long, and I think this is what you’re getting. …",
            "We envisioned ourselves as progressive, Scandinavian leaders and [yet] we left people behind and we left some communities of color behind, but I think [Trump] also capitalized that we had areas that were heavily dependent on industries that are going away, much like in Appalachia with the coal with some of the mining and the changes that are coming around.",
            "The POLITICO interview took place on Aug. 31. Two days earlier, Minneapolis had more protests, and some late-night rioting in defiance of curfews, after a Black man died in a police incident. It was not immediately clear that he had died by suicide rather than from police shooting. As he had done previously, Walz activated National Guard units under his command. He described his style for keeping abreast of events amid so much tension and the constant prospect of more unrest.",
            "I did not hear originally of the initial incident at 2 or so. It was the homicide, and the eventual suicide. But by about 5 in the afternoon or so, we started hearing a few things. The mayor of Minneapolis, Mayor [Jacob] Frey, contacted us a little before 7. So we’re checking … and I’m asking them what’s going on with this and then we all got together just shortly after 7. … What I learned from [the George Floyd protests in] May is how quickly these things can escalate. Social media helped spread that and the pain and the anger that was there mixes very quickly with lawlessness and those things and so we started immediately right then moving in our assets, the state patrol, and activation of the National Guard. …",
            "They give me the assessment of how many they think they need based on what we think is coming and those things start to go and then we’re up all night and we were on Wednesday night getting the updates as that started to play out and then planning for Thursday. The same thing last night. I was down at the State Emergency Operation Center until roughly 10 or so last night when it seemed like we had that. But a lot of flow of information through my agencies. This is a really unique situation where cities are responsible — primary responsibility for that security — but we saw that no city could have handled what Minneapolis saw those last few days of May and so we kind of had to rethink how do these relationships work, how do we talk about these mutual aid agreements and what is the state’s role?",
            "Those commanders — whether they’re the police commanders, the state patrol, or the National Guard — are making those [decisions] in the moment. They’re moving assets from street to street or whatever. It’s my responsibility if we’re going to activate more [National Guard]. ... If we’re going to need more or if that communication is not happening. One of the things we saw in May is being able to communicate and what the states really can do and where there was a big gap was fire suppression and that ended up causing a lot of the problems. And so those were decisions where we had those assets on standby and then they call me and … I say, “Yes, let’s move them. Let’s activate them and move them.”",
            "How has the pandemic affected Minnesota finances?",
            "Yeah, there’s a very real economic hit that we’re all seeing and obviously states can’t deficit spend. The good news was … we had a rainy-day fund that was proportionally as big as any state in the country. We still — even after Covid and even after our budget projections show about $4.7 billion deficit in the coming biennium. We still have AAA bond ratings. The fundamentals are still strong. One of the reasons is a fairly diversified economy, but it is going to make us think about how we make those investments, and I worry that these are the times when people turn to austerity and the very programs we need to close those gaps are going to take us investing.",
            "How will he resolve this tension?",
            "I think public-private partnerships that we’re really working on. I, as a public school teacher, believe [education] is foundational to our opportunities, but I also recognize that if we’re failing, we need to be thinking about that.",
            "How long will political leaders in states and nationally be dealing with the long-term fallout of the pandemic?",
            "That’s an interesting question. I can’t see it in — I would have to say during my lifetime you’ll still be thinking about what this meant and how it rearranged things. And again, I would argue, [he and leaders in both parties] had a pretty good working relationship — not Pollyannaish, again — in a very polarized environment. I was very proud to say we passed a bipartisan budget together. ...",
            "[Since the pandemic], now, the narrative is every business that’s not functioning, that’s my fault that I closed them down. Now, I don’t turn around and say, “Well, projections would have showed this many people are dead so if I’d have listened to you, we would have got that many people killed.” I don’t think that’s helpful but that is a narrative. So I think the politics where the One Minnesota is going to be a little harder work. We still have that. I’m very fearful. I saw this as a member of Congress. The danger of that pure polarization. … That’s it, and I worry here that same thing."

        "title": "Robert Kennedy’s Lesson on Political Violence That Joe Biden Needs to Learn",
        "body": [
            "In 1968, RFK showed there was a way to respect protesters and reassure voters he was serious about law and order.",
            "A specter is haunting Democrats—the specter of a Donald Trump victory in November fueled by suburban voters drawn to his promise of law and order. The polls tell one story—an ABC News survey shows voters give Joe Biden much higher marks than Trump on keeping the country and their family safe, on dealing with protests, on unifying the country. But, as POLITICO noted on Sunday, Democratic strategists are starting to pick up faint but disturbing signs that college-educated suburbanites are beginning to feel concern about their neighborhoods and the value of their homes—classic signs of a “retreat to safety” sentiment that would pose a clear and present danger to the Biden campaign.",
            "How much of this concern is well-founded? How much is unjustified panic on the part of what Biden’s team dismiss as “bed-wetters”? And, more to the point: Are there steps the Biden-Harris ticket can take, beyond the explicit condemnations of lawlessness, that could effectively assuage these concerns? The answer requires a look back into political history to a presidential campaign in which “law and order” was a dominant issue. But the most appealing message from a candidate was neither an authoritarian crackdown nor universal tolerance for protesters. ",
            "1968 was a year when disorder of every sort was a dominant presence. Nationally, violent crime had doubled since 1960. Racial upheaval had scarred the preceding three years: 34 dead in the Watts riots of 1965; 26 dead in Newark in 1967; 43 dead in Detroit that same year. In the spring of 1968, after the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., 125 cities erupted in violence, with 46 dead and thousands injured. The steps of the U.S. Capitol were ringed with sandbags and gun emplacements manned by troops from the 82nd Airborne Division. On college campuses, the year saw three students in Orangeburg, South Carolina, killed by highway patrol officers; two months later, police cleared protesters out of Columbia University buildings, injuring more than 100. Add this to the frustration over a Vietnam War that was taking more than 500 American lives a week, and the sense that events were spinning out of control was palpable. ",
            "There was no doubt that this sense of lost control, of chaos, was going to be a major issue in the presidential campaign. What’s striking is how differently the three most dominant candidates in the early going met that issue.",
            "For Alabama Governor George Wallace, running as an independent, the answer was as obvious as a mailed fist. Just as his solution to Vietnam was an overwhelming use of force, so was his answer to violence at home. Let the Alabama National Guardsmen deal with it, he said, they’d clean it up in a day or two. It was the elites, he said, living in doorman apartments and gated neighborhoods, who encouraged the protesters and protected the criminals. While Wallace’s electoral strength was clearly in the South, he had shown in 1964 that his appeal was broader, as he racked up significant votes in three Democratic primaries in Indiana, Maryland and Wisconsin.",
            "For Richard Nixon, the message was subtler. He would be the experienced hand who could address what one of his advertising team members described as “an uneasiness in the land, a feeling that things aren’t right, that we’re moving in the wrong direction.” From his first congressional campaign in 1946, Nixon had campaigned as the face of the “forgotten Americans, the people who paid the bills, did the work, just wanted a safe home and a good school for their kids.” As Robert Kennedy’s campaign (on which I was a junior speechwriter) drove through Indiana, we kept seeing billboards with Nixon posed alongside a briefcase, with the slogan “Feel Safer With Nixon.” His major ad, featuring footage of riots and fires, was careful to distinguish between legitimate protest and lawlessness, but emphasized that the right to an orderly society was “the first civil right.”",
            "And then there was Robert Kennedy.",
            "By 1968, he had become a tribune for Black and brown America. He had spoken in increasingly passionate terms about poverty and discrimination. He had identified with student protesters in a 1966 speech when he repeatedly said: “we dissent … ” He had called the inner-city riots, “a cry for love.” But Kennedy, part of a family whose support was rooted in working-class politics, was acutely aware of the power of law and order. As a New York senator, he’d seen a proposal for a civilian police review board go down to massive defeat. He’d seen the toxic mix of race and crime empower politicians in Boston, Newark and Philadelphia. He was determined not to cede the issue to the right. His campaign speeches declared that “we can’t have summer after summer of lawlessness.” He reminded audiences not that he’d been attorney general, but that he’d been “the chief law enforcement officer of the United States.” In the Indiana primary, he campaigned as vigorously in the white working-class neighborhoods of Gary and Hammond as in Black neighborhoods.",
            "He took some heat for this. The New York Times editorial board chastised him for moving to the right. Ronald Reagan and Nixon each noted that he was sounding more like them (although their speeches somehow left out the part where RFK talked about endemic poverty and a massive jobs program). But reporters began to notice an odd phenomenon: The same audiences who spoke about cracking down on demonstrators and who expressed admiration for Wallace also said they were considering voting for Kennedy.",
            "Why? Because, the answer came back, “He’s tough. He put crooks in jail.” Indeed, as researchers later learned, a considerable number of voters who went for RFK in the May Indiana primary wound up voting for Wallace in November. It turned out that what they were looking for was someone who could end the chaos; whether that was achieved by police state tactics or an ambitious effort to deal with racial injustice was a secondary matter.",
            "Whether Kennedy could have won over enough Wallace voters to win the White House had he been nominated, we will never know. We do know that after his death in June a majority of voters turned away from the Democratic nominee, Vice President Hubert Humphrey—who challenged Nixon for calling for a doubling of the rate of convictions and building more jails—to those with sterner messages. Nixon and Wallace shared 57 percent of the popular vote in 1968, and a combined total of 347 electoral votes.",
            "Of course, there are immense differences between 1968 and now. Until this spring’s spike in shootings and homicides, the nation’s violent crime rate was at a historic low. New York City, which reached a high of more than 2,200 homicides in 1990, had 350 last year. The unrest following the killing of George Floyd is nowhere near as widespread and fatal as the disorder of the late 1960s. The country is far more sympathetic to the cause of Black Lives Matter than it was even to the nonviolent campaigns of MLK, who was seen by a heavy plurality of Americans as doing more harm than good up until his death, according to a Harris poll taken early that year.",
            "And while Nixon was running as the challenger back then, Donald Trump is the president, whose capacity to deal with the unrest has so far been found wanting.",
            "But that does not mean there is no potential for a change in the political climate—especially if a key slice of voters comes to believe Trump’s assertion that Biden and Kamala Harris would be unable to control the most violent of the street protesters. Yes, they have been explicit in saying that looting and burning are crimes that could be prosecuted. But at least among some of their most ardent supporters, there is a measure of denial about what is happening. On Twitter, there has been a stream of pictures showing peaceful neighborhoods in Portland, Minneapolis and Kenosha, as if those pictures somehow erase the evidence of significant destruction elsewhere in those cities. There are citations of a study that showed 93 percent of protests were peaceful—which is hardly reassuring to the dozens, or hundreds of families who have had their work and their futures ruined by the remaining 7 percent of protests. Among some of Biden’s media allies there’s been an attempt to downplay what has happened—most memorably in that screen capture of a CNN reporter standing in front of a burning building as the chyron reads: “Fiery but mostly peaceful protests.”",
            "What would help is for Biden and Harris to identify the victims of destruction—many of whom are Black or brown or immigrant small-business owners—as other victims, and to assert that they deserve protection even as the work goes on in dealing with the police tactics that wound and kill people of color. (Harris took a significant step in this direction during her visit to Wisconsin on Labor Day.) They can make the point that the journey from marches to civil disobedience does not extend into setting buildings on fire or looting stores … and that the issue is not a matter of political impact, but of simple right and wrong. (Harris might even mention that as prosecutor, her job included dispensing equal justice, protecting the rights of the accused and putting dangerous criminals away.) They might even note the absolute indefensibility of a book like the recently released “In Defense of Looting.” And they can certainly call out Trump for inflaming the worst instincts of his most zealous supporters, leading to violent clashes at protest sites.",
            "None of these steps would undermine Biden’s determination to act as a healer, to reject Trump’s increasingly outright racist appeals to his base. Indeed, Biden’s record on civil rights gives him the same space as RFK had in 1968—or that anti-communist crusader Nixon had in 1972 to go to China—to rebut Trump’s attempt to paint him as a puppet of antifa.",
            "The key for Biden is to take to heart the lesson of history: You can be a “law and order” candidate without embracing the language of divisiveness or the tactics of a police state. What voters want to know is that you take their concerns seriously, that you neither exacerbate legitimate fears nor minimize them. And if elements of the Twitterverse assail you for acknowledging such concerns, well, that’s a price well worth paying."

            "Some Trump supporters have taken it upon themselves to police cities experiencing unrest. And Trump isn't condemning the behavior as he pushes a law-and-order election message.",
            "A take-to-the-streets MAGA movement that started online has become a reality, egged on by the oblique encouragement of President Donald Trump and little pushback from conservative leaders.",
            "It’s a call to arms that has been bubbling online for weeks amid nationwide racial justice protests, circulating among white nationalist-affiliated groups and in local Facebook groups. Armed vigilantes have begun showing up, saying they were there to defend property and arguing Democrats had let lawlessness reign in the streets.",
            "But the recent violent clashes in Portland and Kenosha, Wis., represent a turning point in the effort. In Portland, Trump supporters showed up as counterprotesters, and one of them ended up shot and killed. In Kenosha — where 17-year-old Kyle Rittenhouse was charged with killing two people — the clashes came to a smaller city, one that bridges the divide between major urban centers and suburban America.",
            "It’s a development Trump and his team have latched onto as they try to win back much-needed suburban voters with a law-and-order message. Trump has branded the racial justice protesters “domestic terror,” praised the Trump-supporting counterprotesters, defended Rittenhouse’s actions and traveled to Kenosha on Tuesday to misleadingly take credit for stopping violence in the city and other urban areas. “It’s all Democrat, everything is Democrat, all of these problems are Democratic cities,” he told reporters during his tour.",
            "The rhetoric is part of Trump’s two-track messaging as he heads into the final few months of the campaign. To his supporters, it’s an implication: I won’t condemn you if you show up. And to suburban voters, it’s a proclamation: The states have abdicated their duties, and only I can fix the violence that’s creeping closer.",
            "“It is certainly true that there are plenty of conservatives who are growing ever more impatient with both Democrat-elected officials, who typically are at the state and local levels, and also with President Trump,” said Scott Walter, the president of the conservative-leaning Capital Research Center. “Because some of them see him as not acting as forcefully as he should.”",
            "Since the resurgence of Black Lives Matter protests this year, Trump and his allies have ramped up not just their rhetoric about alleged lawlessness, looting and riots pervading American cities like Chicago, Seattle and Portland, but their actions as well, criticizing cities for rebuffing Trump’s overtures to deploy federal officials.",
            "Trump’s offers have varied, from tweeting that he wanted to send federal forces into Seattle to dismantle the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone, several square city blocks that were being occupied by anti-police demonstrators, to blasting Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot for supposedly resisting his help in policing gun violence in her city.",
            "But some of Trump’s supporters have also taken it upon themselves to police these cities.",
            "Though the narrative of American cities being overrun with violence has percolated through conservative media, it’s picked up in the past few years as anti-Trump, pro-BLM, and anti-police protests have snowballed. Scenes of looting, vandalism and property destruction only bolstered this worldview, and last year, right-wing extremists started clashing with antifa groups in Portland.",
            "But after the killing of George Floyd in May, racial justice protests exploded across the country, with occasional instances of looting and vandalism. These destructive moments turbocharged the far-right calls to proactively defend private property that was being targeted.",
            "While extremely few high-profile voices openly called for people to take to the streets and push back against protesters, there was an undercurrent of approval for those who did. Several videos emerged on the internet of police officers across the country chatting amiably with far-right militia members, often armed, during racial justice protests. Members of the Proud Boys, the main far-right group that brawled with antifa protesters in Portland last year, were spotted mingling with police union audience members during an appearance by Vice President Mike Pence earlier this summer.",
            "And the St. Louis couple who went viral after a photo emerged of them waving guns at BLM protesters outside their house soon became MAGA superstars, getting a speaking slot at the Republican National Convention last week.",
            "“How shocked are we that 17-year-olds with rifles decided they had to maintain order when no one else would?” Fox News host Tucker Carlson told his millions of viewers last week. His colleague Laura Ingraham on Tuesday asked why people were rushing to vilify Rittenhouse for exercising his “God-given right” to defend himself.",
            "“If that’s the case, we are going to be in for a really, really long and protracted period of complete chaos and destruction which I don’t think the American people want,” she added.",
            "From the beginning of the summer of protests, Trump, who won the endorsements of numerous law enforcement unions and interest groups in 2016, quickly embraced the protests as a culture wars issue, saying the words Black Lives Matter were a “symbol of hate” and calling racial justice protesters “looters” and “anarchists.” He has also accused Democratic rival Joe Biden of leading a party hellbent on destroying “LAW & ORDER” throughout the country.",
            "And Trump’s refusal to condemn Rittenhouse, or to stop armed right-wing militia members from traveling to cities seeking out fights with BLM protesters, has only encouraged his fans.",
            "The situation came to a head recently in Portland and Kenosha.",
            "In Portland, the home of months of clashes between law enforcement and local protesters, an avowed antifa supporter allegedly shot and killed a member of Patriot Prayer, an independent group that had descended in a miles-long caravan on the city over the weekend in an attempt to show support for law enforcement and the president. On Thursday night, police shot and killed the primary suspect in that shooting as they attempted to arrest him.",
            "And in Kenosha, there has been a rise of ad hoc, questionably legal militia groups such as the Kenosha Guard, a Facebook group heavily criticized for posting a “call to arms” against protesters on its page just days before the Rittenhouse shooting. In an interview with Kenosha News last Thursday, the group’s leader, Kevin Mathewson, stood by his belief that the “failure from local leaders” to secure their neighborhoods prompted him to make the post.",
            "“This is what the Second Amendment was written for,” said Jack Posobiec, a pro-Trump correspondent with One America News Network and far-right internet personality. “We are at war in Kenosha. We are under siege. We are under attack. When law enforcement is outnumbered, that’s when citizens have the right to take up arms to defend their lives, their homes and their businesses.”",
            "People have also been traveling into the city. The Justice Department on Thursday charged two Missouri men, Michael Karmo and Cody Smith, with firearms offenses after they were arrested with a massive cache of weapons. The pair allegedly went to the city to see Trump during a trip there Tuesday and “to see proof of the rioting,” according to a DOJ filing. Karmo also allegedly told a witness that he was going to possibly use the firearms on people in Kenosha.",
            "Conservatives say unrest in Kenosha — a small Midwestern city with less than 100,000 residents — is likely to resonate more profoundly with suburbanites.",
            "Posobiec pointed out that suburbanites had more affinity with their nearby mid-sized cities and, thus, would feel a stronger impact when seeing protests and property destruction in their own backyard.",
            "“People move to the suburbs because they like living in a quieter area, but they also like to be close to an urban area, because they can then use that for work or going out shopping for entertainment, etc. And so they do feel a sense of connection to that urban area,” he said. “I can't speak for the people of Kenosha or that surrounding area, but I understand the mentality of somebody living in the suburbs of Kenosha wanting to defend Kenosha from riots.”",
            "At this point, Walter said, the racial aspect of the BLM movement might not even play into the criticism of protesters anymore, pointing out that Trump seemed to have lost little support among Black voters.",
            "“Probably that’s because some portion of Black folks who live in these places that are already harmed, or in danger of getting harmed, are getting disturbed,” he claimed.",
            "A Quinnipiac poll released Wednesday showed Trump had 11 percent support among Black voters — slightly higher than the 7 percent he’d polled at in July.",
            "Trump’s push to peg the violence to Democratic policy failures will likely continue into the final leg of the election — and absent a sustained campaign to condemn militia action, there is no impetus for his militia supporters to stop infiltrating American cities, either.",
            "“It’s just crazy to think this is going on in the heartland,” said Posobiec. “If we're talking about Main Street, this is Main Street, USA being set on fire, and a political stalemate, and law enforcement at all levels wasn't responding.”"

            "The other side may have lost its mind. But are you sure you aren't losing yours?",
            "Someday years from now, Kamala Harris declared in her Democratic convention address, children and grandchildren will look back on Donald Trump’s presidency with a bracing question for the people who lived through it: “Where were you when the stakes were so high?”",
            "There surely will be some good stories to tell:",
            "“By day, I was an ordinary shopkeeper. By night, my comrades and I donned camouflage and planted bombs under railroad trestles to disrupt the supply of makeup and hairspray heading to the White House and Fox News studios.”",
            "Or maybe:",
            "“I had an affair with a senior Trump White House official. I pretended to love her even as I inwardly recoiled at her icy touch. Each night I delivered the secrets I learned by carrier pigeon to leaders of The Resistance.”",
            "Among most Democrats and a notable number of Republicans, it is now a prevailing notion that the general election ahead represents an existential moment for American democracy. Not just Harris, but Joe Biden and, especially, former President Barack Obama painted the choice in precisely these terms.",
            "But if the character of Trump resistance is different than historic resistance movements that is because the Trump threat is likewise of a different character. It arrives at a time when nearly every dimension of daily life reflects how we live in an Age of Small. We fight a virus that is invisible to the naked eye. We communicate with one another most often in bursts of sentence fragments by text and Twitter.",
            "Even those who answer Obama’s urgent summons—“Don’t let them take away your democracy”—will join a movement that for the most part exists in an agitated digital space that hardly has a tactile dimension. It will be hard to evoke any retrospective romance of the sort associated with the French Resistance in World War II or the anti-fascists of the Spanish Civil War, as memorialized in the literature or Hemingway and Orwell. ",
            "Until this summer, when several cities erupted in anger over George Floyd, the Trump Resistance has lacked the brutal physicality of the civil rights movement, when protesters regularly faced the batons of police officers and sometimes the guns and nooses of Klansman.",
            "Even now, for the vast majority of people who oppose Trump, the honest answer those children and grandchildren who ask “where were you” when constitutional democracy was on the line will be something like: ",
            "“I was on my couch compulsively watching cable and checking social media, by turns indignant and depressed.”",
            "“I was on the driveway storming out of a holiday gathering after I just couldn’t listen to my uncle spout his Trump B.S. any longer.",
            "“At the dinner table we would play those videos by that funny woman, what’s her name, Sarah something? ... Yes, that’s it, Cooper.”",
            "The point is not to trivialize Obama’s dire warnings, or to argue that the threat he describes to historic norms of governance is illusory. But the gap between drastic language about the peril represented by Trump and the banal housebound way that all but the most energized activists are experiencing the moment illuminates a point about both the Trump and anti-Trump movements.",
            "Both movements are in part ideological but more profoundly psychological. They are driven by people who find the era fundamentally disorienting, who not only hold the other side’s political leaders in contempt but are aghast that fellow citizens somehow are in the grip of an alternate reality.",
            "The reason Obama can credibly warn the anti-Trump movement that democracy is on the line does not have to do with midnight knocks on the door, imprisonment or murder of journalists or opposition party leaders, unchecked surveillance as an instrument of political control. These things are happening—at an accelerating pace—all over the world, but not here. On concrete questions of law, George W. Bush’s terror policies arguably represented a more fundamental challenge than Trump tenure has to once-settled questions of civil liberties and the relationship of the individual to state power.",
            "The reason Trump is to many people the more profound threat is that he has eviscerated everyone’s sense of normal, of the shared conviction that “that’s just not how things are done in America.” High-level intervention in criminal investigations in which Trump has a political interest, pardons for cronies, firings of inspectors general, profiting off government business at Trump properties—these are the most prominent examples.",
            "But, so, too, is just about any day picked at random. Just this week, Trump in an interview claimed he has knowledge of an airplane headed to Washington “almost completely loaded with thugs, wearing these dark uniforms, black uniforms, with gear and this and that” hoping to disrupt his virtual convention week; Asserted that Biden is taking a drug—“some kind of enhancement”—to help with allegedly failing mental acuity; and one of his campaign spokesmen in a television appearance said Kyle Rittenhouse, charged with first-degree murder of protesters in Kenosha, Wis., was practicing understandable vigilante justice: “If you don’t allow police to do their job, then the American people have to defend themselves some way.”",
            "Yes, all these comments—and dozens of others—raced across social media and cable as uproars. But under the previous 44 presidencies, any one of these moments naturally would have been so breathtaking that it would have dominated news coverage for months, and effectively brought the presidency to a standstill.",
            "If democracy requires some shared sense of normal—of what is in bounds and what is not—there is no question that Trump is so far winning the psychological war on democracy. ",
            "The most striking result of a USA Today/Suffolk University poll this week was the finding that 28 percent of Biden supporters say they aren't prepared to accept a Trump victory as fairly won. Nineteen percent of Trump backers say “they aren't prepared to accept a Biden victory as legitimate,” the USA Today story said.",
            "This result isn’t because of government jackboots. It is because of a degraded political culture in which people do not believe—have no reason to disbelieve—that basic institutions and rituals of democracy are on the level.",
            "I’m typically a bit skeptical of journalists or political activists who portray themselves—in a U.S. domestic political context—as fighting heroically on the barricades of freedom. It seems frivolous for people who move freely between home and television studio, often while promoting books or other lucrative projects, to compare themselves with people who genuinely are at risk of jail or torture or summary execution in other countries.",
            "Increasingly, though, it seems clear that physical peril isn’t the only kind of threat to democracy. The psychological kind matters, too.",
            "Is hurling obscenities at the television screen or trading mocking videos of Trump an expression of a robust democratic culture at work? That seems likely to me. Or is it what people do when they worry that culture is potentially eroding beyond repair?",
            "The latter is the scenario Obama warned about. Let’s hope, years from now, his words sound a bit overexcited. We will be in trouble if they sound prescient."

            "President Donald Trump on Monday likened police officers who commit acts of brutality to golfers who “choke” and miss a 3-foot putt, resisting the real-time efforts of a conservative cable news ally to steer him away from the comparison.",
            "The remarks from the president came in an interview with Fox News’ Laura Ingraham, during which Trump lamented how law enforcement officers are “under siege” in the United States amid new scrutiny of racial injustice in policing.",
            "“They can do 10,000 great acts, which is what they do, and one bad apple or a choker — you know, a choker. They choke,” Trump said, apparently making reference to the shooting of Jacob Blake by police in Kenosha, Wis.",
            "Blake, a 29-year-old Black man, was shot in the back seven times by a white police officer on Aug. 23 as he leaned into his car. Three of Blake’s children were reportedly in the back seat of his SUV when their father was shot. ",
            "Blake survived the shooting, but family members have said he is paralyzed from the waist down.",
            "“Shooting the guy in the back many times. I mean, couldn’t you have done something different? Couldn’t you have wrestled him?” Trump said Monday. “You know, I mean, in the meantime, he might’ve been going for a weapon. And, you know, there’s a whole big thing there.”",
            "It was not clear whether Trump was specifically discussing Blake’s shooting or advancing unfounded speculation about the role of a weapon in that case. ",
            "The Wisconsin Department of Justice reported last week that its investigators “recovered a knife from the driver’s side floorboard” in Blake’s vehicle. But law enforcement have not said the knife or any other weapon was used in Blake’s encounter with police. ",
            "Nevertheless, Trump proceeded Monday to say of police officers: “They choke just like in a golf tournament. They miss a 3-foot putt.”",
            "It was then that Ingraham interjected, telling the president: “You’re not comparing it to golf, because of course that’s what the media would say.”",
            "“I’m saying people choke. People choke,” Trump responded. “And people are bad people. You have both. You have some bad people and you have — they choke.”",
            "Trump’s comments are in keeping with other broad defenses of law enforcement he has issued this summer as the country has struggled with a racial reckoning sparked by the killing of George Floyd by Minneapolis police in May. ",
            "“We must remember that the overwhelming majority of police officers in this country — and that’s the overwhelming majority — are noble, courageous, and honorable,” Trump said in his Republican National Convention acceptance speech last week. “We have to give law enforcement, our police, back their power.”",
            "The president echoed that rhetoric Monday, expressing sympathy for long-tenured police who respond disproportionately to perceived threats when they have a “quarter-of-a-second to make a decision.”",
            "“If you don’t make the decision, and you’re wrong, you’re dead. People choke under those circumstances, and they make a bad decision. I’ve seen bad decisions of people that it looked bad, but probably it was a choke,” Trump said. ",
            "“But you also have bad police,” he added. “But you also — the vast, not only the vast majority — thousands and thousands of great acts and one bad one, and you make the evening news for weeks.”"

            "Republicans framed the disorder surrounding demonstrations against police brutality and racial injustice as a harbinger of what would come should Biden win the White House in November. Democrats drove home the point that what’s happening on the ground is a direct result of who’s already in the White House.",
            "“The chaos and the disorder and the lawlessness that we are currently seeing, that’s Donald Trump’s America,” Rep. Val Demings (D-Fla.) said on CBS’ “Face the Nation.”",
            "At least a half-dozen Democrats appeared across the spectrum of Sunday political talk shows, where they condemned violence, pilloried the president and made clear that he was responsible for what is happening in this country.",
            "“We are not safe in Donald Trump’s America,” Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota added on ABC’s “This Week.”",
            "White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, however, maintained that it was “just not accurate” to “reframe it that way.”",
            "“You know, you want to talk about Donald Trump’s America,” he said in an interview on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” “Most of Donald Trump’s America is peaceful.”",
            "A man whose hat bore the insignia of a far-right group called Patriot Prayer was fatally shot late Saturday during a clash between Trump supporters and counter-protesters, capping a violent week in America that began with a white police officer shooting Jacob Blake, a Black man, in the back seven times in Kenosha, Wis., last Sunday. Two days later, a white teenager from Illinois allegedly shot three people in Kenosha, killing two of them.",
            "Protests have occurred for more than 90 consecutive days in Portland since George Floyd, another Black man, was killed by the police in Minneapolis in May. Portland police have yet to release details of the man who was killed over the weekend or any information about the suspected gunman.",
            "On Sunday afternoon, Portland’s mayor, Ted Wheeler, held a news conference to denounce the violence, pledging that the shooter would be arrested and prosecuted. He asked the community to “pull together in the name of peace and humanity,” and castigated Trump for language and actions that he blamed for sparking conflict.",
            "“Do you seriously wonder, Mr. President, why this is the first time in decades that America has seen this level of violence?“ Wheeler said. “It's you who have created the hate and the division. It's you who have not found a way to say the names of Black people killed by police officers, even as people in law enforcement have, and it‘s you who claimed that white supremacists are good people. Your campaign of fear is as anti-democratic as anything you have done to create hate and vitriol in our beautiful country.“",
            "Trump for weeks has painted Portland as a city whose leaders can’t control its citizens or prevent protesters from destroying it. The president has sent federal agents there to protect government property and control “anarchists and agitators,” elevating confrontations between protesters and law enforcement as he calls for law and order.",
            "That message was widespread at last week’s Republican National Convention, where supporters warned of cities being overrun by violent mobs on the radical left. With the coronavirus pandemic killing more than 180,000 Americans and battering the economy, Republicans are trying to make safety a key campaign issue amid a national reckoning on race relations, driving their message of law and order as Democrats emphasize the need for police reform to halt the killings of unarmed Black people.",
            "Trump tweeted on Saturday that “Kenosha has been very quiet” since the National Guard entered the city, indicating the same would be true of Portland if its leaders accepted the administration’s assistance.",
            "“Our great National Guard could solve these problems in less than 1 hour,” Trump tweeted on Sunday. “Local authorities must ask before it is too late.”",
            "Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf said the administration was waiting for the investigation of the Portland shooting to play out, but he also suggested that the killing pointed to the larger issue of state and local officials “not allowing law enforcement to do their job and really to bring this violent activity night after night after night to a close.”",
            "“As you see that continue to unfold over the course of three months, you are going to continue to see violent activity,” Wolf predicted on ABC. The administration is “happy to provide resources to bring this violence to an end, violence that, again, across the ideological spectrum, left or right, the violence needs to end.”",
            "Trump will travel to Kenosha on Tuesday to meet with local law enforcement. Lara Trump, the president’s daughter-in-law and a senior campaign adviser, said the president had reached out to Blake’s family, but it is unclear whether they will meet this week.",
            "“I’m sure, given the opportunity, he would be more than happy to do that,” she said on “Fox News Sunday.” “But I haven’t gotten that information just yet.”",

Rand Paul (R-Ky.) and his wife outside of the White House after the president’s nomination acceptance speech Thursday, Lara Trump said, “You didn’t see that happening on the other side,” because “that would never happen.”",

            "Rep. Karen Bass (D-Calif.), who chairs the Congressional Black Caucus, said Kenosha shouldn’t be used as a way to campaign.",
            "“I think his visit has one purpose and one purpose only, and that is to agitate things and to make things worse,” she said on CNN’s “State of the Union.” “What also happened in Portland, too, you saw a parade of Trump supporters actually actively shooting paintballs at peaceful protesters. And the president, in my opinion, encourages that. He actually retweeted the people firing paint guns. So, I think he only means to agitate things. He is campaigning.”",
            "Biden, the Democratic presidential nominee, is planning to address the nation this week in a unifying speech that will showcase his leadership, according to his campaign, but it is unclear whether he will travel to Wisconsin.",
            "On Sunday afternoon he denounced the Portland shooting and, more broadly, the violence stemming from recent protests. He also called on Trump to take a similar stance.",
            "“The deadly violence we saw overnight in Portland is unacceptable,” Biden said in a written statement. “Shooting in the streets of a great American city is unacceptable. I condemn this violence unequivocally. I condemn violence of every kind by any one, whether on the left or the right. And I challenge Donald Trump to do the same.“",
            "Biden called for unity and, like his allies, blamed Trump for encouraging division.",

A country that vows vengeance toward one another. But that is the America that President Trump wants us to be, the America he believes we are.“",
            "To Conway’s point, recent polling indicates that white suburban voters would feel less safe in a Biden administration, something the Biden campaign rejects.",
            "“I think suburban voters are looking around at what’s going on in this country and they’re looking at who’s in the White House and they’re seeing Donald Trump. They don’t see Joe Biden,” Kate Bedingfield, Biden’s deputy campaign manager, said on “Fox News Sunday.” “They see Donald Trump in the White House. This is Trump’s America. The chaos that suburban voters are feeling and that voters all across this country are feeling is a result of Donald Trump’s failed leadership.”",
            "Bedingfield also accused Trump of trying to incite violence, and the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), told CNN that Trump was “willfully fanning the flames of this violence.”",
            "Trump began his Sunday with a flurry of activity on social media, tweeting, retweeting and quote-tweeting dozens of messages that ran the gamut from bashing Wheeler — siding with a post that referred to him as a “useless f---ing idiot” — to praising the caravan of supporters who drove into Portland over the weekend as “GREAT PATRIOTS” and sharing a satirical news article that quoted Biden talking to a department store mannequin.",
            "In the afternoon, the president referred to Wheeler on Twitter as “the dummy running Portland,” and concluded: “The only way you will stop the violence in the high crime Democrat run cities is through strength!“ Earlier in the day, he had retweeted a post that gave Wheeler’s phone number and asked people to call it to tell him to resign.",
            "Additional posts that appeared on the president’s timeline suggested that Wheeler should resign “for committing war crimes,” that Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York should be jailed and that Mayor Muriel Bowser of Washington, D.C., should arrest “agitators and thugs!” The president also reissued a call for “LAW & ORDER!!!”",
            "“It is quite interesting to listen to President Donald John Trump talk about being the law-and-order president when no one has violated the law in 2020 more than he has,” said Demings, who served as an impeachment manager earlier this year and sits on the House Intelligence and Judiciary panels. “We’re talking about a president who just had his kickoff for his reelection on the grounds of the White House. And we all know that that was a violation of law.”",
            "Trump campaigned on a pledge to restore safety, though Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) cautioned, “President Trump has a tendency to overpromise.”",
            "Still, Republicans insisted that chaos in Democratic-led cities was the fault of those very Democrats, not the president. Meadows said the Trump administration had repeatedly offered federal assistance to cities, help that was rejected in Portland.",
            "“The president is on the side of law enforcement and the rule of law,” Meadows said.",
            "Trump on Sunday morning also shared a post predicting that he could win as much as 16 percent of the Black vote, doubling the support he got in 2016.",
            "Cedric Richmond (D-La.), a Biden campaign co-chairman, said the president “effectively” raised the question of what Black Americans have to lose by supporting him in 2016. ",
            "“Black men see clearly what they have to lose,” Richmond said on NBC. “They can get killed and the president won’t say a word, won’t utter Jacob Blake’s name, will not talk about police reform.”",
            "“This is his America. So how do you break this country and then run for reelection saying, ‘I want to fix everything that I just destroyed?’” Richmond continued. “And so that will be the message of the campaign, and we’re going to have to make that case. But at the same time, I think America is in a real fragile point and I think that you will hear Joe Biden speak, you will hear him try to heal this country, because the president just doesn’t have it in him.”"

        "body": [
            "Speakers throughout the day emphasized a moderate message at odds with the demands for a more sweeping criminal justice overhaul voiced by many in the crowd.",
            "The thousands gathered for the 57th March on Washington on the National Mall on Friday heard civil rights leaders call for policy reform and civic engagement. Though for some, the message from the day’s speakers did not match the urgency of the moment. The disconnect reveals a growing tension between veteran organizers and younger grassroots protesters, one that the civil rights movement has navigated for decades.",
            "The event focused on ways to end police violence against African-Americans — a steep challenge that, Rev. Al Sharpton argued, could become a reality in 2020 as a result of this summer’s multi-racial protests against police violence and institutional racism. Those attending the march, which was organized by Sharpton’s National Action Network and Martin Luther King III, expressed a palpable concern about police violence that has not been as visible at previous marches. Many said that incremental reforms would not fix things. Rather, completely rethinking the approach to policing and public safety was necessary — immediately.",
            "These more radical ideas were not echoed from the podium. A majority of the day’s speakers focused on working through the existing political systems — via congressional legislation and turning out to vote — to avoid another George Floyd (killed by police) or Jacob Blake (seriously wounded). Their proposals, some argued, aren’t enough to solve large, complex issues like criminal justice reform and systemic racism. Polling shows that even across races, there is a divide between age groups about how to respond to this iteration of the movement. ",
            "“We’re tired of hearing about reform. We’re tired of hearing that something will change and it doesn’t,” said Zayhna Woodson, a college-aged attendee who traveled with nearly a dozen members of her family to the march from Lansing, Mich. To her, voting mattered more on the state and local levels because they were changes she felt she had real control over.",
            "“I feel like the system, no matter what we do, how we vote, at the top — it doesn’t matter. It needs to be abolished and made into something new. Because what we have right now is not working. They say, ‘left-wing’, ‘right-wing’, it’s all the same bird.”",
            "“To a certain extent, you’ve always got that energy,” explained Cliff Albright, co-founder of Black Voters Matter. Albright argued that the march’s timing didn’t match the needs of the moment, saying that hosting a national gathering like Sharpton’s could alienate younger grassroots activists who’ve spent months organizing protests and other direct action. ",
            "“A lot of times what winds up happening is that there's just kind of simmering tensions and these feelings of a lack of respect and feelings that your methods aren't really being supported,” Albright said. ",
            "Friday’s speakers called for the passage of the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act and John Lewis Voting Rights Act before the 2020 election. Both bills have passed the House but remain in limbo in the Senate.",
            "Sharpton and others affiliated with the march maintained that galvanizing the thousands of attendees to push for immediate action on the legislation is a major feat. It is also why the gathering’s full title is the “Get Your Knee Off Our Necks Commitment March,” to underline the grassroots’ role in pushing through sweeping legislative changes.",
            "Speakers harkened back to the Civil Rights Act of 1965, which was made possible, in part, by the original March on Washington in 1963. Rep. John Lewis, who died in July, was the last living speaker at that march, which was organized by A. Philip Randolph and Bayard Rustin and featured Martin Luther King Jr.’s “I Have a Dream” speech. Sharpton, who was molded in the same activist tradition, emphasized that organizers hoped to achieve the same kind of policy outcome as the event’s original planners.",
            "“This is the time for legislative change,” Sharpton affirmed in his address to the crowd, flanked by Reps. Al Green and Sheila Jackson Lee, two sponsors of the George Floyd Act. “This is the time for us to vote like we’ve never voted before. We want to get rid of anybody that’s in our way. Our parents died for us to vote.” ",
            "Even as different generations of organizers debate tactics, there remains a sense of community and understanding about the common goals of the movement — and the life-and-death consequences of what it is pushing for. ",
            "“I think that people are ready to see change now,” said Rep. Green (D-Texas). “They've been waiting for a long time for this moment. And I think they're seizing upon the moment that there's an urgency of now that cannot be escaped.” ",
            "Perhaps what united the attendees most were the figures who were central to the march: victims of police violence and their families. ",
            "Kenethia Alston, the mother of Marqueese Alston, who was killed by D.C. police in 2018, said she felt the frequent, high-profile nature of police brutality seen in Floyd’s and Blake’s respective cases will be the ultimate driver of policy success.",
            "“The message is not just for continuous symbols of marches but for true change for police brutality cases,” Alston said in an interview. “I believe that there’s been a new, energized revolution towards police brutality and I’m trusting and affirming that that will be true change as it relates to not only George Floyd’s case but Marqueese and others as well.” ",
            "Marchers flooded the mall with “8:46” t-shirts and masks in recognition of the time Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin spent kneeling on George Floyd’s kneck, killing him. Many carried “say her name” signs in recognition of Breonna Taylor, who was shot and killed by police officers in her own apartment, along with enlarged photos of Elijah McClain, Tamir Rice, Trayvon Martin and others killed at the hands of police or white vigilantes.",

            "“I’m scared for him,” she said, referencing her grandson. “I’m scared when he goes to school, I’m scared when he’s outside playing. I’m afraid that the police don’t understand Black childrens’ behavior and their mannerisms so they take everything for a threat and they kill our children. I want to see change for that.”"

        "body": [
            "The BREATHE Act is the centerpiece of the policy agenda activists are pushing after months of demonstrations over racial injustice.",
            "After three months of sustained public protest, Black Lives Matter organizers are stepping from streets and plazas into the policy arena. And they’re going big.",
            "The BREATHE Act, a four-part proposal named after the phrase uttered by Black men Eric Garner and George Floyd while in police choke holds, aims to codify the movement’s core objective: redirecting federal funds away from police, prisons and other parts of the criminal justice system and into underserved communities of color. ",
            "“I think that we've demonstrated over time that we have the rigor and the relationships and the expertise to truly generate meaningful ideas into public policy solutions,\" said Jessica Byrd, a Democratic strategist and lead organizer of the Black National Convention, the virtual gathering of activists taking place Friday night. “And the BREATHE Act is the best and highest example of that.”",
            "The policy document is set to take center stage at the Black National Convention, which aims to create “a vision for Black Lives before the biggest election of our time, and long after.” While its architects recognize it does not have the necessary backing on Capitol Hill — even in a Democratic-majority House — they argue it’s an important marker for activists as they seek to turn the momentum gained through a summer of protest into political wins. How far they go in building support will be a critical test of the movement’s enduring influence, post-George Floyd. ",
            "“Certainly, this is a moment politically where I think so many of us are trying to see where the rebellions in the streets will have impact on policy, platform and practice of the major political parties,” said Alicia Garza, a co-founder of Black Lives Matter. “And, you know, for us, I think the BREATHE Act really represents an opportunity to galvanize voters, particularly Black voters, in this election cycle.”",
            "The BREATHE Act finds its roots in the 2016 policy platform called the Vision for Black Lives. It was drafted in response to the police killings of African Americans like Michael Brown, Sandra Bland and Philando Castile and called for a similar divest-invest approach to policing and public safety that Byrd said was often rebuffed “as this lofty, unviable set of ideas.” ",
            "But George Floyd’s death at the hands of a Minneapolis police officer catapulted the discussion over defunding the police into the mainstream and turned Black Lives Matter from a controversial topic into a household phrase. In the latest sign of its cultural significance, athletes across several professional leagues including the NBA, WNBA and MLB this week opted to break their contracts and sit out games and matches in a show of solidarity with anti-racism protesters. ",
            "The response has convinced Byrd and other organizers that the BREATHE Act also has the potential to go mainstream. She and others involved with the Black National Convention plan to highlight the proposal Friday as an example of the work organizers are doing not just to protest current injustices, but end them.",
            "“What we want to tell folks is that in this moment, we are ripe for transformation. And we can build that and achieve that if we come together under a shared political vision that touches on policies around reproductive justice and housing and the criminal legal system which includes policing and the environment,” said Kayla Reed, executive director of the organizing group Action St. Louis and co-founder of the Movement for Black Lives’ Electoral Justice Project. ",
            "“We don't have to just get one thing done,” Reed continued. “We can get it all done, because it's what our communities deserve.”",
            "The BREATHE Act’s terms go beyond criminal justice reform. The plan calls for funding for infrastructure that can withstand climate change-related disasters and federal grants to guarantee clean air and water for all communities. It also supports the passage of H.R. 40, which would establish a committee for the study of reparations; and calls for the expansion of existing health programs like Medicaid under the terms of the Affordable Care Act.",
            "There have been some small signs of progress in building support for the proposal, which has yet to be formally introduced in Congress. When the Movement for Black Lives requested a meeting with the Congressional Black Caucus to present the BREATHE Act, Sen. Kamala Harris, stepped up to arrange it. ",
            "Sen. Cory Booker introduced a sweeping criminal justice reform bill in 2019 that would reduce mandatory minimums for drug offenses, reinstate the right to vote for the formerly incarcerated and expunge records for those with marijuana offenses. And in July, Patrisse Cullors, co-founder of Black Lives Matter, addressed the Democratic National Committee’s platform committee to encourage the party’s top brass to adopt the BREATHE Act as part of its platform. ",
            "Harris, now the party's vice presidential nominee, has made no further commitment to backing the BREATHE Act, however. And the DNC did not adopt the proposal as part of the party platform, though it did include the phrase “Black lives matter” with the promise to study the impacts of slavery and Jim Crow-era segregation on current racial inequities. Booker’s bill is unlikely to make any progress in the current, Republican-held Senate.",
            "Even in the Democrat-controlled House, the legislation is likely to face a frosty reception. Most Democrats in Congress have already rejected the idea of defunding the police. Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden has proposed a $300 million investment in the COPS program, which would hire more police officers and require that their demographics mirror the communities they serve.",
            "During a virtual panel hosted by UCLA’s Latino Policy and Politics Initiative in July, CBC Chair Karen Bass told POLITICO that elements of the BREATHE Act are already in existing legislation. However, parts of the sweeping proposal, she said, are “more challenging.”",
            "“One of the main points of that bill is that it shows how you can cut federal spending and re-invest in communities and that concept, that principle is something I feel very strongly about,” Bass said. “The wholesale elimination of programs, I think, would be challenging.”",
            "The legislation does, however, have the support of prominent progressives Democratic Reps. Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, who plan to co-sponsor it. And organizers see a handful of new allies in young, Black progressives politicians such as New York’s Jamaal Bowman and Missouri’s Cori Bush, whose primary victories this summer all but assure them of seats in Congress in 2021. ",
            "To some organizers, Bowman and Bush’s election wins, which involved ousting older, moderate Democrats, are an important step forward for the young generation of activists seeking to shape policy at the local, state and federal levels.",
            "“I hope that we continue as protesters to go and seek the power [in] Congress and state legislatures and city halls and that we remember the values and principles we wanted the leaders before us to have,” said Clifton Kinnie, a St. Louis-based organizer and founder of Our Destiny STL, a network of young activists in Missouri. “I believe that Cori Bush will not only do that but will do so much more to voice the concerns of the people here. I think this is just the beginning.”",
            "Supporters of the proposal also note that despite the public’s reluctance to embrace calls to defund the police, sweeping police reform measures remain popular. A 2019 study conducted by the Black Futures Lab, a think tank led by Garza, found that 85 percent of the more than 30,000 Black respondents desired more police accountability. A plurality of respondents reported having negative interactions with police and a majority were in favor of more investment in Black communities. ",
            "And polling shows support for reform is also growing outside the Black community: According to a Gallup poll, nearly two-thirds of all Americans support Black Lives Matter protests and nearly half say the demonstrations have altered their views of racial justice.",
            "The BREATHE Act, argues Garza, “is actually speaking to the majoritarian values that I think are not only being expressed through these rebellions, but are also being expressed through the ways that people are showing up to participate in cities and states across the country.” ",
            "“The movement is making impact and the question becomes, how will our elected representatives and those who seek our votes step up to meet this moment?” she added.",
            "With this in mind, the goals of the Black National Convention are not only to encourage support of the BREATHE Act, but of Black movement work, writ large. The convention will stream on the evening of the 57th anniversary of the March on Washington and on the heels of another police shooting of a Black man, Jacob Blake, in Kenosha, Wis. Organizers hope that by creating a program where Black communities are front of mind, they can garner the support they need to continue organizing across the country and make possible the changes they’ve been advocating for decades.",
            "“This is for everyone who has ever seen the story of someone who lost their lives to police and knew that it was unjust. For someone who maybe came to their first protest this year. It's for the person who hasn't gone out to a protest at all but sees the hashtag or sees the conversation,” Reed explained.",
            "“This is not for politicos. This is not for people who are entrenched in partisan politics or party politics. This is for everyday people to understand that our movement is for everyone, that all Black people have the right to be alive and thrive in our communities. And we are fighting for that.”",

        "body": [
            "The president tried hard to soften his image on race. But can four nights of testimonials make up for four years of stoking racial divisions?",
            "Tim Scott waxed about his family arc — \"from cotton to Congress in one lifetime\" — and invoked George Floyd and Breonna Taylor. Nikki Haley spoke of her Indian roots and alluded to her decision to take down the Confederate flag. Herschel Walker said he's seen \"racism up close\" — and it's not Donald Trump.",
            "For a president credibly accused of stoking racial fears and divisions throughout his term, Trump, with his choice of speakers, leaned hard into the topic during the first night of his convention on Monday. One Republican after another defended Trump’s record on race, while highlighting Joe Biden's race-related gaffes and history pushing the 1994 crime bill. ",
            "All told, it was a surprising amount of attention paid to an issue typically associated with Democrats.",
            "But even as speakers such as Scott and Haley attempted to soften Trump's image on race — while essentially making the case that the racial justice movement has gone too far in its views of policing — others took a harder-edged tack that undercut the message of inclusion. In an ominous presentation that warned suburbanites that their safety is at risk if Democrats win, Mark and Patricia McCloskey, the couple who pointed guns at Black Lives Matter protesters outside their home in St. Louis, made clear that the president's outreach would go only so far.",
            "“What you saw happen to us could just as easily happen to any of you who are watching from quiet neighborhoods around our country,” Patricia McCloskey said. “Make no mistake: No matter where you live, your family will not be safe in the radical Democrats’ America.\"",
            "The Republican convention opened amid another round of mass protests over a police shooting of a Black man, this time in Kenosha, Wis. With voters of color backing Biden by staggering margins, most Black speakers downplayed criticisms of Trump poor record on race by recounting their own personal experiences with him.",
            "“Growing up in the Deep South, I’ve seen racism up close, I know what it is, and it isn’t Donald Trump,” said Walker, the former NFL player, who said he has known the president for 37 years, when the then-business mogul bought the New Jersey Generals pro football team. ",
            "Walker said that Trump cares about social justice, and “keeps right on fighting to improve the lives of Black Americans.” ",
            "Georgia state lawmaker Vernon Jones, a self-proclaimed lifelong Democrat, also vouched for the president and maintained that his support is growing among Black Americans who feel they're not being served by Democratic politicians. ",
            "“The Democratic Party does not want Black people to leave their mental plantation,” Jones said. \"I have news for Joe Biden: We are free, we are free people with free minds, and I'm part of a large and growing segment of the Black community who are independent thinkers, and we believe that Donald Trump is the president that America needs to lead us forward.\"",
            "Republicans pointed to Trump's accomplishments on issues affecting Black Americans, such as increasing funding for historically Black colleges and universities, supporting minority-owned small businesses and signing into law the First Step Act, a criminal justice reform bill pushed by his administration. ",
            "Polls show Biden with a 75-point lead over Trump among Black voters on average, and Trump is polling at 8 percent among Black voters. But if he can close the gap with Biden even slightly, the president's advisers think it could make the difference in several swing states. ",
            "Republicans also seized on Biden's gaffes and generalizations on the campaign trail as examples of Democrats' ineptitude. ",
            "“Joe Biden said if a Black man didn‘t vote for him, he wasn't truly Black. Joe Biden said Black people are a monolithic community. It was Joe Biden who said poor kids can be just as smart as white kids,“ Scott said, before pointing to Biden‘s leading role in crafting the 1994 crime bill, which contributed to mass incarceration. ",
            "Trump, meanwhile, “signed into law historically high funding for [historically Black colleges and universities], as well as a bill to give them permanent funding for the first time ever,“ Scott said in the final speech of the night. ",
            "Haley, a fellow South Carolinian who served as governor and the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, also challenged Democrats‘ views on race. ",
            "“In much of the Democratic Party, it‘s now fashionable to say that America is racist,” she said. “That is a lie. America is not a racist country.” ",
            "“The American people know we can do better. And of course we value and respect every Black life.“ ",
            "The Covid-19 election is here and both parties have reimagined their conventions. This week, it's the Republicans' turn. Check out our 2020 national convention page for the latest news, video, live interviews and analysis.",
            "Kim Klacik, who is running for the Congress in the Baltimore district long held by civil rights advocate Elijah Cummings, sounded a similar note, saying that the “days of blindly supporting Democrats are coming to an end.” ",
            "“Joe Biden believes we can’t think for ourselves, that the color of someone’s skin dictates their political views,” Klacik said, condemning Democrats' leadership in Baltimore (a frequent target of Trump).",
            "Yet it's far from clear that a four-night convention can counter four years of fodder Trump has provided to critics. Just last week, POLITICO reported on a recording of a private meeting in 2017 at which Trump acknowledged that lower turnout among Black voters benefited him in the2 election. ",
            "“Many Blacks didn’t go out to vote for Hillary ’cause they liked me,” he told a room of civil rights leaders. “That was almost as good as getting the vote, you know, and it was great.”"

            "Despite repeated talk of structural racism, Black Lives Matter activists want Democrats to \"close the gap between symbolism and substance.\"",
            "Joe Biden gave the floor to George Floyd's brothers and Eric Garner’s mother on the first night of his convention. On the third night, Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama spoke the words “Black lives matter,” and Kamala Harris bemoaned the damage done by “structural racism.”",
            "The embrace of the movement against racial injustice was a dramatic shift from the party's last convention four years ago and did not go unnoticed by Black Lives Matter activists. But its leaders viewed the gestures as mostly lip service, without a real commitment to policy change: They want Biden to commit to defund the police and to crack down on misconduct by law enforcement.",
            "“It’s been unfortunate to not see the Democratic Party fully align themselves with the powerful work this movement has been doing,\" said Patrisse Cullors, who helped found the BLM movement in 2013 after the killing of Trayvon Martin.",
            "The disappointment underscores the persistent divide between Biden's campaign and many BLM activists, even as they present a united front to oust President Donald Trump. It also showcases the careful line Democrats are attempting to walk: While the BLM movement has gone mainstream, most Americans tell pollsters they don’t support withholding money for police. ",
            "Biden is trying to straddle the demands of the movement without alienating swing voters. He spoke about the “stain of racism” in his nomination address without offering policy prescriptions. Though Biden likely stands to benefit politically from the seismic shift in support for Black Lives Matter, he kept the most activist element of the movement at bay during the four-day convention — even as he highlighted Republican politicians supporting him for president. ",
            "Biden’s campaign worked with progressives on police reform in the weeks leading up to the convention. On the first night, the virtual gathering focused on racial injustice, featuring a roundtable with the nominee on police violence and speeches on racism and inequality from Washington, D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser and House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn. ",
            "But many of the figures chosen to address systemic racism are the same politicians being targeted by the movement with pressure campaigns. ",
            "“It took seven years for Democrats to articulate that Black lives matter. Now, the country is watching to see if and how they will close the gap between symbolism and substance,\" said Alicia Garza, another co-founder of the BLM movement and head of the voter engagement group Black Futures Lab. ",
            "Garza and other movement leaders pointed to Democrats’ rejection of language aimed at limiting police abuses that activists pitched for the party’s platform. And the Biden campaign’s calls to “rein in” qualified immunity — which gives cops legal protections against civil suits brought by victims’ families for misconduct — have left many activists wondering what exactly he's proposing.",
            "Monifa Bandele, a leader in the Movement for Black Lives coalition, a coalition of more than 150 Black-led organizations, said she was heartened by the inclusion of Gwen Carr, the mother of Eric Garner, in Monday’s lineup. Garner was killed by police in 2014. Bandele said the party should listen closely to Carr’s pleas for national legislation on police brutality.",
            "“Don't just give [Carr] the microphone, make sure that what she says on the microphone translates to a written commitment by the party,” Bandele said. “You can have a lot of talking heads at a convention saying a lot of great things, but unless you put it down on paper that these are the issues that we commit to addressing, moving forward with the new administration, then it's performative.” ",
            "Activists are reacting to what they see as Biden’s election strategy: embracing the larger goal of the BLM movement while courting swing white voters who want to address racial injustice but don’t think defunding the police is the answer. ",
            "“I may be kidding myself but I think the people are ready” for change, Biden said during the racial justice roundtable. Though Biden’s approach irks progressives — many bristled when he said “most cops are good” — it also frustrates the right. Trump’s campaign has simultaneously tried to cast Biden as a tool of the left whose administration would defund police, and a tough-on-crime politician who hasn’t changed his ways. ",
            "“I don't expect him to suddenly sound like a member of ‘The Squad,’” said progressive Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii), referring to the group of firebrand House liberals that includes Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. “I expect him to build coalitions, listen, and get progressive change done. But if someone's expecting him to turn into Bernie Sanders, that's not going to happen.”",
            "Schatz said Biden’s creation of “unity” task forces with Bernie Sanders as a way of bridging policy differences with progressives was “very senatorial” — using bipartisan techniques to collaborate with opposing forces in the party.",
            "“Joe Biden is very effective at advancing the ball, but not feeling the need to fall into or even jump over every trap,\" Schatz added. ",
            "In one critical battleground state, Pennsylvania, Democratic operatives said Biden’s support of the BLM movement and statement at the convention that “most cops are good” made sense politically. Internal polling shows Black Lives Matter and the Fraternal Order of Police are both popular in the swing state, but defunding the police is not, said a Democratic strategist based there.",
            "Symone Sanders, a senior adviser to Biden, said the campaign is listening to activists but pushed back on the criticism that the party was insincere in its approach. ",
            "“I don't think George Floyd's brother, Philonise, thought that it was performative that he was participating in the Democratic National Convention, not a couple months after the horrific killing of his brother,” Sanders said in an interview.",
            "Still, Cullors, a longtime leader in the movement, clashed with Biden’s campaign while Democrats were drafting the party's platform. ",
            "Biden's team told Bernie Sanders’ aides they wanted Cullors to withdraw amendments to the platform that she introduced supporting the BREATHE Act, according to Cullors and other people familiar with the deliberations. The proposal would eliminate federal programs that are \"used to finance and expand\" law enforcement. As a compromise, she was offered the opportunity to give a speech instead, which she did.",
            "\"I don't think any of it was acceptable,\" Cullors said of the trade-off. \"Every single amendment was turned down.\"",
            "In the speech at a meeting of the convention’s platform committee, she laced into the Democratic establishment, asking, “Can any of you here truly stand up and say, 'My party is the party of principles'?\"",
            "During the convention, the Movement for Black Lives Electoral Justice Project released an open letter to the Democratic National Committee, which it said was signed by 10,000 people, calling on it to support the BREATHE Act and defunding police. ",
            "At the same time, Cullors and other Black Lives Matter leaders praised the Democratic convention for showcasing diverse speakers and highlighting racial justice, and said they will work to elect Biden.",
            "Progressives and BLM organizers have also questioned Biden’s position on qualified immunity, a rule supported by police unions that shields cops from misconduct lawsuits. The Biden campaign has said repeatedly he supports “reining in” qualified immunity, but provided few specifics on what that would look like. ",
            "By contrast, the Justice in Policing Act passed by the House and co-led by Biden’s vice presidential nominee Harris, would end qualified immunity. A recent Pew Research poll found two-thirds of Americans effectively want to do away with the doctrine.",
            "Sanders’ appointees sought to abolish the rule when negotiating criminal justice reforms with Biden’s camp on the unity task forces. Biden, who backs decriminalization of marijuana, has also resisted calls from progressives and moderates to legalize it.",
            "“Those are the reforms we were demanding a decade ago,” said Bandele, senior vice president of mothers’ advocacy organization MomsRising. “2020 demands more. Reining it in, I don’t even know what that means.” ",
            "Symone Sanders defended Biden’s position on qualified immunity as an “intentional and thoughtful one.” She said Biden’s views on the topic differ from the provisions in the Justice in Policing Act, which the campaign considers “just a start.” Biden has applauded some aspects of the legislation.",
            "“There are a number of things in that bill that he absolutely supports wholesale, like a ban on chokeholds for example,” she said. “But it's true that the House bill does not exactly mirror our policy and the vice president's perspective. But what is also true is this — that we think criminal justice reform and police reform should be a bipartisan issue.” ",
            "She added that Biden believes “qualified immunity as it stands today for police officers is too expansive,” and that “there are a range of activities that should not be covered,” such as chokeholds. The campaign said “abuses of power” should not be protected either, but declined to elaborate.",
            "Carr, Garner's mother, said in an interview that she participated in the roundtable at the invitation of Biden's team. She acknowledged that racism received more attention than at previous conventions, but wants more specifics.",
            "“There's a lot of things that I would like to sit down and talk to Biden and his team about,” she said. “A lot of times things are addressed, but then that's where it's left.”"

            "The bills up for debate in Sacramento would rewrite rules around how police officers manage protests, when they must disclose misconduct and, most critically, what violations could lead the state to strip officers of their certification or penalize them for excessive use of force. One bill would go as far as requiring officers to physically restrain colleagues who step out of line.",
            "The combined weight of the legislation would amount to an unprecedented law enforcement overhaul in the nation’s most populous state, where decades of tough-on-crime politics have given way to ambitious sentencing reductions under Democratic control in the state Capitol.",
            "Major legislative actions in California regularly inspire similar moves in statehouses around the country — a function of the state’s population size and influence.",
            "A sweeping worker classification bill spurred similar state measures, while a data privacy law preceded pushes in more than a dozen other states. And California accelerated a national movement against cash bail in 2019, although its ban faces a referendum in November.",
            "Since Floyd’s death on May 25 in Minneapolis, New York enacted long-sought changes to police misconduct disclosure requirements and Colorado passed a landmark bill to end qualified immunity, a legal shield for officers that has become a national target for reform. Virginia convened a special session this week focused on policing.",
            "But the outcome in California this month will test the reform movement’s durability — and if Democrat-dominated California cannot succeed, advocates say, that will send a discouraging signal about law enforcement’s enduring power to dilute or derail reforms.",
            "“If we can’t do it here, that begs the question: can Democrats do this? Are Democrats serious about reforming policing?” said Kate Chatfield, a senior policy adviser at the Justice Collaborative, a policing reform organization. “Voters are incredibly supportive of this, so if our electeds can’t get this done, we need some new electeds.”",

            "Democrats will still face a powerful law enforcement lobby that has blocked bills in the past and holds sway among some moderates. And time is short in the Capitol, with less than two weeks left to broker complicated changes in police rules during a condensed session that was supposed to focus almost entirely on coronavirus legislation.",
            "Eric Nunez, president of the California Police Chiefs Association and chief of the Los Alamitos Police Department, said that he understands the legislative sense of urgency, but he’s concerned that hastily crafted legislation will create more questions than answers for officers in the field.",
            "He said that prior to the state shutting down in March in response to the pandemic, CPCA was tracking eight policing bills, a number he called manageable. After Floyd’s death in May, that number had jumped to 25 bills.",
            "“It's just not, it's not conducive to really doing all the research, all the back and forth that has to occur to hammer out this language,” Nunez said. “And I don't know where it's all going, but those are the things that we're concerned about, the structural impediments from Covid-19 and then the urgency because of the murder of George Floyd.”",
            "Even before Floyd’s death, shifting public sentiment had brought law enforcement groups like CPCA to the negotiating table.",
            "After opposing an attempt to raise California’s standard for when peace officers can use lethal force, law enforcement worked last year on landmark legislation that established new use-of-force and officer training policies.",
            "“Law enforcement clearly saw the tide change,” said Assemblymember Tim Grayson (D-Concord), one of the co-sponsors of McCarty’s bill.",
            "Those changing dynamics have recruited some unlikely allies to the cause — Grayson among them. He was formerly a Republican and a police chaplain, a template for the type of centrist Democrat who might have been reluctant to imperil his reelection by antagonizing law enforcement.",
            "But Grayson also represents the district where law enforcement shot and killed Willie McCoy and Sean Monterrosa under disputed circumstances. He has called for an independent investigation and allied with Monterrosa’s family to pursue a bill, opposed by law enforcement, entitling victims of police violence to remuneration.",
            "“I know that I have been a part of a system that has perpetuated systemic racism and injustice,” Grayson said in an interview. “I will tell you,” he added, “that system is falling to the power and strength of the voices of a community that has come together united.”",
            "While McCarty said “many in law enforcement are much more open to these changes than we saw in the last 5 to 10 years,” he noted that leadership-driven groups like the police chiefs have been more receptive than groups representing rank-and-file officers or sheriffs, who tend to be more conservative.",
            "Of all the goals energizing activists, rooting out wayward police officers sits high on the list — but it won’t be easy.",
            "A measure sponsored by state Sen. Steven Bradford (D-Gardena) would decertify officers who are convicted of crimes like falsifying records, bribery and excessive force. Bradford introduced the measure after Attorney General Xavier Becerra called for Sacramento to create a statewide decertification process.",
            "Another measure would require officers to intercede when they see excessive force being used by a fellow officer. An officer that fails to do so could be held criminally liable and face decertification.",
            "Federal law requires officers to intervene when they see other colleagues violating someone’s civil rights, and many police departments have similar mandates on the books. But those safeguards have often failed in practice, advocates say — most glaringly with Floyd’s death in Minneapolis. The California bill would go further by disqualifying officers from serving if they have failed to intervene.",
            "Peter A. Hanink, a sociology professor at California State Polytechnic University, Pomona who studies law enforcement force policies, said he was only aware of one other state, Connecticut, creating the type of broad liability the California bill would impose.",

            "“If it happened once, it's happened before; if it's happened before, it will happen again,” Holden said, referencing the Floyd killing. “So we have to make sure that we start to take some affirmative actions, to make appropriate changes in partnership with law enforcement.”",
            "In his time pursuing police reform in Sacramento, ACLU lobbyist Cuevas-Romero said he has “never” seen this type of momentum, which he attributed in part to law enforcement “trying to save face and trying to seem relevant and seeing the writing on the wall.” But Cuevas-Romero warned against complacency.",
            "“In the world we’re living in in 2020, we don’t know what’s going to be the next big issue,” he said. “Covid could continue to dominate, and that may suck up the space, and legislators may have to shift to that.”"

        "title": "How the Supreme Court Dropped the Ball on the Right to Protest ",
        "body": [
            "Over the years, courts have carefully updated our speech protections while mostly ignoring the freedom of assembly. Now they may have a chance to change that.",
            "In recent months, American cities have seen widespread protests denouncing police brutality against unarmed Black people. Local and national law enforcement agencies, responding to crowds of unprecedented size and scale, relied on methods that were equally unprecedented. In Portland, federal officers unleashed torrents of tear gas and paintballs, pulled protesters into unmarked vans and severely injured one demonstrator in front of a federal courthouse. ",
            "Police in Orlando, Chicago, New York, and other cities resorted to the use of long-range acoustic devices (LRADs), a weapon frequently used by the U.S. military in sonic warfare and one with the potential to cause permanent hearing loss to those exposed to it. Other tactics were harsh enough to cause severe injuries, such as loss of vision, in at least 12 reported cases. National Guard helicopters hovered dangerously close to protesters in Washington, capturing images and videos of the crowds, kicking up shards of broken glass and sending many looking for cover. ",
            "For many Americans, this seemed to be exactly how the federal government is not supposed to respond to demonstrations in a country that has a constitutionally protected freedom of assembly. To be sure, in some cases, the harsher tactics were in response to outbreaks of crowd violence, including attempted arson of local police buildings in cities such as Portland. But independent expert reviews of police responses showed a clear pattern in which use of excessive force by the police escalated many confrontations. And to many watching at home or on the street, the police response was widespread enough in cities that it appeared the line between how law enforcement responds to mob violence and how it responds to regular assembly had been blurred. ",
            "There’s a reason for that: For more than 30 years, the Supreme Court has failed to take up a freedom-of-assembly case. As a result, this fundamental constitutional right is in sore need of an update, such as a ruling that would protect protesters from the unduly harsh police response that has become all too common as a response to demonstrations in recent years.",
            "The First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution explicitly describes the right of the people to peaceably assemble. This right is recognized separately from the right to freedom of speech because the founders believed that the act of organizing a large crowd for a demonstration, parade or protest could be more powerful than individual speech, and was therefore even more susceptible to government encroachment. Like the right to religious expression, the founders gave the right to protest its own listing intending for the courts to give it special treatment and fashion unique legal standards that would ensure its protection. This has happened with the other specifically enshrined rights. With free speech, for example, the Supreme Court has in recent years defined specific kinds of modern speech—computer code, or speech on the internet—and protections for them. ",
            "But over the past 50 years, the courts have ducked that responsibility to protect the freedom of assembly, laying the groundwork for the hyperaggressive police response to protests that is observed in the streets today.",
            "The Supreme Court shirked this responsibility first by holding that the right to assembly did not protect anything like the right to protest in the streets, beginning with a formative ruling in 1886. At the time, labor unrest and revolt were widespread, and many state governments were passing laws aimed at preventing potential insurrections by workers’ organizations. It had also become common practice for state police and troops to violently disperse labor union meetings and demonstrations, and in response to this practice, many labor groups began arming their members. When one group of German-American socialist workers organized a parade in Chicago, in which members carried unloaded rifles, members of the group were prosecuted for marching in the streets without a license from the governor. In addition to claiming that their Second Amendment right to bear arms had been violated, the members claimed that by marching in the streets, they were exercising their right to assembly. ",
            "The Supreme Court ruled that the right to assembly did not give a blanket right to protest in the streets. Instead, the court ruled that the First Amendment protected the right to speak to the government only through activities such as forming a political group or lobbying Congress. In effect, the justices subsumed the right to protest within the more expansive right of freedom of speech, suggesting that the right to protest would be subject to the same protections as individual speech. ",
            "But that’s not what happened. In fact, the court has over the years declined to protect the right to protest with one of the most important legal standards they have used to protect freedom of speech: the chilling-effect doctrine. This doctrine, first used by the Supreme Court and then frequently cited afterward in free-speech decisions in lower courts, holds that fear of government punishment can deter free expression as strongly as application of actual punishment. In cases involving individual speech, the courts rely on the chilling-effect doctrine to prohibit government action that makes people afraid to speak on a certain topic.",
            "The origins of the chilling-effect doctrine go back to the Cold War. The U.S. government knew that it could not prohibit individuals from producing communist literature or joining communist organizations without violating the First Amendment right to free speech. Instead, to achieve the same goal, states and federal government passed laws that would have revealed to the government the identity of those sympathetic to the communist cause. For example, state employees were asked to take an oath of allegiance to the government of the United States, and those wanting to receive communist literature were asked to give their information to the U.S. Postal Service before receiving such material through mail. ",
            "Although none of these actions would have directly punished individuals for expressing their beliefs, the Supreme Court was quick to see the new threat they posed to the freedom of speech. It was enough, the Court ruled, that these requirements created an atmosphere of fear around certain expressions and that many might self-censor in the future out of fear of punishment. The Supreme Court found both of the above-mentioned laws to be unconstitutional in two separate rulings, citing the chilling-effect doctrine. ",
            "The court had already made the suggestion earlier that the freedom of assembly was essentially an extension of the freedom of speech, which would also seem to mean that the chilling-effect should apply to the freedom of assembly, too. But that is not how courts have ruled. For decades, lower-level courts ignored requests to apply the chilling-effect doctrine to harsh crowd-control tactics, finding the advocates’ plea that such practices can impact future participation in protests to be tenuous. ",
            "The courts’ failure to update Americans’ understanding of the freedom of assembly has given law enforcement free rein to deploy strategies that increasingly have the potential to deter future participation in protests. This is nowhere more evident than in the type of the cases that make their way to the courts. Whereas 10 years ago the courts had to decide whether NYPD’s use of mounted police that frequently stepped on protesters’ feet was objectionable (they decided that it was not), today they hear cases about armies of special forces equipped with riot gear, chemical weapons and other top-level military-grade weaponry. Every step of this transformation in policing crowds has been fueled by the courts’ refusal to rein in the proclivity for an increasingly stronger show of force. ",
            "But a slew of new cases gives the courts a new chance to revisit many of the faulty assumptions that have long bedeviled their approach to the right to protest. ",
            "This month, Oregon Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum, sued the federal government over the exercise of harsh protest-suppression methods in Portland. Rosenblum asked the federal court to declare such “police-state tactics,” to be unconstitutional, citing its potential to have a chilling effect on future lawful participation in protests. Similar lawsuits have been initiated by local activist groups in Chicago and in Minneapolis. In other cities, such as Seattle, legislative authorities are filling the gaps left by the courts, banning the use of nonlethal weapons, such as acoustic weapons and chemical irritants. In Oregon, Rosenblum’s request was blocked due to standing—meaning that someone else will have to raise the issue—and the pace of the other decisions will likely be slow because of the pandemic.",
            "But the courts could finally have a chance to revisit the role they have played in shaping the slow eradication of the right to protest in the United States, the right that gave us the march to Selma and the women’s vote. And we should hope that this time, they find it worth protecting."

            "They’ve worked in other countries. In the middle of a national reckoning on race, some advocates are wondering: Why not here?",
            "In a South African courtroom in 1995, a woman let out a scream so bone-chilling in its distillation of anger, injustice and grief that decades later it still rings in the ears of those who were present. The woman was Nomonde Calata, who was 26 years old and pregnant with her third child in 1985, when her husband, the schoolteacher and anti-apartheid activist Fort Calata was abducted and brutally assaulted by apartheid government security forces. When his body was found days later, it had been completely burned. ",
            "Calata’s scream cut through her testimony to South Africa’s Truth and Reconciliation Commission, which had been established to adjudicate the brutal, racist tactics used by the country’s apartheid government. Her testimony—and that of thousands of other victims of apartheid—was broadcast on television and radio, entering the homes of hundreds of thousands of viewers worldwide. It was recorded to help ensure that the crimes of apartheid would not be forgotten, and should never be repeated.",
            "In countries around the world, the public airing of stories like Calata’s has been seen as a necessary way to acknowledge and ultimately move past systemic injustices. Over the past 50 years, this process—usually called a truth and reconciliation commission, though some use the words “justice” or “dignity”—has become one of the most important tools in healing national division. Employed in various forms in at least 46 countries—from South Africa to Peru to Canada—these commissions have a track record of helping societies to at least begin to move beyond otherwise intractable problems, including dictatorship (Argentina), genocide (Rwanda), civil war (El Salvador), ethnic conflict (Solomon Islands) and revolution (Tunisia). ",
            "If ever there has been a time for the United States to undergo a similar process, there’s a strong argument that moment is now. This spring, the police killing of George Floyd and several other Black Americans offered a painful reminder of the persistence of racism across American history and society. The resulting Black Lives Matter protests have been declared the largest political movement in U.S. history, with 10 percent of the population attending, across all 50 states. And recent polls show that 76 percent of Americans now consider racism and discrimination a “big problem,” an increase of 26 percentage points from 2015. ",
            "The depth of division over race in the United States—and the growing calls for change—suggest to some activists that the moment demands something bigger than a “national conversation.”",
            "“In all of my 72 years, almost all of which I’ve been working as an activist, I’ve never seen anything like this,” says Fania Davis, director of the nonprofit Restorative Justice for Oakland Youth. “We are beginning to disrupt centuries of denial of our collective biography during this time. Whenever you have such an intense crisis, it also presents an opportunity for significant or revolutionary change.”",
            "And yet, with some exceptions, the idea of a national, formal reconciliation process has not been a central part of the discussion about how the country can move forward, and few politicians are pushing such a measure. ",
            "Why not the United States too? The activists and experts I spoke with, some of whom have worked on truth commissions in other countries, pointed to several obstacles: extreme partisanship; lack of political buy-in, or the imagination to look outside the United States for inspiration; a long history of injustice, as opposed to a singular, dramatic event; and the systemic, widespread nature of racism in Black American life. But smaller-scale versions of reconciliation have worked here before, and at least three American cities are beginning to undertake their own reconciliation efforts, which activists hope could generate grassroots support for a larger effort.",
            "Ultimately, the countries around the world that have launched truth commissions did so in spite of these kinds of challenges—widespread disapproval, political tension and occasionally violence.",
            "“In the U.S., we have the resources to do this,” says Jaya Ramji-Nogales, a Temple University law professor focused on human rights. “It’s just a question of political will.”",
            "The first truth commissions began in the late 1970s in Latin America as fact-finding missions to uncover truths about dictatorships and military juntas; Argentina’s 1983 National Commission on the Disappeared is considered the first well-publicized commission.",
            "Although they are not a cure-all, truth commissions historically have helped societies to address collective trauma and abuse. According to the International Center for Transitional Justice, an international human rights group, the common features of such commissions include “the recognition of the dignity of individuals, the redress and acknowledgment of violations, and the aim to prevent them from happening again.” ",
            "“There are certain best practices,” adds Kerry Whigham of the Auschwitz Institute for the Prevention of Genocide and Mass Atrocities. Whoever is responsible for setting up the commission, its makeup should be politically independent, Whigham says, and must include victims or members of targeted groups, who, he says, “have to determine what the structure of the commission looks like, what the mandate is, what recommendations to give.”",
            "The process might sound like a courtroom proceeding, but the goal is starkly different. Rather than hard findings of guilt or innocence, the idea is to create a safe forum to air grievances and enter into the public record, as a form of both collective catharsis and, ultimately, accountability. Victims are not cross-examined, but are allowed “to speak their truth in their own words, as opposed to being directed or controlled by a larger purpose or narrative,” says Ronald Slye, a law professor at Seattle University who served as a legal consultant to truth commissions in South Africa and Kenya. Or as Anna Myriam Roccatello, the ICTJ’s deputy executive director, puts it, “The victims become protagonists.” ",
            "South Africa is the country that’s most often held up as an example of a successful truth and reconciliation commission. Desmond Tutu and Nelson Mandela, two figures who carried weight both domestically and internationally, spearheaded the seven-year process. Over that time, the commission—made up of 17 high-profile activists and political figures, supported by 300 staff members—collected 21,000 victim testimonies, of which 2,000 were publicly broadcast. For many white South Africans, it was the first time they had heard, in such detail, the physical and psychological harm Black South Africans had endured during apartheid. After the commission finished its work, it produced a report, as is customary, with recommendations including reparations, reformation of the political and social sectors, and, in some cases, prosecution of perpetrators.",
            "But the commission was not entirely a success. Some victims are still waiting on financial reparations; and South Africa’s police force still disproportionately brutalizes Black citizens. Because perpetrators were allowed to exchange testimony for amnesty, many victims felt that justice had not been served. And while only 1,000 of the 7,112 perpetrators were granted amnesty, none was prosecuted. Mandela made a point not to alienate white South Africans in an effort to unite the country, and South Africa would later be criticized for focusing too much on reconciliation at the expense of victims. ",
            "Even as most truth commissions have achieved some tangible results, Roccatello explains, such mixed outcomes are hardly atypical. “Even if you have the best energy at the beginning, the commissions rarely continue evenly and consistently,” she says. “You take one step forward and three steps back. … What really makes the difference is the incredible never-ending resilience of victims.”",
            "Some Western countries attach a stigma to truth commissions—they are for failed or failing states, the thinking goes. But the United States, in fact, has experimented with such commissions in the past.",
            "In 1980, Congress set up the Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians in order to investigate the relocation and internment of Japanese Americans and Japanese nationals during World War II, culminating in reparations of $20,000 paid to each survivor, as well as education initiatives and a public apology from Congress. ",
            "In 2004, the Greensboro Truth and Reconciliation Commission investigated the death of five protesters during an anti-Ku Klux Klan rally in 1979. While the commission gave a platform to survivors to share their stories, it did not get the support of the city of Greensboro. “Ultimately the predominantly white City Council rejected the TRC process and the commission's 500-page report—in the end, only offering a statement of regret,” notes the Carnegie Council.",
            "The ongoing Maryland Lynching Truth and Reconciliation Commission, which was established in 2019 with bipartisan support in the state Legislature, researches cases of racially motivated lynchings and holds public meetings and regional hearings about them. As part of the commission, individuals can also speak about their ancestral connection to lynchings, from both victims’ and perpetrators’ perspectives. (During the Covid-19 pandemic, the public meetings have moved to publicly accessible conference calls.) ",
            "These initiatives, however, have had narrower mandates than would a national truth and reconciliation commission around racism—its long history in the United States, its persistence into the present and the millions of living Americans who could be considered victims. That daunting sense of scale might be one factor pushing against a nationwide initiative on race in the United States: For a commission to work as a mechanism of both truth-telling and justice, it would need to address issues ranging from the history of slavery to school segregation to policing to employment and wealth disparity. ",
            "Perhaps the closest domestic model to date for a national effort is President Bill Clinton’s 1997 “initiative on race”—set up to address racism through a “candid conversation on the state of race relations today,” as the White House billed it. Clinton appointed a seven-member advisory board tasked with meeting the initiative’s goals of “study, dialogue, and action,” through town hall meetings, educational initiatives, promoting community dialogue and concrete recommendations. But the initiative was dismissed as largely symbolic and lost momentum as Clinton’s personal scandals grabbed the country’s attention. ",
            "Any new initiative would need to take more concrete actions, activists say. In the United States, it’s difficult to imagine a truth commission on race that wouldn’t prosecute police officers, for instance. Black people account for 28 percent of police murders but only 13 percent of the population, and in 99 percent of police killings from 2013-19, officers were not charged with a crime, according to data from the research and advocacy group Mapping Police Violence.",
            "Today’s heightened partisanship presents another obstacle. While Congress would not need presidential support to set up a national commission on racism, the transitional justice experts I spoke with were in agreement that the current divided Congress isn’t likely to launch any such initiative, nor is the Trump administration likely to support one. “The idea that there could be these processes at any level that wouldn’t be weaponized by the right and the left is not mindful of our current reality,” says Peter T. Coleman, professor of psychology and education at Columbia University who studies intractable conflict and sustainable peace.",
            "There are more intangible factors, too—including denial. “People in the U.S. refuse to make the connection between slavery, Jim Crow and all the institutional racism going on currently,” says Ereshnee Naidu-Silverman, a South African-born senior program director at the International Coalition of Sites of Conscious, a global network of sites and initiatives that memorialize victims of atrocities. “In the U.S., we very often deny things that are right in front of us and think America is the exception to many things that are occurring every day,” adds Dina Bailey, CEO of Mountain Top Vision, a consulting company that helps organizations become more inclusive.",
            "To get political buy-in, Whigham, of the Auschwitz Institute for the Prevention of Genocide and Mass Atrocities, says pressure would need to come from the grassroots: “Generally speaking, governments don’t have it in their personal interest to create something that could destabilize those personal interests.”",
            "And there are some signs that this kind of grassroots support is growing—and is reaching the halls of power. In early June, Congresswoman Barbara Lee (D-Calif.) announced legislation calling for the establishment of the first United States Commission on Truth, Racial Healing, and Transformation. The legislation has been backed by 146 lawmakers, though all are Democrats. (Before he died last month, Congressman John Lewis voiced support.)",
            "On June 30, the district attorneys in Boston, Philadelphia and San Francisco announced they would each create commissions to address racism and police brutality, with plans to launch as early as this fall. The initiatives are backed by The Grassroots Law Project, a group co-founded by activists Shaun King and Lee Merritt to advocate on behalf of Black men and women who have been killed by police or wrongfully convicted. ",
            "In March, after two white men killed Ahmaud Arbery, a 25-year-old Black man in Georgia, King, who previously lived in South Africa and had already worked with Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner, began exploring the idea of establishing a city-based truth, justice and reconciliation commission, he said in an interview. He approached Krasner, followed by the district attorneys in Boston and in San Francisco, who also signed on. The commissions, which will each function separately, are in the early phases of working with local communities to figure out what their mandates and structures will be. Reparations, prosecution and official pardons by state prosecutors are among the ideas on the table, King says.",
            "King previously has been accused of mismanaging funds for other advocacy efforts, allegations he denies. The Boston, Philadelphia and San Francisco commissions will be jointly staffed and funded by the DA offices and Grassroots Law. “We want to create compassionate pathways and ecosystems for truth to be told and shared and valued, [in ways] that earnestly do not exist right now,” King says. “We think we can create alternative definitions of what justice really means. … For some families, that may mean helping to set new policies to prevent what happened to their loved ones to someone else. Getting a sincere seat at the table is a form of justice for some people.”",
            "Some advocates argue that this kind of local approach might ultimately be more effective than a national commission. “People’s concept of justice is not homogeneous,” says Naidu-Silverman. ",
            "Fania Davis of the Restorative Justice for Oakland Youth points to the work community organizers have done in schools, prisons and other parts of the community, including organizations like MPD 150 in Minneapolis, and Showing up for Racial Justice. “We can’t rely on existing systems or governments to lead these processes,” she says. “If these processes are hierarchical, or top-down, or government-centered, we will just create a new future of hierarchy and systems of dominations.” ",
            "“We need to do truth-telling for quite a while still,” she says. “But the dam is broken.”"

        "body": [
            "The battle to define the movement comes as the president and fellow GOP candidates try to win back suburban voters.",
            "For a brief moment after George Floyd was killed by a Minneapolis policeman in late May, some members of the GOP joined calls for change as protests exploded onto streets across the country. That moment is over. ",
            "Facing possible electoral calamity, Republicans are now turning to a familiar playbook: stoking fear by trying to redefine the Black Lives Matter movement as a radical leftist mob looking to sabotage the white, suburban lifestyle.",
            "Republicans are using two lines of attack: the Trump administration, candidates in safe red seats and right-wing social media channels seek to label the entire movement “Marxist” and anti-family as they try to energize their conservative base. Republicans running in swing districts and states, meanwhile, are tying their Democratic opponents to activists’ demands to defund police departments, while avoiding explicitly mentioning Black Lives Matter. Instead, Republicans running in competitive general election races have focused recent ads on more abstract targets like “left-wing radicals\" and the \"liberal mob.\"",
            "It’s a distinction Democratic pollsters and lawmakers attribute to the dramatic shift in public views on police brutality, and who and what people associate with the declaration that “Black Lives Matter.” The new broad support for the movement, they say, makes it harder to tie Black Lives Matter to one person, organization or ideology.",
            "“People putting ‘Black Lives Matter’ signs on their lawns, it's not an endorsement of a particular organization so much as a value statement uniting a lot of people from many backgrounds,” said Democratic Rep. Tom Malinowksi, whose predominantly white New Jersey district was held by Republicans for decades before he won in 2018. ",
            "That hasn't deterred Republicans, who have increased their criticism of the movement over the past month. On the same day President Donald Trump tweeted that Black Lives Matter was “a symbol of hate,” his personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, declared to a group of reporters at the White House that \"Black Lives Matter is a Marxist organization … Black Lives Matter has been planning to destroy the police for three years.” ",
            "Other Trump administration officials and Republican lawmakers, particularly those running in tough primaries, followed suit, warning, in addition, that the movement wanted to destroy the “nuclear family.” Fox News hosts, conservative talk radio personalities and think tanks such as The Heritage Foundation joined in, as well. Prager University’s “Black Lives Matter is a Marxist Movement” video released this month has over a million views on YouTube and is one of several popular videos it has produced on the topic.",
            "So far, the GOP attempts to discredit the movement have yet to stick. With just under three months until the election, Black Lives Matter has won mainstream support across racial and partisan lines that would have been almost unthinkable six months ago. But the battle to define the movement is not over, as Trump bets he can turn the suburbs, lost to Republicans in 2018, in his favor by attempting to cast a movement for racial equality as a threat to white voters. ",
            "“We recognize that this is not simply an issue fight, this isn't simply a narrative war — what we think we're experiencing is a social and cultural and political realignment,” said Maurice Mitchell, national director of the Working Families Party and a leader with the Movement for Black Lives coalition. “We continue to give that backlash the adequate concern and respect one would give any dangerous opponent, even one that clearly is on the wrong side of history.”",
            "Though Black Lives Matter is a decentralized ecosystem that encompasses more than 150 organizations, Trump’s allies are trying to wed the entire movement to the personal beliefs of a pair of self-described Marxists who formed the Black Lives Matter Global Network in 2013, in the aftermath of the killing of Trayvon Martin. Many other supporters and leaders organizing under the Black Lives Matter banner — which is now considered to be the largest racial justice movement in the history of the country — don’t identify with Marxism.",
            "Trump-endorsed Tennessee Senate candidate Bill Hagerty told POLITICO that Black Lives Matter wants to see the “destruction of the nuclear family.” Speaking to a TV pundit with ties to white supremacy, Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler recently attacked WNBA players for promoting the \"Black Lives Matter” message and has repeatedly used the Marxist tag. ",
            "Conservative critiques are based on the fact that two founders of Black Lives Matter Global Network, Patrisse Cullors and Alicia Garza, are self-declared Marxists — a description Cullors used in a 2015 interview. Republicans have also criticized language on the network's website which says one of its missions is to “disrupt the Western-prescribed nuclear family structure requirement.”",
            "Garza and Cullors first made the #BlackLivesMatter hashtag go viral after the acquittal of Martin's killer. Their group also owns BlackLivesMatter.com and has been an advocate of defunding the police. ",
            "“Yes, I’m trained in different economic philosophies,” Cullors said in a statement through a spokesperson, but added, “I refuse to be reduced to a single clip from an interview that was manipulated for white supremacist and right wing fear mongering.” She declined an interview.",
            "Melina Abdullah, a Pan-African Studies professor at California State University, Los Angeles and head of BLM's LA chapter, wrote the passage on the nuclear family that is featured on the BLMGN website. Abdullah explained that it is an “affirmation of the African principle that it takes a village to raise a child. It's invoking the idea that all of us are responsible for our collective children.” ",
            "Republican efforts “to assail that statement actually has opened up an important conversation within the Black community,” Abdullah said. “It hasn't had the backlash that I think that they wanted it to have.”",
            "In a sign that the Marxism tag might already be falling flat, Giuliani took his attacks a step further Thursday, falsely accusing BLM activists of being terrorists. \"These are people who hate white people,\" Giuliani said on Fox News. \"These are killers.\"",
            "Some Republican strategists believe that the combination of early summer riots, the controversial stances of some BLMGN members, plus the mainstreaming of “defund the police,” have given them an opening to diminish Democrats' current electoral advantage. Democrats and BLM organizers point to the polls, describing the GOP strategy as a nakedly racist last gasp that won’t gain traction outside the right-wing echo chamber.",
            "“The average voter in that swing suburb is not thinking about BLM as [select] leaders of the movement,” said Jefrey Pollock, president of polling firm Global Strategy Group, who works with Democrats in swing House and Senate races. “They're thinking about the larger conversation that is happening about African Americans and racial injustice.”",
            "At the moment, more than 60 percent of Americans support the movement, according to recent polls. And 62 percent of white people say minorities are not treated equally in the criminal justice system — up 18 points since 2014. ",
            "Voters in urban areas support the BLM movement by 73 percent, suburban voters by 62 percent and rural voters by 54 percent, according to July Navigator research done by GSG and GBAO Strategies provided to POLITICO. ",
            "One senior Republican strategist noted, however, that while support continues to be high, opposition to the BLM movement spiked 9 points in July, according to Civiqs.",
            "Ian Prior, a Republican strategist working to unseat swing district Democrat Rep. Matt Cartwright in Scranton, Pa., acknowledged that BLM is difficult to campaign against but argued that the movement — and Democrats supporting it — has given Republicans an opening on supporting police. ",
            "“Explaining the difference between the Black Lives Matter movement versus the Black Lives Matter sentiment — there’s nuance there and nuance is hard in politics,” he said. “But support for law enforcement, that’s not nuanced and that’s where I think you’ll see a lot of the Republican messaging in tough races.”",
            "So far, Republican candidates who are currently airing ads have mostly refrained from directly naming the BLM movement. In ads that aired from May 25 to the end of July, only one GOP ad in a primary race used the words “Black Lives Matter,” while saying that liberals don’t care about Black lives, and another used the term “violent thugs,” according to an analysis provided by Ad Analytics. ",
            "But as primaries pass — dragged out because of the pandemic — and general election races ramp up, Democrats in vulnerable seats are bracing for more Republicans to step up their attacks.",
            "“I actually stood up in front of 1,500 people at a Black Lives Matter rally and said explicitly that I disagree with the ‘defund the police’ slogan,” Malinowksi said. “And it will not stop them from accusing me of defunding the police because that's just the Republican talking point everywhere this year.”",
            "Though, notably, Malinowksi’s Republican opponent, state Sen. Thomas Kean Jr., attended a BLM rally this summer. ",
            "Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden has walked a similar tightrope — embracing protesters’ urgent condemnations of racial injustice without backing some of their proposed solutions, such as calls to “defund the police.” ",

            "For students on scholarships from Africa, racism is an everyday reality.",
            " Kasia Kovacs is a freelance journalist and writer based in London and Budapest. ",
            "BUDAPEST — For African students studying in Hungarian universities, the recent wave of protests that swept across Europe in response to the killing of George Floyd in the United States was a reminder of the uneasy position they occupy in their adopted country.",
            "Many have come to Hungary on scholarships to study in prestigious higher-education programs that offer them a temporary entry-way into Europe. The program, which is not widely known locally though it is funded by tax-payer money, has brought thousands of African students to the country’s universities on scholarships for the past 50 years.",
            "Still, the number of African residents in Hungary remains small — some 7,200 people, according to 2020 data — and a general lack of diversity coupled with anti-immigrant sentiment stoked by Prime Minister Viktor Orbán’s right-wing government means racism is an everyday reality for many of them. Some report they have been spat on, called racial slurs and heard strangers make monkey noises as they walk by.",
            "So when a group of African students, along with other expats and local Hungarians, gathered outside the U.S. Embassy in Budapest in June in solidarity with anti-racism movements in other countries, few were surprised to see counter-protesters appear carrying signs that read “White lives also matter” and chanting “Hungária.” Although the small group of hecklers was peacefully dispersed, the incident is symptomatic of the lack of awareness of racial issues in the country and everyday taunts, they say.",
            "\"It happens every week, at least,\" Maveens Okwudiri Okwunwa, a Nigerian communications student at Budapest Metropolitan University, said in an interview in central Budapest, referring to the racism he experiences living in Hungary. As we spoke, a man shouted \"Ape! Ape!\" at him in the background.",
            " * * *",
            "Hungary’s decades-old scholarship program for African students is seemingly at odds with its more recent hardline position on immigration.",
            "In European debates on the relocation of asylum seekers, the Hungarian government has blocked efforts to relocate refugees across Europe. It was also one of the first countries to close its borders and adopt unapologetic anti-immigrant rhetoric centered on protecting Hungarian Christian values from outsiders.",
            "Orbán’s government has also gone to battle with Central European University, which has a large number of international students, over alleged foreign influence — a conflict that led to the relocation of several CEU programs to Vienna.",
            "The two policies — welcoming students from over 60 countries via scholarships and taking a staunchly anti-immigrant approach when it comes to refugees — “do not seem coherent,” said István Tarrósy, a professor of political science and African studies at the University of Pécs.",
            "And yet, recently, Hungary has ramped up its outreach to Africa. Last year, the government announced it would offer scholarships to about 900 African students to study at Hungarian universities — in addition to the 1,710 Africans who already received scholarships that year — as part of its “Africa Program.”",
            "The scholarship program has its roots in the Cold War. Like many countries in the Eastern bloc, Hungary admitted several African students starting in the 1960s. Between 1964 and 1967, the number of African students in Hungary rose from 198 to 398.",
            "The push was initially designed as a type of educational and ideological exchange that would help the socialist country open up to the world. Many of the students who were part of those first waves of scholarships put down roots in the country and still live there with their families.",
            "\"The thousands of African professionals who graduated from Hungarian universities in the '70s and '80s form an unbreakable link between our country and the continent,\" the state-sponsored Budapest Africa Forum said in a statement in 2013.",
            "In more recent years, the Hungarian government has sought to create more ties to Africa, including through investments, which it frames as a way to stabilize volatile regions from which people would otherwise flee, seeking to better their fortunes in Europe. (It has also invested in Latin America and the Caribbean, following a similar logic.)",
            "Pursuing a strategy of opening up to the south, including through trade ties, to ensure “fast growth” will “help dissuade potential migrants from leaving their homes,” Foreign Minister Péter Szijjártó said in 2015.",
            "Since the height of the refugee crisis — when some 67,000 asylum seekers passed through Hungary in the first six months of 2015 — the issue of immigration has dominated political discourse in the country.",
            "The scholarships fit into the country’s goal of “controlling immigration,” said Dr. Elżbieta Goździak, a professor of migration studies at Georgetown University, who added that it was about choosing what type of person is allowed into the country and, crucially, how long they can stay.",
            " * * *",
            "The word \"migrant,\" or \"migráns\" in Hungarian, once had a neutral connotation. In fact, Hungarians rarely used the word before 2015, according to research by Ildikó Barna, a sociologist at Eötvös Loránd University who has tracked the government’s role in stoking prejudice against foreigners.",
            "It was only in the wake of the refugee crisis, Barna's research found, that migrants were largely depicted as a threat to public security. It’s a shift that has created a surge in xenophobic rhetoric and “fear of the other,” said Tarrósy, the African Studies professor.",
            "\"There is a huge prejudice against Black individuals,\" Barna said, because many Hungarians may not necessarily differentiate between migrants and people who look like they could be migrants, including Africans who moved to Hungary by choice or received scholarships to study at local universities.",
            "\"Even for people who are half-Black and speak Hungarian as I do, they frequently meet prejudice.\"",
            "Indeed, for many Black people living in Hungary, the government’s anti-immigrant rhetoric plays out on an intimate level in their daily lives. They speak of verbal taunts, being turned away from restaurants and bars, trouble with neighbors and flatmates and difficulties finding work.",
            "Tobi Ojo was shocked when an older woman spat on him at a train station, days after he moved to Hungary from his native Nigeria in 2015. He was 16 at the time and about to begin a degree in electrical engineering at the University of Debrecen.",
            "\"I finally understood what it meant to be Black in a different place,\" Ojo said.",
            "Things got worse when he started looking for a job. A permit gave him seven months to find employment in Hungary — but even with top grades, he had no luck. A friend at an engineering firm where Ojo had applied for a job eventually told him in confidence, \"honestly they don't want any Black people in their company,\" Ojo recalled.",
            "Okwunwa, the communications student, said he regularly notices that people treat him with suspicion. He stopped going to IKEA after consistently being followed around the store by security guards, and moved out of one apartment because an older neighbor frequently called the police on him “for no reason,” complaining that his footsteps “were too loud.”",
            "Once, the neighbor reported a bomb threat when a friend temporarily left her luggage in the building’s lobby and Okwunwa returned home from class to find police searching his apartment.",
            "Both men have resigned themselves to ignoring the noises directed at them on the street. \"What can you possibly do?\" Okwunwa said. Both men also plan on leaving Hungary to pursue graduate degrees in countries where they believe they have more opportunities.",
            "Racism is not always overt, said Daniel Anyim, who came to CEU from Ghana in 2018. He occasionally notices Hungarians staring at him on the tram, but for the most part, he said, people approach African students with a \"live and let live\" attitude.",
            "Some African students say they live in a bubble of fellow international students, with whom they speak English, and rarely interact with locals.",
            "According to Tarrósy, attitudes are changing among younger generations, who are less likely to support anti-immigrant rhetoric and are also more aware of anti-racism movements in other countries thanks to social media.",
            "In university towns especially, many Hungarians realize that foreigners stimulate the local economies and add to their communities, Tarrósy said.",
            "For Ojo's part, the anti-racism protests in June have given him a sense of optimism for the future. \"It was definitely a great thing to see, knowing that it wasn't even a minority that organized it definitely breeds hope for the future.\""

        "body": [
            "The Minnesota freshman and \"Squad\" member faces criticism that she’s too divisive to effectively represent her district.",
            "Rep. Ilhan Omar is one of the best-known Democrats from the class of 2018, a lightning-rod member of the Squad whose outspoken liberal politics have made her an enemy of Donald Trump.",
            "Back home in Minneapolis, however, her polarizing national profile is complicating her bid to win a second term.",
            "Facing a political newcomer who raised a jaw-dropping $3.2 million last quarter — much of it from pro-Israel donors who oppose Omar’s foreign policy stances — Omar suddenly finds herself on the defensive against claims that she’s too divisive to effectively represent the solidly Democratic district.",
            "“We don't need someone distracted with Twitter fights,” said primary challenger Antone Melton-Meaux, who pledges to focus on local issues and avoid the spotlight. “I don't want to be a celebrity. I want to serve the people, and people are tired of the politics of division and distraction.”",
            "The first Black Muslim woman to serve in Congress, Omar has built an image as a progressive champion who isn’t afraid to stand up to Trump. The president, in turn, has frequently singled out the freshman lawmaker, disparaging her as an anti-Semite, an “America-hating socialist” and falsely claiming that she publicly supports al Qaeda.",
            "A Somali refugee who is the first member of Congress to wear a hijab, Omar was attacked in xenophobic terms by Trump in 2019 when he encouraged her and other members of the Squad to “go back” to where they came from. As a result, supporters rallied around Omar in the district, which is the most strongly Democratic in the state.",
            "Yet many constituents have been alienated by her comments about Israel. Omar has been accused of anti-Semitism after suggesting support for Israel was popular due to campaign donations, that pro-Israel lawmakers had dual allegiance to both the U.S. and Israel and Israel had “hypnotized the world.”",
            "“Rep. Omar's past comments invoked age-old anti-Semitic tropes and rhetoric that echoed and brought about the nightmares of persecution,” said Rabbi Avi Olitzky, who leads a congregation in the district.",
            "Olitzky threw his support behind Melton-Meaux, who has spoken out about Omar’s comments about Israel, and said the challenger brings desperately needed conflict resolution skills to the political climate.",
            "University of Minnesota political scientist Larry Jacobs said Omar’s comments have infuriated the district’s small but influential Jewish community.",
            "“You've got an opponent who is playing on these divisions with resources to build his name recognition and take the fight to Omar,” Jacobs said. “Can she counter that with less money and with political skills that have not been impressive to this point?”",
            "A significant swath of the Fifth District’s Jewish community has an uneasy relationship with Omar, according to Steve Hunegs, the executive director of the Jewish Community Relations Council for Minnesota and the Dakotas. But Hunegs added the community is not monolithic and some progressive Jews are behind the incumbent.",
            "Omar voter Liz Loeb said as a Jewish person, she was hurt by Omar’s rhetoric, but does not think the lawmaker is anti-Semitic.",
            "“I need a representative that advocates for, and cares about and understands the experiences of people who are marginalized within communities,” Loeb said.",
            "Allies of the first-term lawmaker say Omar has reached out to the Jewish community and point to her apology in 2019. In a sign of her support from the national party establishment, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi endorsed Omar earlier this month — a year removed from Pelosi’s rebuke of the congresswoman.",
            "Omar is also backed by former Rep. Keith Ellison, who vacated the seat when he ran for Minnesota attorney general in 2018. Omar won an open, six-candidate primary that year with 48 percent of the vote and triumphed in the general election by nearly 60 percentage points.",
            "Still, pro-Israel bundlers are making her defeat a priority this cycle, angered by her support for the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement. And Melton-Meaux has been backed by pro-Israel PACs who oppose Omar’s foreign policy stances. A super PAC that backs America’s alliance with Israel is even starting to air Omar attack ads in the district.",
            "A previously little-known Black mediation lawyer, Melton-Meaux produced a second quarter fundraising haul that dwarfed Omar’s tally of $471,000.",
            "Omar allies like Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party Chairman Ken Martin criticized Melton-Meaux for receiving “big special interest money.”",
            "“You can judge someone’s values by where they're taking money from and who's fueling and funding their campaigns,” Martin said.",
            "Jeremy Slevin, Omar’s communications director, hit back at claims that Melton-Meaux is a unifier and criticized his past work as a corporate lawyer representing employers.",
            "“I feel pretty strongly that the image he is presenting in his primary challenge is bogus,” Slevin said.",
            "Slevin also took issue with Melton-Meaux’s casting of Omar as out of touch with her congressional district and in search of the limelight.",
            "“I think it's demeaning for someone to suggest that because a leader is subject to routinely racist and xenophobic attacks from the president, that they are therefore seeking celebrity,” Slevin said.",
            "Although Melton-Meaux’s substantial fundraising numbers catapulted him into contention for the seat that encompasses Minneapolis and its first-ring suburbs, Omar is still viewed as the favorite in the Aug. 11 primary.",
            "The congresswoman’s recent internal polling showed her leading Melton-Meaux 66 to 29 percent, with a 74 percent approval rating. The Melton-Meaux campaign blasted the poll as methodologically flawed but declined to share specifics from their own polling.",
            "Melton-Meaux said his message, which centers around criticizing Omar for her voting record and her controversial comments on Israel, is resonating.",
            "He called out Omar’s vote against the USMCA trade deal and present vote on a resolution condemning the Armenian genocide. And he ripped her for missing nearly 5 percent of votes during her first term.",
            "Martin, the DFL Party chairman, said he was confident Omar would win next month’s primary, backed by the state party’s support and what he said was a groundswell of voter mobilization following the police killing of George Floyd -- which occurred two miles from Melton-Meaux’s home.",
            "Melton-Meaux noted that the incident led him to reflect on his experiences with law enforcement. As a law student at the University of Virginia, Melton-Meaux said police detained him for a crime he did not commit.",
            "“I know without a shadow of a doubt, but for a few circumstances, that could have been a knee on my neck,” he said. “So to see former Officer Chauvin snuff out the life of George Floyd over eight and a half minutes in broad daylight in the city that I love was heartbreaking.”",
            "Minneapolis lawyer Don Lewis, who is endorsing Melton-Meaux, says his main issue with Omar isn’t her controversial comments on Israel, but her lack of connection with the district’s needs. Lewis, who is Black, said he views Melton-Meaux as an effective coalition builder whose background as a descendant of African enslaved people is meaningful.",
            "Melton-Meaux is betting on more voters like Minneapolis resident Pam Goldfarb Liss in order to win on Aug. 11. She supported Omar in 2018 and consistently votes the DFL party line. But now, she says she is voting for Melton-Meaux because she feels Omar is more concerned with fighting Trump than standing up for her constituents.",
            "“I would like to have a mild-mannered representative who builds bridges and gets things done for Minnesota instead,” Goldfarb Liss said. "

        "body": [
            "Lawmakers say it could make meaningful change across government — but far more slowly than protesters would like.",
            "Amid a national reckoning on the injustices faced by Black Americans, Congress has so far agreed on just one response: Study the problem.",
            " The House this week approved a bill to create a first-of-its-kind federal commission to examine the impact of systemic racism on Black men and boys — a long-time priority of the Congressional Black Caucus that gained momentum after George Floyd’s death at the hands of police in May.",
            " The bill, which now goes to President Donald Trump’s desk after passing the Senate last month, is expected to become the first piece of legislation signed into law as a result of months of protests over police brutality. But some fear that it could be the last, at least until after the November election.",
            " “This is an important first step in the right direction,” House Democratic Caucus Chairman Hakeem Jeffries said in a brief interview after the bill passed Monday. “Much more will need to be done, consistent with the bills that have already been acted upon by the House.”",
            " Democrats and Republicans have hailed the 19-member commission as a long-overdue way to begin tackling decades of lingering racism toward Black men, starting with policy recommendations across the government. The group, hand-picked by leaders in Congress and the administration, would look broadly at disparities on everything from incarceration rates and drug abuse to school performance and health.",
            " Many lawmakers acknowledge that the legislation isn’t enough to address protesters’ demands for an immediate overhaul of the nation’s law enforcement practices. But with Republican leaders resisting Democratic proposals for broad reforms, the commission is likely to be the most far-reaching policy to go into effect in the coming months.",
            "Still, the legislation could have a long-term impact.",
            " “It’s a very progressive and aggressive bill,” Rep. Frederica Wilson (D-Fla.), the bill’s long-time champion, said in an interview, adding that it’s intended to look at the deep-rooted effects of racism in the lives of Black men and boys, and not just policing. It would be housed within the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights.",
            " “When people approach a Black boy on the street, they cross the street. If a Black man gets in an elevator, people get off,” Wilson said. “All of these systemic racist scenarios as it relates to being a Black man and existing in America make me want to scream.”",
            " Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), who shepherded the bill on the Senate side, said the forum created to discuss these issues “could turn out to be very meaningful.”",
            "“People will look at commissions and kind of roll their eyes,” he added. “But the various factors that are contributing to the academic, economic, societal underperformance, typically among African American boys and men, needs to be better understood.”",
            " The commission, while an accomplishment for a Congress that seems to agree on little these days, is a far cry from the sweeping changes lawmakers in both chambers were pursuing in June, as the nationwide racial injustice protests dominated the news.",
            "But that momentum quickly came to a halt after the Senate failed to advance a bill in late June — likely dooming any meaningful action on police reform until after the election or next year. Once again, a Congress that only seems to function when facing a deadline-fueled crisis, failed to answer the calls of Americans demanding change.",
            " While protesters are still in the streets of many major cities, lawmakers have quickly pivoted to the next looming crisis — in this case, the latest coronavirus rescue package. But even that effort is sputtering as Senate Republicans continue to bicker over their own proposal and the parties remain far apart. ",
            " Democrats say key lawmakers, led by CBC Chairwoman Karen Bass, are privately still trying to enact more sweeping police reforms after this summer’s stalemate. But several lawmakers and aides are skeptical that a bipartisan agreement can be reached and signed into law anytime soon.",
            " In the meantime, the House and Senate have turned to a less contentious option — the commission — which was opposed by just a single lawmaker in both chambers: GOP Rep. Mo Brooks of Alabama.",
            " Wilson, the bill’s original author, said she hopes the council will focus on some of the issues addressed in the House Democrats’ policing bill, like the use of chokeholds by police. The CBC would likely have power over the direction of the commission, given that a half-dozen of its members, including its chair, would sit on the panel.",
            "The House’s sweeping policing bill, named after George Floyd, sought to end racial profiling in law enforcement and curb the use of force through provisions like a ban on chokeholds and “no-knock” warrants, stronger data collection on misconduct, and limits on the use of military equipment.",
            " Senate Republicans, meanwhile, had written a bill to incentivize local police departments to refrain from tactics like chokeholds, but without strict requirements. That bill, largely drafted by the GOP’s lone Black senator, Tim Scott of South Carolina, was ultimately blocked by Senate Democrats, who said it was crafted without their input and didn’t go anywhere near far enough. ",
            " Wilson, a former school administrator, has spearheaded the idea of a commission on Black men and boys since her days on the Miami-Dade county school board nearly 30 years ago. Eventually, she took her fight to the state legislature and helped enact a state-wide model with the help of Republicans like Rubio, who was then speaker of the Florida House.",
            " This year, Rubio introduced the companion version of Wilson’s bill alongside Sens. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) and Cory Booker (D-N.J.). It was unanimously approved by the Senate in late June, shortly after the Senate GOP’s police reform efforts collapsed.",
            " The House passed its version of the commission bill on July 27, the same day that the late Rep. John Lewis — who had also long advocated for the measure — lay in state in the Capitol Rotunda.",
            " “For me, it was like an out of body experience that this bill was passing as John was being transported to lie in state in the Capitol,” Wilson said. “It was a chilling confluence of events.”",

            "The unrest Saturday and early Sunday stemmed from the weeks of protests over racial injustice and the police treatment of people of color that flared up after the May 25 death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Floyd, who was Black and handcuffed, died after a white police officer used his knee to pin down Floyd's neck for nearly eight minutes while Floyd begged for air.",
            "In Seattle, police officers retreated into a precinct station early Sunday, hours after large demonstrations in the city’s Capitol Hill neighborhood. Some demonstrators lingered after officers filed into the department’s East Precinct around 1 a.m., but most cleared out a short time later, according to video posted online.",
            "At a late-night news conference, Seattle police Chief Carmen Best called for peace.

About 20 minutes later, federal officers and local police could be seen attempting to clear the area and deploying tear gas, however protesters remained past 2:30 a.m., forming lines across intersections and holding makeshift shields as police patrolled and closed blocks abutting the area.

        "title": "'It’s my constitutional freaking right': Black Americans arm themselves in response to pandemic, protests",
        "body": [
            "Conservatives are using images of Black protesters with guns to justify their calls for law and order. ",
            "When coronavirus lockdowns spread nationwide in March, millions of Americans flocked to their local grocery stores and wholesale markets to stock up for what would become months stuck at home. Black Americans did the same, but some had one addendum to their shopping list: a firearm. ",
            "Since the beginning of the pandemic, there has been growing interest among African Americans in arming themselves, as evidenced by increased membership in Black gun owner organizations. ",
            "That interest ballooned in the wake of George Floyd’s death, which reignited debate about public safety and the role of police in Black communities. Sensationalized stereotypes about Black Americans and guns, however, are also being used by critics of the anti-racism protests to justify a security crackdown in urban areas, many with large Black communities. ",
            "The rush to purchase weapons and ammunition is not unique to one race — more Americans across the board are arming themselves this year, including those who are not legally eligible. However, new Black gun owners see firearms as a tool of both empowerment and self-defense. ",
            "Philip Smith, president of the National African American Gun Owners’ Association, said his organization’s annual membership has increased by much as 2,000 new members per day — a figure he used to see annually. His organization has grown to more than 30,000 members this year and has an online following of nearly 90,000 people.",
            "The influx of interest in gun owning — and seeking membership in Black gun owner organizations — began as soon as the pandemic set in. Fears of a damaged economy, disrupted supply chain and slow-moving federal response inspired people to take up arms. ",
            "\"If you have a half a brain in your head even saying, 'Oh, this might get serious, let me plan accordingly,\" Smith explained.",
            "The Floyd protests, he added, were a “line in the sand” for many of his new members. Leaders of other Black gun ownership organizations echo this response, saying the spike owes to a range of concerns many Black Americans have.",
            "\"Whether it was fear of a food shortage, lack of a grocery store, the short response times for law enforcement or whether people were just fearful they were going to be attacked, I don't know,\" said Derrick Morgan, national commander of the Black Gun Owners Association. Morgan said interest in his group grew so quickly that his website crashed from a surge in online traffic.",
            "\"A lot of people are reaching out to us, mainly new gun owners and people who wouldn't have considered owning a gun or firearm for their protection, have been lining up to purchase firearms and access information from our website.\"",
            "Their reasoning has become much harder to ignore, especially as social media sites and phone videos turned into tools of capturing and responding to instances of police brutality. Floyd’s death catalyzed international protest in part for this reason. The video of Ahmaud Arbery, who was killed by white vigilantes in a Georgia suburb garnered similar levels of attention, as did that of Atlanta’s Rayshard Brooks, who was shot in the back by a police officer after a confrontation. ",
            "While the vast majority of demonstrators across the U.S. this summer have been unarmed, some have sought to make a statement with their guns. In Stone Mountain, Ga., an open carry state, at least 150 African Americans asserted their Second Amendment Right as a tool of protest. Dressed in black and armed with semi-automatic rifles, the group marched through Stone Mountain Park to protest its depiction of Confederate generals. ",
            "A similar march organized by black gun owners took place in Oklahoma City in June, timed to President Donald Trump’s rally in nearby Tulsa. Smith said his organization is not affiliated with such groups but empathizes with their members.",
            "“Any time any community has been pushed and pushed like ours has been pushed, I may not agree with what you do as another organization, but I certainly understand where that stems from,” he said, adding that the groups' efforts were done out of “survival and being able to protect your community.”",
            "Their demonstration and others have drawn the ire of some conservatives. Georgia Sen. Kelly Loeffler decried the “mob rule” in Atlanta during a June 24 interview on Fox News, as the cable network played images of Black protesters carrying semi-automatic weapons. “We’re a nation of the rule of law and this is exactly what will happen if we defund the police,” Loeffler warned.",
            "Her rhetoric echoes that of the White House and other Republicans in Washington, who have taken an increasingly antagonistic tone towards protesters and members of the Black Lives Matter movement over the past month.",
            "Trump has referred to the movement as a \"hate group\" and repeated talking points in favor of tough policing. The president and his supporters, meanwhile, defended a white St. Louis couple captured on video pointing guns at Black protesters marching by. According to Fox News, the couple told police they retrieved their firearms after spotting armed protesters.",
            "Other members of his circle have taken to calling Black Lives Matter protesters \"Marxists\" who have been \"planning to destroy the police for years.\"",
            "Attempts to fan fears of armed, militant Black Americans is not a new political tactic. In 1969, FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover described the Black Panther Party, which advocated for African Americans to take up guns as a form of self-defense, as \"the greatest threat to internal security of the country.\" Concerns about the group in the late 1960s even prompted the National Rifle Association, no fan of gun restrictions, to partner with California Gov. Ronald Reagan to pass gun control legislation that limited open carry at the state capitol.",
            "Now, as the Trump administration prepares to expand its military presence to major cities, their talking points are turning into policy. After a week of violent crackdowns on protests in Portland, President Trump announced his plans to deploy hundreds of federal law enforcement agents to Chicago and Albuquerque to “help drive down violent crime.” ",
            "The federal government has also threatened to deploy federal forces in Baltimore, Detroit, New York, Oakland and Philadelphia — all of which have large Black populations.",
            "The White House has specifically cited gun violence in African American communities and the threat of damage to federal property as an excuse for the increased military presence. ",
            "Black gun owners of this era, however, maintain that their firearm ownership is not evidence of something more sinister, nor is it the violent show of force that some conservatives have made it out to be. ",
            "“It’s my constitutional freaking right,” said Kat Traylor, a political strategist and licensed gun owner based in Aurora, Colo., the site of one of the most violent mass shootings in American history. ",
            "Traylor said she feels empowered by owning a firearm. At the same time, she is a member of the Moms Demand Action group, which advocates for gun control legislation. In 2018, she helped push through the state’s Red Flag Law that gives judges the power to seize a person’s firearm if they prove to be a danger to themselves or another person. ",
            "“We tussled with the idea of having guns in our home because we've advocated so many gun rights legislation,” she explained. “We were like, yeah, we need this law because we don't need guns in the hands of people that are clearly going to hurt themselves or others.”",
            "Traylor is not the only person who has struggled with the implications of owning a gun as a Black American. With shootings on the rise in several American cities, advocates are wary of the trend, saying there isn’t enough evidence to prove that guns will make Black Americans safer.",
            "“What I really want people to think about is the impact of the presence of guns in Black communities and how there are inherent challenges and more nuanced challenges to saying ‘everyone should arm themselves,” said Amber Goodwin, founder and executive director of the Community Justice Action Fund, which aims to prevent gun violence in communities of color. “Not everyone has access to gun safety. We don't know how guns can actually make Black people safer in the home or outside of the home.”",
            "Black gun ownership advocates, who prioritize safety and proper training over rushed and potentially dangerous efforts to obtain weapons, say their growth in numbers sends a powerful message beyond those from Stone Mountain, Oklahoma City, Aurora or any individual city. ",
            "“The days are over of African Americans sitting around singing Kumbaya and hoping and praying that somebody will come and save them. We're gonna save ourselves,” Smith said. “And any politician that wants our vote moving forward, they better be on the side of our thinking otherwise, you're not gonna get our vote. We're not gonna be sheep anymore.”"

        "body": [
            "Court rejects bid by Oregon AG to require feds to identify themselves before whisking suspects from city streets.",
            "A judge on Friday denied the Oregon attorney general's request for a temporary restraining order to rein in the activities of federal agents responding to protests and unrest in Portland. ",
            "As part of a lawsuit against federal agents in the city, Oregon Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum had requested that federal officers clearly identify themselves when seizing protesters and stop arrests without probable cause. ",
            "But U.S. District Court Judge Michael Mosman rejected the motion, arguing that she did not present enough evidence that future harm would continue at the hands of the agents. The judge also raised doubts about whether the state had legal standing to pursue a suit on behalf of protesters or others who might be targeted by the federal officers.",
            "The decision comes a day after another federal judge ruled in a separate case that federal agents would have to stop using force on journalists reporting on the protests.",
            "Federal agents from the Department of Homeland Security and the U.S. Marshals Service arrived in Portland as protesters marched on the city in the wake of George Floyd's death. Several reports and videos shared on social media showed agents clad in camouflage seizing activists from city streets and whisking the protesters away in unmarked vehicles. The agents also reportedly used force on journalists to clear them from protest areas.",
            "Videos of the agents show the uniforms are clearly marked as \"POLICE\" but activists say it is often unclear what agency the armed officers represent. The military gear and attire evokes fear and suspicion, critics say. ",
            "The agents appear to be part of what court filings have described as a \"rapid deployment force\" that is part of \"Operation Diligent Valor,\" a Department of Homeland Security-led effort to protect federal courthouses and office buildings from vandalism, arson and other damage.",
            "Last week, Rosenblum sued the agents, listed as John Doe 1-10, and a number of federal agencies, accusing them of violating protesters' constitutional rights by arresting them without probable cause. David Morrell, an attorney for the federal government, argued before the court that Rosenblum's motion for a temporary restraining order was based on \"a few thread witnesses and a Twitter video.\"",
            "In a 14-page ruling Friday, Mosman wrote that Rosenblum's case was a \"highly unusual\" one that does not meet the standards for a temporary restraining order, particularly for barring future conduct rather than harm already done to protesters. Mosman wrote that Rosenblum only used two examples of what she characterizes as unlawful seizures and did not present enough evidence that the seizures are likely to continue.",
            "\"The State could try to show, for example, that all of Defendants’ seizures are illegal, or that they are under orders to fail to identify themselves or to make random arrests without probable cause,\" Mosman wrote. \"The state has shown none of this. It has presented no evidence of any official orders or policies and has presented no evidence that these allegedly illegal seizures are a widespread practice.\"",
            "Mosman also faulted the state’s lawyers for hyperbolic arguments, including describing those arrested as being “disappeared,” which the judge said evoked the mass murder of tens of thousands of political opponents by a military junta in Argentina in the 1970s and 1980s.",
            "“Even taking every word of the State’s arguments and evidence at face value, this seems out of proportion,” wrote Mosman, an appointee of President George W. Bush.",
            "Rosenblum later issued a statement pushing back on Mosman's doubts on the state's ability to sue on behalf of the protesters. Protesters can sue for individual damages, she said, but cannot sue to stop what she called the unlawful conduct of federal agents in the future.",
            "\"Today’s ruling suggests that there may be no recourse on behalf of our state, and if so that is extremely troubling,\" Rosenblum said.",
            "She added: \"While today the court declined to issue an immediate order putting a stop to those tactics, we are, nevertheless, hopeful these abuses will stop and no other Oregonians will be subject to them or to the chilling effect they have on the right to engage in peaceful protest.\"",
            "Mosman's order came hours after the Justice Department announced federal charges against 18 protesters in connection to demonstrations at a federal courthouse in Portland. Those charges included assaults on law enforcement officers, destruction of property, looting, arson, and vandalism. ",
            "Late Friday, another federal judge blocked Seattle’s new law prohibiting police from using pepper spray, blast balls and similar weapons that was passed following confrontations with protesters, according to the Associated Press.",
            "The Seattle Times reports that U.S. District Judge James Robart at an emergency hearing granted a request from the federal government to block the new law, which the Seattle City Council passed unanimously last month.",
            "The U.S. Department of Justice, citing Seattle’s longstanding police consent decree, argued that banning the use of crowd control weapons could actually lead to more police use of force, leaving them only with more deadly weapons.",

        "title": "How a New Wave of Podcasts Is Shaking Up Chinese-Language Media ",
        "body": [
            "Small non-state outlets are building a community of like-minded progressives among young Chinese people and challenging the state’s grip on coverage of the United States and the world.",
            "On June 21, a new podcast appeared on several Chinese and American podcast platforms, including Apple Podcasts. Called In-Betweenness, it was recorded by four academics scattered around the world.",
            "The podcast is in Mandarin, and the target audience is Chinese people, but the topic was race in America and across the world—specifically, what’s happening to race relations in the wake of the George Floyd protests. The hosts, based in the United States, Asia and Europe, didn’t shy away from difficult issues. They started the conversation with how Chinese people were characterized as “yellow” in a world order that still favors white Europeans, and ended it with a look at anti-Black racism in China.",
            "Some listeners complained that the first episode was “too theoretical and abstract”—the discussion touched on the French philosopher Frantz Fanon’s criticism of Hegel’s master-slave dialectic—but that didn’t prevent people from tuning in. Since it launched, the podcast has racked up 17,000 downloads in eight countries plus Taiwan and Hong Kong. That might seem a drop in the bucket relative to the 1 billion Mandarin speakers worldwide, but the podcast’s goal isn’t to go mainstream. Instead, it aims to open up space for progressive conversation and build community among a select group of Chinese-speaking people, highly educated and many of them young, who might go on to have influence over politics and policy. Over 60 percent of the audience is in China. ",
            "“I wasn’t surprised by the geographical distribution of our audience,” says Chenchen Zhang, a co-host of In-Betweenness who teaches politics and international relations at Queen’s University Belfast. “But I was a bit surprised by the number of downloads.” ",
            "In-Betweenness marks a new trend in the Chinese media landscape. All media in China, state and commercial, is closely monitored and heavily censored pre- and post-publishing. Under publishing laws and regulations, nonstate digital media is not allowed to conduct original reporting and publishing. At best, they are aggregators. State censorship of social media platforms such as WeChat and Weibo, now the primary news sources in China, has become increasingly sophisticated. The state has also cracked down on private software to circumvent the Great Firewall.",
            "But a wave of independent Chinese-language media platforms, based mostly outside of China—podcasts like In-Betweenness, as well as blogs, newsletters and video series—has sprung up in recent years to cover America and the world for a Chinese-speaking audience. Most of the audience are educated millennials living in cities in China and abroad, and most of the platforms can be accessed anywhere in the world, including China. Even if some episodes are removed by government censors from podcast stores in China, people can still access it by subscribing to RSS feeds.",
            "In the increasingly fraught relationship between China and the United States, these new projects amount to a kind of third information channel, one neither controlled by the Chinese state nor the America-centric Western media in English. It includes In-Betweenness; the podcasts Loud Murmurs, Stochastic Volatility and New York Culture Salon; News Lab, a newsletter run by Kecheng Fang, a journalism professor based in Hong Kong; and an independent blog run by Yan Wang, a conservative-turned-liberal popular blogger who has been writing about systemic racism on WeChat, the Chinese social-media app, for years. ",
            "The unrest following George Floyd’s killing has given these new outlets a new topic of huge interest to Chinese listeners: race in America. In part, the interest was fanned by Chinese state media, which tends to dramatize America’s domestic strife. As the protests grew in late spring and early summer, Chinese media portrayed a chaotic, hypocritical United States with vivid images of tumult and police violence. But these new outlets portrayed something different—a more balanced picture of race relations, a diagnosis of root causes that went beyond a two-tiered U.S. legal system and extended to global cultural and racial dynamics. ",
            "If their coverage of the George Floyd protests is a sign of what’s to come, these independent Chinese media outlets could play a crucial role in demystifying, or more fully explaining, U.S. politics and culture for a select Chinese audience. They might even set the tone for a clearer, more open cultural relationship between the two countries, even as foreign-policy tensions between them boil over.",
            "To Americans who have never seen their own country covered overseas, it can be shocking to see the way some Chinese media portray it.",
            "Take HBO’s removal of the movie “Gone with the Wind” as an example. After HBO briefly took down the film in early June because of its problematic portrayal of people of color, Chinese media—official and unofficial—blew the story up into such a hot-button national controversy that many in China think the United States is having its own Cultural Revolution, all triggered by one movie. (In reality, the network put it back online in a week.) One headline read “American Cultural Revolution: Ridiculous and Unfortunate, Gone with the Wind Got Pulled.” Another used a militant phrase popular during the Cultural Revolution, qingsuan, meaning eradicating crimes, to describe the removal of the Civil War drama.",
            "To address this kind of inaccurate coverage of U.S. social dynamics, the newer independent media platforms have built their influence over the past few years among open-minded, liberal Chinese people home and abroad. Quite a few were already influencers on Chinese social media—Weibo and WeChat—before starting their own media products. ",
            "The creators are academics, journalists, lawyers and activists trained in Western universities, attracted to liberal democratic ideals, and critical of both China’s party state and Western exceptionalism. On the American political spectrum, they’d be considered progressive. And they offer a perspective—critical of both the U.S. and China—that’s rarely seen in the mainland discourse.",
            "“What they do is very important because progressive values barely had any space on the Chinese internet before,” says Fang, a journalism professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong who studies Chinese media. In his view, their role isn’t to shift broader Chinese public attitudes, but “to cater to a highly educated crowd who already hold similar political values and then to influence a minority of others who are open-minded and willing to be challenged.” They want to challenge the isolationist worldview from both China and the United States, and signal with their content as well as their distribution that globalization is here to stay.",
            "Today, this transnational treatment of the news means translating the Black Lives Matter movement for a group of people who may be curious about the movement’s aims in the U.S., and also willing to acknowledge that anti-Black racism is far from a uniquely American problem. ",
            "People in China following the story exclusively through state media may lack all that context. Analysts say it’s not uncommon for Chinese readers to regard the whole uprising with shock and disapproval; some make racist comments of their on social media and in comments sections of news stories online. “When social movements, such as Black Lives Matter, erupt, because of their oversimplified view of racism, they tend to misunderstand what the protesters want,” Yao Lin, an In-Betweenness cohost, says, “and some of them tend to stand with white supremacists and the status quo.”",
            "Many of these new independent media platforms offer a different way to see the protests in the United States. These new media outlets have explained to their audiences what racism in the United States is, and why the Chinese should pay attention to anti-Black racism. And they have also done what would be unthinkable for institutional Chinese media: They have turned a critical lens back on China itself, pointing to the rising racism against Africans in Guangzhou during the Covid-19 outbreak, when many were evicted from their apartments from landlords or turned away from hotels. “Racial discrimination can be relevant even to those in China because they can draw a parallel between systematic racism and discriminations against women, sexual minorities and migrant workers, which are more common in China,” says Zhicheng Zhao, founder of New York Culture Salon. ",
            "Loud Murmurs, a Mandarin podcast focused on American pop culture, is planning a three-episode series in light of the Black Lives Matter movement unfolding in the United States, where the show’s hosts live. For their upcoming episode, they invited two Black men, one of whom is an African immigrant who’s been educated in the West and in China, the other an African American who works in China, to discuss how Hollywood portrays Blackness, how those portrayals are received in China and their personal experience with racism in China.",
            "To address the misunderstanding that the United States is having its own Cultural Revolution, for instance, Loud Murmurs had their two Black guests talk about political correctness and how classic American movies portrayed slavery through rose-tinted glasses. “We understand that conversation. We are plugged in to it,” says Isabelle Niu, a co-host of Loud Murmurs. “And so we can offer our own insight and analysis on how this should be interpreted.”",
            "Some of the new outlets are also focusing on these conversations to tackle popular conservative Chinese arguments on Black Lives Matter and claim space in an information environment filled with increasingly nationalistic voices, which is engineered by pervasive censorship, propaganda and misinformation. ",
            "Yan Wang, the WeChat blogger, appeals to his audience by recounting his experience of confronting and overcoming his own racism over the years, alongside his analysis of racial segregation. The San Francisco-based software engineer has been active in debating online with older, more conservative Chinese immigrants about stereotypes they commonly hold about Black people.",
            "Based on his experience so far, he doesn’t foresee swaying many people’s opinions. “I have been trying to communicate with conservatives, and it’s been largely an attempt in vain,” Wang says. “Because what I say makes most of them extremely uncomfortable, and they don’t always make rational arguments.”",
            "His goal, Wang says, is to educate those who are already interested in social justice and politics, who can, hopefully, in the future influence other Chinese Americans, who have a reputation for being less politically engaged than other minority groups in the United States.",
            "These media platforms aren’t just liberal enclaves providing reporting and analysis for their audiences; they have also been trying to have conversations with people in real life. New York Culture Salon, a nonprofit organization that holds weekly seminars and releases them in podcast or video form, wanted to respond to how the social unrest in the United States has divided generations of Chinese immigrants and social media chat groups in China. The nonprofit has organized a six-week panel series devoted to the Black Lives Matter movement. ",
            "They invited young Chinese scholars who study law, activism and immigration in the U.S. to participate in broadcast panel discussions. The speakers tackled topics that might be perceived as elementary by American intellectuals, such as the historical role of violence in pushing for progress, why Chinese people should support Black Lives Matter and how systemic racism is embedded in U.S. institutions. More than 3,000 people from in and outside of China attended the first two webinars.",
            "Such platforms often have a tenuous relationship with Chinese censors. They are not high-profile enough to be erased from the Chinese internet completely. But once their content has gained steam on Chinese social media, especially on what are deemed sensitive political issues, they draw the attention of government censors.",
            "Loud Murmurs and New York Culture Salon have both had their content, social media posts and platforms censored for touching domestic political topics, such as China’s controversial one-child-per-family policy. Their core audiences followed them as they moved their content to platforms untouched by Chinese censors, usually domains registered abroad. And for some of the podcasts in this new wave, talking about politics in foreign countries only—for instance, about the Black Lives Matter movement—shields them from censorship.",
            "“With pervasive censorship, we can only relieve political depression by focusing on the events unfolding across the Pacific,” says China-based Shiye Fu, a co-host of Stochastic Volatility, who has a degree in anthropology from Columbia University.",
            "None of the people I talked to for the story expect their content to attract a mainstream audience. But they hope the small audience they have connected with will connect with other Chinese speakers and go on to create something much larger than podcasts. ",
            "“We got a lot of comments like, ‘Wow. I’ve never heard four women talk about politics in a way that’s so uninhibited,” Niu says. “I think just the idea that you can express yourself without fear, even that is very encouraging to people.”"

            " The state's lawsuit is part of a growing pushback against the Trump administration's use of federal agents against protesters. ",
            "PORTLAND, Ore. — Attorneys for Oregon argued Wednesday for a restraining order against federal agents deployed to quell protests in Portland, in a standoff that some legal experts have warned could lead to a constitutional crisis in an election year.",
            "A federal judge heard the state's and the U.S. government's arguments in a lawsuit filed by Oregon Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum, who accuses federal agents of arresting protesters without probable cause, whisking them away in unmarked cars and using excessive force to quell the unrest. Federal authorities have disputed that.",
            "The lawsuit is part of a growing pushback against the Trump administration's use of federal agents in Portland and its plans to do the same in other cities that is deepening the country’s already considerable political divides. Democratic mayors of 15 cities — including Portland and cities where President Donald Trump has sent or threatened to send federal forces — condemned the use of the agents in a letter to the attorney general.",
            "The hearing Wednesday focused on the actions of more than 100 federal agents responding to protests outside the the city's Mark O. Hatfield Federal Courthouse, which has been a target for more than 50 nights of demonstrations against racial injustice following the killing of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police.",
            "The motion for a temporary restraining order asks U.S. District Court Judge Michael Mosman to command agents from the Department of Homeland Security, the U.S. Customs and Border Patrol, the Federal Protective Service and the U.S. Marshals Service to immediately stop detaining protesters without probable cause, to identify themselves and their agency before arresting anyone, and to explain why an arrest is taking place.",
            "During the hearing — held by videoconference because of the coronavirus pandemic — the state acknowledged during the hearing that the federal agents have the right to defend the courthouse, which is federal property, but argued they had overstepped that role.",
            "Rosenblum, the state attorney general, said she was asking the court to “declare it not acceptable for federal officers to use unconstitutional, police state-type acts to detain citizens of Oregon without cause.”",
            "David Morrell, an attorney for the U.S. government, called the motion “extraordinary” and told the court it was based solely on “a few threadbare declarations” from witnesses and a Twitter video.",
            "“It’s important to underscore what’s at stake here. The Hatfield courthouse did not damage itself,” he said, calling the protests “dangerous and volatile.”",
            "It's not clear when Mosman will rule, but he challenged the state on whether it had the proper standing to ask for the restraining order on behalf of all Oregonians. The judge noted that past legal decisions have required a state to establish a very high bar — “quasi-sovereign interest” — in order to successfully sue the U.S. government.",
            "Attorneys for Oregon contended they had met that bar because the actions of the federal agents could erode Oregonians' trust in all law enforcement, including state and city officers.",
            "But Morrell, the U.S. government attorney, disputed that, saying successful suits usually involved issues that affected many people, not “highly individual interests,” like the arrests.",
            "The suit is one of several filed over law enforcement's response to the Portland protests. On Thursday, a judge will hear arguments in a lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union on behalf of journalists and legal observers who say they were targeted and attacked by police while documenting demonstrations. A freelance photographer covering the protests for The Associated Press submitted an affidavit that he was beaten with batons, chemical irritants and hit with rubber bullets.",
            "U.S. Judge Michael Simon previously ruled that journalists and legal observers are exempt from Portland police orders requiring protesters to disperse once an area has been declared an unlawful assembly. Federal lawyers say in court filings that journalists should have to leave when ordered to do so.",
            "The Trump administration also faces another lawsuit, accusing federal agents of violating protesters’ 10th Amendment rights by engaging in police activities designated to local and state governments.",
            "Ahead of Wednesday’s hearing, a fence was raised around Portland's federal courthouse, at which protesters and federal agents had clashed again overnight, according to police. Protesters repeatedly tried to break into the courthouse and set fires around it, and the federal agents drove them back with tear gas and stun grenades, the police said.",
            "Far from tamping down the unrest in Portland, the presence of federal agents on the streets of the progressive city has recently energized the nightly protests. Crowds had numbered fewer than 100 people but swelled to more than 1,000 over the weekend as outrage over the use of federal forces appeared to unite Portlanders.",
            "More broadly, the use of federal agents against the wishes of state and local officials — and the threat that it might be done elsewhere — was deepening the country’s already considerable political divides and potentially setting up a constitutional crisis months ahead of the presidential election. The standoff could escalate if Trump sends federal agents elsewhere, as he says he plans to do, including to Chicago.",
            "The mayors of Chicago, Portland and 13 other Democrat-led cities called the deployment unconstitutional and alleged it was being done for political purposes in a letter to Attorney General William Barr and Department of Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf.",
            "“The president and his administration continually attack local leadership and amplify false and divisive rhetoric purely for campaign fodder,” the mayors wrote.",
            "Federal authorities, however, have defended their response, saying officials in Oregon had been unwilling to work with them to stop the vandalism against the the U.S. courthouse and violence against federal officers.",
            "Wolf told a news conference Tuesday in Washington that agents have been assaulted with lasers, bats, fireworks, bottles and other weapons. While he said federal agencies have made 43 arrests since July 4, he disputed that they were done by unidentified agents, noting that they have the word “police” on their uniforms.",
            "Among the protesters this week was Maureen Healy, who joined a march Monday with a family member, as demonstrators sang songs, chanted the names of Black lives lost and held moments of silence.",
            "Just after midnight, she saw a line of authorities wearing camouflage and dark outfits emerge and advance on the crowd. The crowd retreated, and Healy said she heard bangs, saw smoke and was struck by a projectile as she turned away. She went to the hospital with a black eye, cut to her face and a possible concussion.",
            "“This is my home. I was protesting peacefully so why did federal troops shoot me in the head?” asked Healy, 52, who is the chair of the History Department at Lewis & Clark College."

Over the last eight years, the movement has steadily built a modern infrastructure on top of decades-old social justice institutions like the Highlander Center. ",
            "The distributed setup has at times contributed to tensions. National Black activists have feuded over which policy programs put forward by different organizations best represent the goals of the movement. Some admitted the decentralized system can confuse the public at times and leave the movement open to misconceptions in the press. But none of the 10 activists POLITICO spoke to from across the country said they wanted a hierarchical structure instead, as the movement seeks to turn its newfound momentum into policy changes at the local and national levels. ",
            "“There were explicit decisions around building the movement in a way that would be both coordinated and decentralized,” said Maurice Mitchell, national director of the Working Families Party and an organizer with the Movement for Black Lives. “There's no way that you could have these many actions with the same demand if there wasn't a level of high level coordination.” ",
            "When George Floyd’s killing at the hands of a white Minneapolis police officer was captured on film, hundreds of organizations and thousands of activists were ready to launch protests in their cities. They pushed policy with local legislators and police departments and rallied people who hadn't previously engaged in BLM protests around the message of “defund the police.”",
            "The growing, multiracial movement has quickly shifted the conversation around policing and racism across the country, including in Washington, where lawmakers have been unsure how to react or liaise with the groundswell. There is no chairperson or candidate calling the shots in private or serving as a public rallying point. With no singular person to attack in tweets, President Donald Trump instead directed his ire and threats of violence at mostly peaceful protesters. ",
            "“In terms of strategy — and this is very real that we have to be honest about this — it makes it harder for those who are against us to do what they did in the ‘60s, which is to target one leader,” said Cliff Albright, co-founder of Black Voters Matter Fund, a voter engagement nonprofit.",
            "That doesn’t make them leaderless, activists say. Instead, they call themselves “leaderful.” Even at the beginning of the movement, the power structure was based in collaboration. The Black Lives Matter Global Network was co-founded in 2013 by three female organizers, and the Movement for Black Lives, formed one year later, has no governing board, though it coordinates with more than 150 organizations.",
            "\"We don't need someone in the Senate or House to try to build their political career off of this moment,\" said Bryan Mercer, executive director of the Philadelphia-based social justice organization Movement Alliance Project. \"It is a misconception that we need a charismatic leader to carry this work forward.\"",
            "Activists in cities all over the country are trading notes through the network as they pressure local officials to explore new public safety options, from doing away with police in schools to slashing budgets or reimagining police departments entirely. ",
            "The Minneapolis city council’s pledge to break up its police department and start from scratch “doesn't just have implications for Minneapolis,” said Mitchell. “That has national implications.”",
            "Angela Lang, executive director of Black Leaders Organizing for Communities in Milwaukee, said she is having more conversations with other Black organizers across the country than ever before. The Milwaukee Fire and Police Commission is in turmoil — with an executive director on the way out and a chairman facing accusations of ethics violations — as protesters demand change. Lang’s organization put together 300 responses for the commission on what residents want to see from the next executive director, and it is pressuring the local police department as its chief wraps his six-month evaluation.",
            "Meanwhile, other portions of the movement are organizing bigger national actions. Woodard Henderson, along with the SEIU, the Fight for $15 advocacy group and other unions, orchestrated a strike for Black lives on Monday, with thousands of workers in more than 25 cities walking off the job.",
            "Jessica Byrd, a strategist with Three Point Strategies and leader in the Movement for Black Lives, wakes up at 4 a.m. most days to prepare for the online Black National Convention on Aug. 28, which aims to engage 4 million Black people across the country. Ahead of the convention, roughly 1,000 Black activists will meet virtually to craft a 100-day agenda for a potential Joe Biden administration, which will be unveiled at the national gathering. ",
            "“We have a new election cycle in which we are a central force, whereas in 2016, there were headlines saying that Black movement didn't care about elections,” said Byrd, who oversees the Electoral Justice Project for the Movement for Black Lives, which launched in 2017. ",
            "Federal lawmakers have already responded to the dramatic shift in public attitudes toward Black Lives Matter, with the Democratic-led House passing a sweeping police reform bill at the end of June. Though multiple senior lawmakers have rejected the \"defund the police\" push, activists see the bill as just a starting point. They countered with their own piece of legislation: the Breathe Act, which seeks to eliminate federal agencies and programs that invest in and expand law enforcement.",
            "“We wanted to be clear that we could speak for ourselves,” said Woodard Henderson. “That we could actually write our own federal legislation that is incorporating the policy demands that we've been raising.” ",
            "The bill has yet to formally be introduced by a lawmaker in Congress, but first-term Reps. Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.) and Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) participated in its rollout with the Movement for Black Lives. Pressley, members of the Congressional Black Caucus and activists with the Movement for Black Lives are in ongoing conversations about the proposal.",
            "“I am thankful for M4BL’s leadership and stand ready to work alongside them to fight for structural change, legislate accountability, and move in the direction of justice and healing,” Pressley said in a statement to POLITICO. ",
            "But other national policy pushes growing out of the movement have inspired dissension within it. ",
            "One of the most widely known policy plans to come out of the Black Lives Matter movement is the “8 Can’t Wait” proposals from the racial justice group Campaign Zero. The package is composed of “restrictive use of force policies” for local police departments — including banning chokeholds, mandating de-escalation and warning before shooting — which the group argued would decrease killings.",
            "Deray Mckesson, co-founder of Campaign Zero, said the platform was meant to “normalize” police reform policies. “If the police are going to exist tomorrow, they should have dramatically less power tomorrow,” he told GQ. But the release of “8 Can’t Wait” in early June was met with swift criticism from a number of activists who felt the proposals did not go far enough in a climate where calls to “defund the police” were gaining wider acceptance. Within a week, Campaign Zero co-founder Brittany Packnett Cunningham announced her departure from the organization in response to the backlash. Campaign Zero issued an apology on its website, saying its campaign “unintentionally detracted from efforts of fellow organizers invested in paradigmatic shifts that are newly possible in this moment.” ",
            "Jennifer Epps-Addison, co-executive director of the Center for Popular Democracy, said the main contention with the policies is that many of them are already mandated in police departments, demonstrating to her that a more thorough transformation of public safety is needed.",
            "\"I was a part of the criminalization apparatus and system myself,\" said Epps-Addison, a former public defender. \"We cannot continue to invest in structures that ultimately need to be dismantled in order for Black people to have freedom.\" ",
            "As the movement grew after the killings of Trayvon Martin and Michael Brown, federal and philanthropic dollars “poured into reforms, a level of investment we hadn't seen probably since the 1994 crime bill,\" Epps-Addison continued. \"And those reforms don't work.” ",
            "The “8 Can’t Wait” package has also faced opposition from the other direction, though: In Atlanta, the city council passed the package after the killing of Rayshard Brooks by police in a Wendy’s parking lot. But Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms — a Democratic vice presidential contender — vetoed the package, to the frustration of local activists. ",
            "“If we can't get that passed in a place like Atlanta, we have a lot of work to get done,” said Nse Ufot, executive director of the New Georgia Project, which mobilizes young voters of color. \"I don't think that [officials] are moving at the pace of change that movement is, and there will be a reckoning.\""

            "The confrontations in Portland are generating national scrutiny as the state's governor and Portland's mayor have asked the federal agents to leave — and been denied. \"What they are doing is sharply escalating the situation,\" Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler said Sunday on CNN's \"State of the Union. \"Their presence here is actually leading to more violence and more vandalism. And it's not helping the situation at all. They're not wanted here.\"",
            "President Donald Trump on Sunday emphasized he had authorized the federal action in Portland and would likely expand it to other cities he has deemed insufficiently responsive to civil unrest aimed at federal monuments and buildings.",

            "In their letter, the Democrats trace allegations of an improper federal crackdown to late May, following the death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police officers who now stand charged with his murder. On June 1, federal agents stormed Lafayette Square, where a peaceful protest was being staged for police reform, deploying pepper balls and flash bangs and forcibly pushing protesters away from the park, shortly before Trump strode to the nearby St. John's Church for a photo op holding a bible. The federal response included some security officers who weren't wearing identifiers, raising alarms about a potential lack of accountability.",

        "title": "'It's not enough': Activists say Black Lives Matter murals are empty gesture",
        "body": [
            "In place of words painted on the street, organizers are calling for immediate policy changes.",
            "Since George Floyd was killed by a Minneapolis police officer in late May, Black Lives Matter activists have taken to the streets demanding radical changes to police departments and other parts of government. So far, the political class is offering little more than words painted on streets.",
            "That, at least, is the emerging sentiment toward the Black Lives Matters street murals popping up in cities around the country. These efforts, meant to represent a commitment to social justice in local communities, have received praise from community members and some public figures. But they’ve also garnered criticism from activists who are pushing their mayors and governors to move past symbolism and institute immediate policy changes.",
            "Rather than ordering the words painted on streets, activists argue, lawmakers should take action to protect Black lives in real time — by enacting the policies that Black organizers have been calling for since before the Floyd protests began. So far, few of those in power are getting the message.",
            "“It's not enough. What we're asking for is not, like, a symbolic recognition of how Black lives matter,” said Delilah Pierre, an organizer with the Tallahassee Community Action Committee. The Florida state capital is one of the latest cities to paint the now-familiar yellow-and-black mural across a major intersection. “We're asking for that to be something that's in practice. We're asking for real systemic change to the system that oppresses and marginalizes Black people.”",
            "The Black Lives Matter street art, meanwhile, originated more as a way to troll President Donald Trump, who has called Black Lives Matter a “hate group.” ",
            "Washington, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser commissioned the first BLM mural in early June, in response to Trump’s militarization of the city’s downtown and use of chemicals to clear protesters in front of the White House. She renamed the intersection across from the White House Black Lives Matter plaza and had the words painted across the asphalt in bold yellow lettering.",
            "More than a dozen other cities have since adopted the practice. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio was one of the first to follow suit, ordering Black Lives Matter to be painted on Fifth Avenue, directly across from Trump Tower. The Rev. Al Sharpton and members of the Central Park Five participated in its unveiling.",
            "Still, activists say that in most places, political leaders have not matched those expressions of support with the kinds of policy changes that would tangibly improve people’s lives. As coronavirus cases continue to spike, Black and Latino patients comprise the majority of cases and deaths. Since Floyd’s killing in late May, more African Americans have been killed by police officers, only further injecting energy into the protest movement against police violence. ",
            "State and national legislative leaders, meanwhile, have not responded with the kind of urgency the colliding crises demand. Congress has not passed a relief package since May while more than 30 million Americans could be without any income if unemployment relief is not renewed by the end of July. A rent crisis remains on the horizon as more than one-third of Americans missed rent and mortgage payments at the beginning of the month. Black and Latino populations stand to bear the brunt of these calamities, as unemployment remains disproportionately high in both communities. ",
            "Those realities prompted D.C. activists to immediately paint a counter-message on the street next to Mayor Bowser’s Black Lives Matter mural: “Defund the police.” Black Lives Matter D.C. has also since released a statement condemning the mural and calling it “performative.”",
            "“The folks who painted that ... they know very well that that wasn't a genuine thing by Muriel Bowser,” said Sean Blackmon, an organizer with the D.C.-based Stop Police Terror Project, which organizes nationwide against police violence. “And so what that really says is, ‘if you think that Black Lives Matter, Muriel Bowser, then you must defund the police.’”",
            "“They paint the letters of your movement on a street and are hailed across the country but they're not willing to look you in the eye and talk about solutions,” said Jessica Byrd, co-founder of Three Point Strategies and an organizer with the Movement for Black Lives. “I mean, it takes an incredible amount of cognitive dissonance to believe that a mural is enough and that it could replace a conversation about structural change in the city.”",
            "In some municipalities, leaders have answered the protesters' calls for change. Minneapolis, the catalyst for the wave of anti-racism protests happening around the world, advanced a ballot measure that would disband the city’s police department and establish a new security and violence prevention force. So far, it is the only city to pass legislation disbanding police since Floyd’s death.",
            "But with pressure rising from local organizers and the national outcry, a growing number of state and local leaders have announced plans to decrease police budgets for the upcoming fiscal year and redirect the funds to communities of color. Los Angeles’ city council cut $150 million from its police budget. San Francisco has enacted similar measures, pledging to cut from the city’s police budget and reallocate the funds to programs benefiting the local Black community. ",
            "Defenders of the murals say that art still has a special place in social movements, and the murals are not intended to be a substitute for policy changes. Some protesters have, themselves, erected Black Lives Matter art of their own. It’s a different dynamic, however, Pierre explained, because there is a unique understanding behind the work.",
            "“I think when activists go out, and they create those symbols, and they've been doing the work of really trying to uplift Black people in their communities, it's way different. Because they're coming from the perspective of love. And it's kind of a sign of what's to come,” she said. “We can't stop at paintings. We have to really change the system, especially the way that Black people and the police interact.”"

            "The Trump administration is resisting calls — even from political allies — to withdraw a proposal to make it more difficult to bring discrimination claims under the Fair Housing Act, even as the nation reckons with racial unrest, according to a letter obtained by POLITICO.",
            "Deputy Housing and Urban Development Secretary Brian Montgomery reaffirmed HUD’s plans to issue a final rule later this year in a letter Tuesday to Bank of America Vice Chairman Anne Finucane, who had urged HUD to drop the effort in a letter last month, citing “recent protests and events.”",
            "Montgomery responded that HUD has “never ceased working to achieve more equitable results and to correct for past errors, regardless of who is setting policy.”",
            "“Contrary to your assertion, the leadership and professional staff at HUD is working on a daily basis to live up to the spirit of the Fair Housing Act,” he added.",
            "HUD released a proposal in August to significantly revise a 2013 agency rule by requiring plaintiffs to clear a higher bar to prove unintentional discrimination and giving defendants more leeway to rebut a claim.",
            "The proposed revision to the 2013 rule is one of several efforts by the Trump administration to roll back the Obama administration’s use of so-called disparate impact — the legal theory that holds business and governments accountable for practices that disproportionately affect minorities even if no discrimination was intended — to root out discrimination.",
            "Democrats and fair housing advocates lambasted the administration when the proposal was released. Now, as companies and organizations across the country rush to publicly show their dedication to racial equality in the aftermath of protests over George Floyd’s death at the hands of police, the calls to withdraw the contentious proposal are coming from closer to home.",
            "The powerful National Association of Realtors — second only to the Chamber of Commerce in its lobbying expenditures — urged HUD to retract the proposed rule in a letter Monday, pointing to a “broad consensus across the country that now is not the time to issue a regulation that could hinder further progress on addressing ongoing systemic racism in our country.”",
            "HUD has maintained — and reiterated Tuesday — that the proposal merely brings the agency’s interpretation of the disparate impact standard in line with a 2015 Supreme Court ruling.",
            "“Although the Supreme Court decision did not address HUD’s rules directly, the Court went out of its way to urge caution in applying disparate impact theory in a manner that might undermine the very mission of both fair housing and helping to develop communities that suffer from lack of investment,” Montgomery wrote Tuesday.",
            "The high court held that disparate impact claims can be brought under the Fair Housing Act but said “disparate impact liability must be limited so employers and other regulated entities are able to make the practical business choices and profit-related decisions that sustain a vibrant and dynamic free-enterprise system.”",
            "Montgomery also took a shot at Bank of America for withdrawing from the Federal Housing Administration loan program, as many banks have done since the Obama administration aggressively used the False Claims Act to secure hefty penalties from financial institutions after the 2008 financial crisis.",
            "Montgomery, who has publicly fretted about banks’ pullback from the FHA channel, said in his letter that HUD and FHA have “had very productive discussions with all of the major banks, with one notable exception: Bank of America.",
            "“I applaud Bank of America’s recent $1 billion commitment to aid communities dealing with economic and racial inequities exacerbated by the coronavirus outbreak,” Montgomery wrote. “However, Bank of America’s participation in the FHA program — which reaches double the percentage of minorities compared with the programs offered by your bank — would likely eclipse this amount.”"

            "Mayors Keisha Lance Bottoms, Muriel Bowser, Lori Lightfoot and London Breed steer four of America’s most prominent cities at a time when activists are looking to their local leaders to transform American policing. The four women have emerged as leading national voices, regularly appearing on cable news and headlining virtual forums on policing and protests. ",
            "But this elevated platform comes with a weighty set of expectations among constituencies with very different views of public safety and has led to rising frustration among members of the Black communities that helped elect them in the first place.",
            "“There’s always added pressure on Black mayors dealing with public safety issues,” said Michael Nutter, the former mayor of Philadelphia. “Because you’re caught in the middle — Black communities want to be safe but they don’t want to be abused. As a Black mayor, you have to be able to deliver both of those messages, which at times might be at odds with each other.”",
            "While the mayors represent a range of constituencies, they have in common a pro-reform approach to policing that has done little to satiate the demands for change. All have repeatedly expressed support for protesters' efforts, but none have made sweeping changes in their city police departments — even as the calls for them to do so grow louder.",
            "“The challenge of being both Black and being a woman ... I think all of that plays into perhaps the cautious nature with which you see these mayors engaging their activist communities,” said Ravi Perry, dean of the political science department at Howard University. “Inherently, these elected officials are ... representing a system that many of the left in the community believe should be dismantled.” ",
            "That conflict is now playing out under a magnifying glass: Atlanta’s Lance Bottoms, who announced Tuesday that she tested positive for Covid-19, is one of a handful of women atop Joe Biden’s vice presidential shortlist. ",

San Francisco’s Breed was also the first Black woman elected to lead her city. All are Democrats.",
            "Yet, as the mayors' political profiles have risen, their agendas have also been overtaken by multiple crises. The novel coronavirus, which causes Covid-19, is disproportionately infecting and killing Black Americans in Atlanta, Chicago and D.C. and other cities across the United States (in San Francisco, Black residents are being infected at a roughly proportional rate, but are dying at a higher one). Meanwhile, Demonstrations over police brutality and racism have taken over their streets. ",
            "And in the wake of an alarmingly bloody Fourth of July weekend in several major cities, including theirs, the debate over public safety has taken on renewed significance.",

Chicago saw 15 deaths from 49 incidents, while an 11-year-old was killed in the nation’s capital and a 6-year-old in San Francisco over the July 4 holiday weekend. Atlanta, Chicago and D.C., whose populations are more than 30 percent Black, have also been home to some of the nation’s largest protest demonstrations. ",

After the shooting death of 8-year-old Secoriea Turner over the weekend, Bottoms took a swipe at those perpetuating the violence, with an allusion to the Black Lives Matter movement, at large.",
            "“We have talked about this movement that’s happening across America in this moment in time where we have the ears and interests of people across this country and across this globe,” Lance Bottoms said at a Monday news conference. ",
            "“But the difference in this moment in time and the civil rights movement, the civil rights movement — it was a defined common enemy. So we’re fighting the enemy within when we are shooting each other up on our streets and the city.” ",
            "Bottoms’ strong words reveal how the dynamic between mayors and activists extends beyond the common push-and-pull of policymaking to a shared racial identity. Lightfoot has taken a similar approach, both by frequently acknowledging the virus’ disproportionate impact on Black Chicagoans and characterizing herself on Twitter as an omnipresent Auntie to some youth who were reluctant to stay home or social distance. Neither Bottoms nor Lighftoot responded to requests for comment.",
            "Still, amid a nationwide reckoning on race and racism, organizers say that the time for talking is over. ",
            "“For so long in this country, we've tinkered around the edges of structural change,” Byrd said. “And we've said to law enforcement: 'If you could just kill us less, if you could just learn a new trick so that maybe you won't kill us in this specific way, then that'll feel like progress.” ",
            "Yet, this crisis, Byrd and other organizers argue, requires immediate action from leaders and particularly their Black mayors beyond change within police forces. Many have been asking for this change since long before Floyd’s killing.",
            "April Goggans, a lead organizer with Black Lives Matter D.C., described the group’s relationship with Bowser as “contentious.”",
            "“She has done everything to discredit, disrespect or ignore us until George Floyd was murdered,” Goggans said. “[She’s] really portraying herself and D.C. as so progressive when it comes to policing and police brutality when she hasn't even said the names of the people who have been killed in D.C. by police.” ",
            "When Bowser ordered “Black Lives Matter” painted on the street leading to the White House and renamed the area in front of the White House “Black Lives Matter” plaza, the move was seen by national commentators as a powerful affront to President Donald Trump’s law-and-order leadership style and an olive branch to the city’s activist community. ",
            "Activists, however, saw it as an empty gesture. The same weekend, Black Lives Matter D.C. painted “Defund the Police” in the same large, yellow letters across from the first phrase, a response they said was meant to confront Bowser’s lip service to the issue of police violence and call attention to their demands. Bowser did not respond to requests to comment.",
            "Lightfoot and Chicago activists also have conflicting views on police reform. Lightfoot told POLITICO last month that calls to defund the city’s police department make for a “nice hashtag”, but said it would hurt efforts to diversify the force and run counter to what most Chicagoans want. Organizers say her record on police reform is too weak to prove that her current efforts would yield real change.",
            "“We're not going to keep saying ‘let’s train the police’ when that hasn't occurred,” said Inez White, an organizer with the Chicago chapter of BYP100, a national organization of young Black activists. “Training police has cost us more money, and has still led to black people being killed.” ",
            "The pressure on the mayors to deliver policy results has been compounded by partisan gridlock at both the federal and state levels. Congress and many state legislatures have yet to agree on any significant policy changes related to policing, and an overwhelming majority of national legislators are against defunding the police.",
            "“What adds to the problem is not having federal or national standards and having each mayor who has to pretty much do his own thing,” said McKinley Price, mayor of Newport News, Va., and president of the African-American Mayors’ Association. “I think it is putting pressure on mayors and pressures on our police chiefs and doggedly for them to try and come up with a plan that's going to be unique and good for them.”",
            "Activists say they plan to continue to mobilize against their mayors’ incremental reform models throughout the summer and beyond. They also maintain that leaders still have an opportunity to save face: by increasing transparency in their cities’ budgeting processes, reallocating funds to other municipal services like housing and, perhaps most contentiously, finding alternatives to the police. ",
            "“In these jobs there’s so many balancing components,” Nutter explained. “You can't have a great city of people who don't feel safe. Those mayors know that.”",
            "CORRECTION: This story has been corrected to reflect the fact that Mayor Breed has proposed to redirect funds from the San Francisco Police Department to Black communities and clarifies that Black San Franciscans are being infected at a rate roughly proportional to their population."

        "title": "Inside the Ad Boycott That Has Facebook on the Defensive",
        "body": [
            "Hundreds of companies are boycotting the social media giant. Here’s the backstory of how it happened.",
            "The advertising boycott battering Facebook is unlike anything the social-media giant has faced in its 16-year history: Three days in, 800 companies worldwide have pulled millions of dollars in advertising from the social network, with brands from Coca-Cola to Ford to global conglomerate Unilever demanding that Facebook monitor hate speech more aggressively.",
            "With pullouts mounting and the company’s name constantly tied to racism and hate in the news coverage, CEO Mark Zuckerberg responded by livestreaming part of an employee meeting — one of the few times he’s done that in the company’s history. Then, on Wednesday, Facebook’s powerhouse policy and communications chief, former British Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, issued an open letter, titled “Facebook does not benefit from hate,” touting its efforts to police its content.",
            "The boycott has emerged as a crucial test for a company that has become a key player in American politics simply because of what it hosts and promotes on its site, and which until recently had been vocally doubling down on its commitment to keeping an open platform for users’ speech. ",
            "It is also a behind-the-scenes triumph for a novel coalition of civil rights groups and other advocacy organizations — the architects of the #StopHateForProfit campaign that many of the boycotting companies have signed on to. ",
            "Interviews with leaders of the nine coalition partners reveal how the groups spun up a boycott idea in a matter of days, responding to the George Floyd protests late this spring and using public energy to join together several long-simmering, frustrated efforts to hold Facebook to account for its content. They lobbied corporate leaders in private and, in some cases, shamed companies on social media to join the effort.",
            "“[Facebook] is a breeding ground for racial hate groups,” says Derrick Johnson, president of the NAACP, one of the groups that made up the coalition. Referring to Zuckerberg, he said, “You can’t reason with the guy.”",
            "In short order, the coalition has emerged as perhaps Facebook’s most formidable antagonist, when little else — not Congress, not European regulators, not public declarations by celebrities that they were deleting their Facebook accounts — has had much effect on how the site operates. And their campaign might offer a blueprint for how activist groups can tackle a modern tech giant: fusing novel pressure tactics with the weight of legacy civil rights groups. ",
            "It remains to be seen whether Facebook will really be dented, either financially or as a brand. The company declined to comment for this article except to point to a statement issued in response to the boycott, saying Facebook “invest[s] billions of dollars each year to keep our community safe and continuously work[s] with outside experts to review and update our policies,” and that it is taking steps to address hate. The statement added, “we know we have more work to do.” So far, the company hasn’t made major concessions, though. And while its stock price has dipped sharply, Zuckerberg — who has long defended the platform as a space for free expression — reportedly has said advertisers would be back “soon enough.” Analysts likewise say Facebook can weather the storm; most of its ads come from small and medium-size buyers, not the large corporations making boycott headlines, and Bloomberg researchers predicted Monday that the boycotts could cost Facebook only $250 million in ad sales — a sliver of the company’s $77 billion in annual revenue.",
            "But a look at the origins and dynamics of StopHateForProfit suggests the campaign has at least one insight that people often forget when it comes to a tech behemoth with the Silicon Valley sheen of Facebook: At the end of the day, the social network is just an advertising vehicle, with 98 percent of its revenue coming from ads. And like old-line pressure campaigns against TV networks or newspapers, if you can get to the advertisers, the company has to pay attention.",
            "While the boycott came together quickly, its roots trace back to the 2016 election. Amid widespread outrage over the role Facebook had played, one complaint was that Russians were using the site to exploit America’s racial tensions. But the site wasn’t just amplifying them, activists came to believe. It was a petri dish for racism and discrimination; it was growing hate. And, by taking a largely hands-off approach, Facebook wasn’t taking the issue seriously, the activists decided. ",
            "In the months after Donald Trump was sworn in as president, civil rights groups and other social justice organizations began quietly comparing notes about their interactions with Facebook and Silicon Valley more broadly.",
            "“The conversations started really informally, just collecting information. But what we learned was that we were getting played by Facebook and other big tech companies,” says Jessica González, co-CEO of the left-leaning media advocacy organization Free Press. “They had a very strategic appeasement strategy, where they gave us breadcrumbs, but in a way that made it look like they were doing such great work when in fact hate and disinformation were rampant on their site.”",
            "The advocates tried to figure out how to get Facebook and other tech companies to take their complaints more seriously. Campaigns to get users to stay away from the platform, or to allow civil rights groups to alert the companies of hateful activities, largely sputtered. In 2018, Facebook announced it would undergo an audit to better understand how it was affecting communities of color and other marginalized groups, led by Laura Murphy, a highly regarded civil rights advocate. But a pivotal five-week stretch this past fall largely erased whatever goodwill was left.",
            "On a Tuesday afternoon in late September, Clegg, Facebook’s head of policy and communications, announced the company was exempting politicians’ ads from its fact-checking process, arguing that the public should be able to see, and vet, what political leaders say. Clegg told me in an interview at the time that it was long-standing policy but that, “The purpose of it, I hope, was pretty clear, which was: This is what we’re doing ahead of 2020. These are our plans.”",
            "Facebook’s critics took umbrage at both what Clegg said — revealing, they thought, that Facebook failed to grasp the history of American politicians stoking racial divisions — and when he said it. Color of Change, which was founded in the wake of Hurricane Katrina to organize African Americans online, and other groups had been working for months to pull together an event, called “Civil Rights x Tech,” with Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg; it was scheduled for just two days after Clegg’s speech. At the summit, against a backdrop of soaring brick walls and exposed piping in an events space in Atlanta’s West Midtown, Sandberg and Neil Potts, a Facebook public policy director, were pressed on what Clegg had said and reassured the advocates, González told me.",
            "Two weeks later, Facebook announced that Zuckerberg would deliver a speech at Georgetown University laying out his thinking on “free expression.” He and Clegg previewed the speech with some of the civil rights leaders. Zuckerberg would be doubling down on the politicians’ exemption, while daring to draw a connection between Facebook and the importance of free speech in U.S. civil rights history, from Frederick Douglass to Martin Luther King Jr.",
            "“I warned him of the perils of doing that,” says Vanita Gupta, president and CEO of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights. ",
            "Zuckerberg did it anyway, in a dramatic 37-minute speech on Oct. 17 from Georgetown’s Gaston Hall. Afterward, the advocates concluded that the CEO believed, deep in his bones, that his commitment to free expression — even if it aligned him with the most virulent strains of American society — was right, regardless of what Sandberg had said in Atlanta. “[Sandberg] seems sincere. She’s certainly good at her job. But the fact of the matter is, at the end of the day, the buck stops with Zuckerberg and the board of directors,” González told me.",
            "After the speech sparked a firestorm, Zuckerberg convened a dinner with civil rights leaders at his home in Palo Alto, Calif., in early November. “The last time I was in a room with all of those leaders, the other person at the table was Barack Obama,” Rashad Robinson, executive director of Color of Change, told me last fall. It was a pleasant enough discussion, but he said it solidified for him that civil rights weren’t a priority at Facebook’s highest levels. ",
            "For Gupta, the fall of 2019 led her to believe Facebook had embraced a moral equivalence between civil rights groups and far-right conservatives, as two constituencies the company simply needed to placate — an approach she says she saw as part of a “structural deficiency” Facebook was unwilling to address.",
            "The advocates went into the winter more worried than ever, and trying to figure out what to do next.",
            "In late May, after the death of George Floyd at the hands of police in Minneapolis triggered a revival in the Black Lives Matter movement, then protests, then widespread public outrage, civil rights advocates found themselves on a conference call with Zuckerberg that would turn out to be a key moment in developing the boycott plan. ",
            "It started on May 29, when Trump posted — on Twitter and Facebook — a note about a possible federal response to protests in Minnesota: “Any difficulty and we will assume control, but when the looting starts, the shooting starts.” Trump would later say he was simply warning that looting can lead to violence, though many saw the tweet as a dog whistle.",
            "Twitter, which already had begun taking a harder line on Trump’s tweets, attached a warning label to the post stating it violated the site’s rules against “glorifying violence,” but that “Twitter has determined that it may be in the public’s interest for the Tweet to remain accessible.” Zuckerberg, meanwhile, ruled that Trump’s post hadn’t violated his site’s policies on violence speech, and said that if it had, Facebook would have taken it down. “Unlike Twitter, we do not have a policy of putting a warning in front of posts that may incite violence because we believe that if a post incites violence, it should be removed regardless of whether it is newsworthy, even if it comes from a politician,” Zuckerberg wrote on Facebook.",
            "The swipe at Twitter, which, in the eyes of advocates, had taken the post more seriously, irked them. “When Mark Zuckerberg criticized Jack Dorsey for that, we realized we had even more of a serious problem than we thought,” Johnson, the NAACP president, told me. Reports that Zuckerberg had talked over his decision with Trump himself didn’t help. ",
            "On Monday, June 1, came the conference call. It was a prescheduled conversation, in which Zuckerberg planned to talk with civil rights leaders about Facebook’s preparation for the 2020 election, but the topic of Trump’s posts came up too. Trump also had floated theories about how Democrats were trying to “rig” the 2020 election by promoting the use of mail-in ballots during the coronavirus pandemic. Facebook had said in a statement that it didn’t touch Trump’s post because, when it came in elections, it believed in “robust debate.” ",
            "“I’m seeing Mark’s face as he’s trying to explain to Sherrilyn Ifill” — president of the NAACP’s Legal Defense and Educational Fund — “why something isn’t voter suppression. He’s trying to talk down one of the most important voting rights litigators in the country,” Robinson told me. Gupta says she went into the call eager to hear Zuckerberg’s rationale for dealing with the posts. But she told me, “I was completely dissatisfied with it. It was completely confounding and did not make sense.”",
            "For Robinson, it was a turning point. “What are we doing here? I don’t understand why I keep coming to these meetings with you all,” he remembers saying on the call. “I said to [Zuckerberg], and Sheryl, and Nick Clegg, and [global policy director] Joel Kaplan, ‘I feel like we have to do some other pivot.’ I’m saying to them that I’m going to have to go another route.” Gupta was similarly frustrated, yet she determined that the advocates couldn’t just “throw up our hands and walk away and just say, ‘Screw it.’”",
            "At those same moments, another set of advocacy groups was beginning to have conversations about where to go next. Among them was Sleeping Giants, a loose, semi-anonymous online collective that calls itself “a campaign to make bigotry and sexism less profitable.” The group had developed a reputation for taking down powerful targets with a fairly simple tactic: show their advertisers exactly what their ad dollars are supporting and quickly gin up, using social media, public pressure to get them to stop. Starting in 2016, the group had waged successful campaigns against Breitbart News and Bill O’Reilly.",
            "Now, as company after company put out its own statement supporting Black Lives Matter amid protests across the country, an opening for a similar strategy emerged with Facebook. If corporations were really serious about fighting racism, then why not back away from advertising on Facebook for hosting racist speech?",
            "Jim Steyer, who heads Common Sense Media, a group focused on improving the media landscape for families and children, knew Matt Rivitz, one of the two leaders of Sleeping Giants, and they had a conversation with Jonathan Greenblatt, CEO of the Anti-Defamation League. Along with Common Sense, the ADL began spreading word through progressive political circles that their small coalition was thinking of pushing for a one-month ad boycott of Facebook. ",
            "At the same time, Robinson and Color of Change were contemplating something similar and, after hearing about the ADL-tied effort, decided to join forces. Mozilla — the somewhat strange hybrid of tech company and online advocacy organization, which had long criticized Facebook’s handling of its users’ data and privacy — had worked with Common Sense in the past, and got pulled in. Others did too: the NAACP, the media advocacy group Free Press and, later, the League of United Latin American Citizens and the National Hispanic Media Coalition. Brenda Victoria Castillo, president of the NHMC, told me her group joined the coalition to make sure Latinx voices were represented — to leverage their strength: “We have $1.7 trillion buying power, and advertisers listen to those statistics.” (The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, led by Gupta, has not joined the boycott call. A spokesperson for the group said no one was available to discuss why.)",
            "“We felt like, ‘What else do we have to lose here?’” the NAACP’s Johnson says. “We’ve been speaking out and meeting with the company to no avail. We thought, ‘We need to do something.’”",
            "Not long after Zuckerberg’s conference call, the campaign had a name: #StopHateForProfit. “It was so quick, it was crazy,” Rivitz says. “It was an idea and then it was, ‘Hold on, we’ve got to talk to other people.’ And then it was, ‘Let’s go.’” They settled on a one-month boycott, a limit they hoped would force corporations to act fast. Plus, even if ad budgets were expected to be down in July anyway, with the country still suffering through the coronavirus and its economic fallout, the tight timeline meant companies could handle whatever lost revenue might come from ditching what is a widely popular means of digital marketing for them.",
            "Just before it launched, the campaign got a prominent boost. At an online event on June 16, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a strong Facebook critic, said, “Advertisers have tremendous leverage” over the company, and “I would say to them, know your power.” The next day, StopHateForProfit trumpeted the same message in an ad in the Los Angeles Times. (While he wouldn’t tell me if it was a coincidence, Jim Steyer pointed out that he and his brother — billionaire and former presidential candidate Tom Steyer — are close with Pelosi and her staff, and called the speaker’s message “very timely.”)",
            "The campaign officially began on June 17, with Sleeping Giants tweeting out the #StopHateForProfit hashtag to its more than 300,000 followers, calling on companies to join. Two days later, North Face was the first to sign up, saying it would stay off Facebook “until stricter policies are put in place to stop racist, violent or hateful content and misinformation from circulating on the platform.” REI and Patagonia quickly followed. The other coalition partners worked their networks, too, both privately and publicly. The ADL, a Jewish organization founded in 1913, began circulating images showing advertisers Facebook posts alongside their ads. One Geico ad, for example, sat next to a post calling financier and philanthropist George Soros, a frequent target of anti-Semitism, “the face of evil.”",
            "Robinson told me he and Johnson did a video call with the CEO of Ben & Jerry’s and discussed the ice cream maker not just joining the boycott, but also calling on Unilever, the multinational conglomerate that owns Ben & Jerry’s, to join. On June 23, Ben & Jerry’s put out a powerful statement. Three days later, Unilever announced it would stop advertising on not just Facebook and Instagram, but Twitter, too, at least through the end of the year, citing corporate responsibility pledges and “the polarized atmosphere in the U.S.”",
            "Meanwhile, representatives from Mozilla reached out to the tech world, to explain how the company had stopped advertising on Facebook in 2018 and “how we’ve reinvested our own marketing dollars,” Mary Ellen Muckerman, the company’s interim chief marketing officer, told me. ",
            "“You know, it’s always, like, ‘fly by the seat of your pants and see what works,’” Rivitz of the launch. But this was a pretty good start.",
            "So far, the advertiser pull-outs represent only a fraction of Facebook’s revenue — analysts said at the start of this week that they still expect the company to have a strong quarter, with some $17 billion in sales — but the PR blitz and creeping sense that the site was becoming toxic to ad buyers got the site’s attention.",
            "The boycott organizers had hoped that keeping the push limited to a month would act as a forming mechanism, pushing Facebook to make quick changes. The coalition came up with 10 specific demands, among them installing a high-level executive with civil rights expertise, doing away with the fact-checking exemption for politicians’ speech and creating human points of contact for Facebook users experiencing identity-based harassment. ",
            "On the same day the campaign for the boycott launched, someone close to the situation tells me, Facebook called a rush meeting that pulled in officials from across teams — including its marketing, policy and legal operations — to discuss what to do.",
            "Then, on June 24, Sandberg emailed Johnson, Greenblatt and Robinson, according to a copy of the email seen by POLITICO. “At Facebook, we stand against racism and discrimination of any kind,” she wrote. “We are working to understand and address the concerns you outlined in your #StopHateforProfit campaign.” She mentioned the civil rights audit, “which has been in progress for two years,” and asked to continue the discussion in a meeting with her and Chris Cox, a Facebook veteran close to Zuckerberg who recently returned to the company to serve as chief product officer. ",
            "Two days later, in a rare move, Zuckerberg opened up the first few minutes of an employee meeting to announce some fairly minor changes to the company’s handling of elections and political content, such as banning posts that falsely claim that immigration officials will be visiting polling places and labeling some politicians’ posts that violate the site’s rules. The company also announced it would undergo a marketing audit that would examine, among other things, how safe its platform is for advertisers. And it removed hundreds of accounts associated with the so-called Boogaloo Boys, a far-right movement that sprung up around the George Floyd protests. The company published a list detailing how it is addressing or otherwise thinking about some of what boycott organizers had asked for. Clegg also issued his open letter, saying both that “Facebook does not profit from hate” and “We may never be able to prevent hate from appearing on Facebook entirely, but we are getting better at stopping it all the time.” ",
            "The boycott organizers say it’s not enough — that the changes are too small and Facebook’s explanations too vague to satisfy them yet.",
            "In response to Sandberg’s email, the advocates pressed to meet with Zuckerberg himself, not just Sandberg. On July 1, Facebook said it agreed. The conversation is being scheduled, both sides say, for after the Independence Day holiday.",
            "When I asked Robinson what he plans to say, he told me that’s the wrong way to think about it. Facebook requested the meeting, he points out, putting the onus on them: “They have our demands.”"

            "State legislators have introduced scores of police reform proposals, but few have become law as legislatures adjourn for the year.",
            "Just a little over two weeks after George Floyd was killed by a white Minneapolis police officer who pinned Floyd down with a knee on his neck, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz promised that the state “will change the way we do policing.” It hasn’t.",
            "Neither have the vast majority of other states across the country. Legislators in two dozen states have introduced scores of police reform bills since Floyd’s death on May 25, but just five governors have signed any of those measures into law.",
            "With federal legislation on policing stalled on Capitol Hill, the onus is on states and cities to pass laws to reform policing. But, like Congress, itself, most states have so far been unable to meet the moment. And even those that have taken action — New York, Utah, Colorado, Iowa and Oregon — have not gone nearly far enough, activists say. It’s yet another reminder that, despite the deluge of protests against police brutality and racism across the country and rising public support for police reform, the status quo still has the upper hand.",
            "In Minnesota, legislators introduced dozens of police-related bills last month, but thanks to partisan bickering, not one passed before lawmakers adjourned their legislative session. ",
            "All told, 30 state legislatures have already adjourned until 2021 — freezing reform efforts for at least six months. Eighteen of the states whose legislatures are still in session are considering dozens of bills, according to a National Conference of State Legislatures database, but all but a handful are stuck in committee. ",
            "New York was one of the first states to act, when Gov. Andrew Cuomo signed laws on June 15 and 16 instituting a series of reforms requiring state police officers to wear body cameras, creating a Law Enforcement Misconduct Investigative Office and mandating that courts compile and publish racial and other demographic data of low-level offenses. New laws also require officers to verbally report instances in which they discharge their weapon in a situation where someone could be hit by a stray bullet and for police and peace officers and other law enforcement representatives to provide medical and mental health attention to anyone in custody.",
            "In Utah, Gov. Gary Herbert signed legislation barring peace officers’ use of chokeholds or restraints that could cause unconsciousness and prohibiting those officers from being trained in use of that technique. ",
            "Colorado and Iowa also both enacted new laws before their legislatures adjourned in June. Colorado Gov. Jared Polis signed a comprehensive bill that requires body cameras by 2023 and public release of footage after receipt of a misconduct complaint. The new law also prohibits chokeholds, ends qualified immunity and requires peace officers to intervene when another officer is using unlawful force and an annual report on data involving use of force, contacts by peace officers, unannounced entries by peace officers and resignations from peace officers while under investigation for violating department policy. ",
            "Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds signed a bill that strengthens restrictions on law enforcement officers’ use of chokeholds and allows the state attorney general to prosecute officers whose actions result in someone’s death, among other things. ",
            "And on Tuesday, Gov. Kate Brown of Oregon signed five police-reform bills, including measures barring chokeholds, prohibiting use of tear gas and sound cannons and establishing a statewide database of police officer discipline records. ",
            "The remaining bills awaiting signature in other states include a ban on law enforcement’s use of chokeholds in Delaware unless “the person reasonably believes that the use of deadly force is necessary to protect the life of a civilian or a law enforcement officer” and another that would create a referendum for voters to determine whether to abolish the Glynn County Police Department in Georgia and transfer its responsibilities to the county sheriff. The county police department handled the investigation into the death of Ahmaud Arbery, a Black man who was chased down by white men and killed while jogging through a neighborhood.",
            "New Mexico lawmakers passed a bill last month requiring peace officers “who routinely interact with the public to wear a body-worn camera while on duty,” but Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham hasn’t signed it yet.",
            "Several governors have also taken executive action in recent weeks, almost all in states that haven’t succeeded in passing reforms through legislation. Cuomo is the lone exception: He issued an order that tasks cities to develop new policies alongside police chiefs and stakeholders or risk losing state and federal funding. ",
            "Gov. Ned Lamont of Connecticut’s order bars state police from using chokeholds and other restraints that restrict oxygen or blood flow to the head or neck, requires marked cars to have a dashboard camera and uniformed officers to wear a body camera and demilitarizes the police force by preventing purchase or acquisition of military and military-style equipment from the federal government.",

            "Such “procedural justice reforms,” Fernandez said, “attempt to mitigate harm after the fact,” such as abolishing qualified immunity, which shields officers from liability for constitutional violations that don’t break “clearly established” law. “We really need to focus on the front end of things, not the back end. This moment is an opportunity to implement transformational changes across the country.”",
            "Federal lawmakers, who will return to their districts this week for a two-week Fourth of July recess, have the power to make those kind of significant changes nationally. But with Democrats in control of the House and Republicans in power in the Senate, both sides would have to compromise on a bill President Donald Trump would support and sign into law — a seemingly quixotic endeavor as the 2020 election heats up and Trump tweets, “LAW AND ORDER,” from the White House.",

Across the political spectrum, only a small percentage of voters said police departments need no reforms at all.",

            "As the Democratic primary drew to its conclusion, a flurry of Students for Bernie college organizations made clear where they stood: There was no way they could vote for Joe Biden. If Sanders wasn’t the nominee, they planned to either sit out the fall election or vote third party.",
            "But as coronavirus deaths mount and Donald Trump strikes a law-and-order pose against the protests sweeping the nation, many of the leaders of those groups are rethinking their hard-line position. And faced with a choice between a candidate they distrust due to his lack of progressive bona fides, or ushering in the second term of an incumbent they loathe, more than a few leftist college student leaders are learning to live with Biden.",
            "“In recent weeks, it's become pretty clear that Trump is willing to crack down on free speech, and so it's definitely making me lean more toward Biden now,” said Harry Feldman, a Georgia Tech senior and co-chair of the school’s Young Democratic Socialists of America chapter, who was considering voting third party in Georgia. ",

            "Amira Chowdhury, co-director of a left-wing University of Pennsylvania group that vowed in late March it “will never endorse, nor support Joe Biden,” has also come around on the former vice president. She attributed it to what she called Trump’s failure of leadership, bigotry and racism in recent weeks and her role as a voter in a swing state that Trump captured by just over 44,000 votes in 2016.",
            "“With a heavy heart, and with great anger and frustration, and with great rage towards the Democratic establishment, I will vote for Biden,” said Chowdhury, whose Penn for Bernie group is now known as Penn Justice Democrats.",
            "The 77-year-old Biden still has a ways to go with all younger voters, a demographic cohort he struggled to gain traction with during the primary season. Chowdhury’s organization, for example, has declined to formally support the presumptive Democratic nominee.",

Trump’s response has made it even more clear how dangerous he is to them.”",
            "Baumann said he’s seen qualitative and quantitative evidence that young voters are shifting toward Biden due to Trump’s handling of the protests — even in cases where their opinion of Biden hasn’t drastically changed.",
            "Hayley Mon Goy, a Florida State University junior who supported Sanders in the Democratic primary, agreed that Trump’s response to the anti-racism and police brutality protests solidified her decision to vote for Biden, even though he was far from her first choice.",
            "“Looking at Trump now, he’s really shown his true colors in how he’s handling the situation in the country, not only with coronavirus, but with all the protests,” Mon Goy said. “As a progressive, even though people may not love Biden, it’s pushing them towards voting for him.”",

            "Activists want to defund the police. Biden won’t even legalize pot.",
            "At a megachurch in Phoenix this week, Donald Trump regaled a crowd of mostly maskless students with a story about the moment he said he knew he would win a second term.",
            "The president explained that he was in the White House recently and passed by a TV screen and saw the words “defund and abolish.”",
            "“What are they going to defund and abolish?” Trump said he asked. ",
            "“The police,” he was told.",
            "“Oh, great, I just won the election!”",
            "The data suggest otherwise. In fact, since the killing of George Floyd at the hands of a white police officer on May 25 and the rise of protests against police brutality and systemic racism, including activist calls to defund the police, Joe Biden’s average polling lead over Trump has doubled from 5 to 10 points. The day after Trump's Arizona event, The New York Times published a poll showing Trump down by a staggering 14 points.",
            "Trump might be forgiven for his misreading of the political situation. Some of Biden’s advisers had the same initial view of the politics of the protests. Biden’s campaign is led by an older and whiter group of operatives who came of age during a political era when many Democrats saw large-scale protests for racial equality as inherently alienating to many white voters. In some quarters of the party, street protest brought back the traumas of 1968 and Nixon’s 32-state landslide.",
            "“The first thought of someone my age is Nixon and law and order,” said an adviser to Biden, who is white and in his late 60s and admitted concern early on that the protests could benefit Trump. The person was granted anonymity in order to speak candidly. “But as long as we don’t have a reversion to looting and lawlessness, as long as it’s peaceful and about the inequality of society and the treatment of African Americans, this has seen a shift in Biden’s direction—and more than we thought it would be.”",
            "Biden did not endorse the controversial activist slogan, steering clear of Trump’s attacks. On June 10, he wrote an op-ed for USA Today laying out his views on police reform and stated unequivocally, “I do not support defunding police.”",
            "The spasms of vandalism and theft that marked some of the early protests have diminished, replaced by the targeted toppling of statues memorializing the Confederacy. Mitt Romney marched in Washington and said, “Black Lives Matter.” Polls reflected a seismic shift in the electorate’s attitudes: 76 percent of the public say racism and discrimination is a major problem, up from 68 percent in 2016. Seventy-one percent of white people agree. The Black Lives Matter movement now has majority support. ",
            "The expected revolt of white suburbanites against the protests hasn’t materialized. Instead, they’ve joined them.",
            "“This is no longer a traditional wedge issue because all of a sudden white Americans, particularly college educated whites, understand that racism is real,” said Cornell Belcher, a veteran Democratic pollster who worked for Barack Obama. “Those white suburban women now understand that they have skin in the racism game as well. And that changes everything.”",
            "But the question remains: What is Biden’s role as the Democratic nominee, as America reckons with racism? ",
            "Despite his consistent edge in polls, there are risks for Biden. Though he has endorsed banning chokeholds and reforming qualified immunity, his promotion of community policing has left activists and organizers in key states angry and concerned that he’s missing a moment to be bolder. Internally, Biden’s campaign is balancing how to best respond to the transformational demands of protesters while maintaining his commanding lead over Trump. Biden gained the lead by staying largely out of the spotlight as Trump has praised the “beautiful heritage” of the Confederacy and called protesters “thugs.”",
            "If elected president, Biden must force a “frank, truthful, painstaking conversation” about America’s racism, said Rep. Bobby Rush (D-Ill.).",
            "“I'm not sure if he has the understanding, but he has to become a transcendental president,” Rush said. The opportunity is here; the question is, can he rise up to it?”",
            "Biden’s advisers point out that racial justice is at the heart of why he’s running for president. He has often said that Trump’s 2017 comment praising “very fine people” at a pro-Nazi rally in Charlottesville is what pushed him into the 2020 race. ",
            "“He’s been very clear he wouldn’t be running unless Donald Trump were president,” said Symone Sanders, a senior adviser to Biden.",
            "During the primaries, Biden bet everything on winning overwhelming support from African American voters, who eventually reversed the near collapse of his campaign in the first three states. ",
            "Biden’s advisers were often less attentive—and sometimes downright dismissive—of certain obsessions of the social media left. Biden did not discuss white privilege the way Kirsten Gillibrand did. He didn’t endorse reparations or the legalization of marijuana when some of his chief rivals did. He stubbornly insisted that the two most important primary constituencies were political moderates and older working-class African Americans, two groups without much influence online. The Biden campaign’s unspoken primary slogan could have been, “Twitter isn’t real life.” ",
            "This cautiousness and skepticism has spilled into the general election. One way to think of the Biden campaign’s navigation of racial issues is that he and his advisers care a lot more about addressing policy demands than they do about addressing cultural issues. ",
            "“There is a conversation that’s going on on Twitter that they don’t care about,” one Democratic strategist observed. “They won the primary by ignoring all of that. The Biden campaign does not care about the critical race theory-intersectional left that has taken over places like The New York Times. You can be against chokeholds and not believe in white fragility. You can be for reforming police departments and don’t necessarily have to believe that the United States is irredeemably racist.”",
            "Sanders offered a slightly more nuanced view. “It’s not that we’re dismissing anyone’s voice, because we hear the voices, we hear the feedback,” she said. “We are, though, laser-focused on making sure that we’re not running a campaign that only caters to the internet.” ",
            "Twitter is one thing. But what happens when the largest racial movement in 50 years—in response to the killings of Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor—collides with the campaign of a politician best known for hammering out cloakroom deals in the Senate?",
            "One view of how Biden sees his role is that he is self-aware enough to understand what an unlikely leader he is of a Democatic Party that has been characterized in the Trump era by the women’s movement that greeted his inauguration, the antiracism movement that is defining the final year of his term, and the millennial left that has risen in the years in between.",
            "“It’s important to remember what Vice President Biden said in the last couple of months that he intended to be a transition figure for the Democratic Party,” said Sen. Brian Schatz, the 47-year-old Democrat from Hawaii who is a favorite of progressives. Schatz argued that unlike Obama, who was a singular personality who “blocked out the sun” when it came to other Democratic leaders, Biden’s goal—as contradictory as it may seem—is to help raise up the new generation of Democrats, many of whom are to his left. ",
            "“He’s certainly at the helm as our nominee and as our party leader,” Schatz said. “But I think he understands that there is a movement that undergirds the left right now which is deeper and wider and more likely to last into the future regardless of who’s the titular head of the party.”",
            "A similar view comes from some activists who often have the most clear-eyed view of politicians, seeing them not as heroic shapers of history but merely as instruments who respond to pressure. ",
            "“I think Democrats didn’t know what to do at this moment and that’s typical,” said Maurice Mitchell, national director of the Working Families Party and a social movement strategist. “Movements operate with different prerogatives than traditional electoral politics. Mass movements always lead—they come up with new ideas and surface problems that aren’t new but the surfacing of the problem makes visible something that had been invisible because we’ve tolerated it for so long and the problem has become woven into the fabric of the country.”",
            "From this perspective, the fact that Biden is a relatively nonideological politician who has continuously shifted with the political tides to remain close to the consensus view of his party might be a feature, not a bug. “Nobody expects Vice President Biden to organize a direct action,” Mitchell said. “That’s not his job.”",
            "Just as Mitchell would expect, Democratic candidates across the country are recalibrating their positions on police reform and racial justice to catch up with the public. One Democratic campaign operative working on a Senate race said he was blown away by a recent poll his candidate commissioned. ",
            "“Racial issues were one of the top three concerns of the Democrats we polled,” he said. “It was right there with health care.” ",
            "Biden was quick to embrace two previously controversial positions: banning chokeholds and reforming qualified immunity for law enforcement officers, a change that Obama opposed as president. “Symone was like you gotta do this and he did it,” said a prominent Democrat who advises the campaign. “And he did it pretty quickly. The police hate it.”",
            "But other issues highlighted by the Black Lives Matter movement and its allies have not been embraced by the Biden campaign. And some Democrats worry the presumptive nominee’s reluctance could dampen enthusiasm for him among African American voters who have suffered disproportionately through the trio of 2020 crises: the coronavirus pandemic, the subsequent economic collapse and the epidemic of anti-Black policing.",
            "Activists have pointed out that over the past month, as thousands took to the streets in hundreds of cities, Biden’s policy platforms on criminal justice and policing have not changed on his website. In a letter to Biden’s campaign last week, more than 50 progressive groups criticized his response to the mass protests, calling on him to incorporate policies crafted by the Movement for Black Lives. ",
            "“Joe Biden doesn’t have to be a revolutionary,” said Jennifer Epps-Addison, president of the Center for Popular Democracy. “But he has to agree to actually bring folks who have been marginalized both by the Democratic and Republican Party to the table, and have a conversation about how we are going to ensure that we break down these systems of racial- and economic- and gender-based inequity in our country.” ",
            "Last July, as part of his criminal justice platform, Biden proposed injecting $300 million into the Community Oriented Policing Services program, which was created by the now-controversial 1994 crime bill and has had questionable success. To the dismay of many activists, Biden has stood by his COPS funding plan.",
            "“Folks that are not regular voters are looking for more than that,” said Cliff Albright, co-founder of Black Voters Matter. “Not all black voters equal the black electorate in the primaries; if he does not understand that, or doesn’t care to understand that, he runs the risk of losing.”",
            "For activists who’ve long led the Black Lives Matter movement, Biden’s unyielding defense of the COPS program is a disappointment and more important than getting Biden to say “defund the police.”",
            "“I don’t care if he never utters those three words,” Albright said. ",
            "A “unity” task force, created by Biden and Bernie Sanders, recently waded into the fraught debate over defunding the police, and efforts by Sanders’ appointees to push some version of a defund policy were dead on arrival, according to several people with direct knowledge of the matter.",
            "A senior adviser to the Biden campaign said there was almost no chance that Biden would nix his COPS proposal, arguing that those federal dollars allow Washington to shape police reform at the local level.",
            "Another flashpoint inside the campaign pits progressives against Biden stalwarts over the issue of legalizing marijuana, which has been hotly debated among members of the task force.",
            "Multiple people said marijuana policy has been discussed on the criminal justice panel, one of the policy groups of the unity task force. Sanders appointees have advocated for legalization. Some Biden appointees personally support legalizing pot and have debated putting the policy in the panel’s recommendations to the former vice president, according to two people familiar with its deliberations.",
            "Biden supports decriminalization, but has resisted calls to make cannabis legal—a reform endorsed by the majority of his primary opponents, including vice presidential contenders Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren. The criminalization of marijuana has contributed to the country’s mass incarceration problem, disproportionately affecting black men. ",
            "Chiraag Bains, a co-chair of the criminal justice task force tapped by Sanders, said Biden should “end the War on Drugs, including by legalizing marijuana.” He said those are his personal views, however, and he was not speaking as a leader of the task force.",
            "“There’s an opportunity to advance a really bold agenda on criminal justice,” he said. “This is part of envisioning a completely different future, not returning to a pre-Trump era. I say that as someone who served proudly in the Obama administration. We just have to be much more aggressive about rooting out systemic racism and injustice in the legal system.”",
            "Faiz Shakir, Sanders’ 2020 campaign manager who oversees the Sanders wing of the unity task force, confirmed that members have talked about issues such as marijuana, qualified immunity and defunding the police. Shakir, who declined to discuss details, said the fact that Biden announced support for reforming qualified immunity is a victory for progressives.",
            "There has been a sense in the wake of Floyd’s killing that Biden’s team has been more amenable to other reforms.",
            "Though activists and the young voters they represent want more, Democratic strategists say Biden’s evolution on policing may be enough for voters as long as they’re aware of his actual policies. ",
            "“Police reform [and] racial profiling are not a secondary issue consideration for these younger voters. They are in fact, a front-and-center primary issue consideration for these younger voters,” Belcher, the Democratic pollster, said. ",
            "He added, “If we go into August or after this convention and I’m in focus groups with millennials and they don’t understand where Joe Biden is on criminal justice reform, it is a failure on Democrats’ part.”"

            "The House on Thursday passed a sweeping police reform bill that would ban chokeholds, end the use of “no-knock” warrants, create a national registry for officers accused of misconduct, and make it easier to prosecute officers. Yet Democrats picked up only a few GOP votes, guaranteeing the proposal has no chance of moving in the Senate.",
            "And the Senate can’t even agree to begin debate on a police reform bill, with Democrats blocking efforts to take up a proposal drafted by Sen. Tim Scott (S.C.), one of two Black Republicans on Capitol Hill. ",
            "“It’s really unfortunate,” Scott said. “You’d like to think that we’re all willing to get together on something as consequential as police reform in a moment like this.” ",
            "Rather than restart their efforts to find a solution, party leaders are pointing fingers at the other, suggesting Washington's latest attempt at reform is all but finished. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and other GOP senators were infuriated when Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Republicans are “trying to get away with murder, actually. The murder of George Floyd.” They demanded she apologize. Pelosi refused. ",
            "Then Sen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.) angered Democrats when he suggested Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) had “a chokehold” on the Republicans’ version of police reform. Democrats said that comment showed GOP leaders weren’t serious about addressing the issue of police brutality.",

            "President Donald Trump, trailing badly in the polls, has turned to repeatedly tweeting out “Law and Order!,” a clear sign that he isn’t interested in anything Democrats were proposing. The president instead has threatened to use “overwhelming force” to end protests, urged “long-term prison sentences” for anyone caught tearing down statues, and accused the country’s first Black president of “treason.” Eric Trump, the president’s son, called Black Lives Matter protesters “animals” at a rally last week, to cheers from the crowd.",
            "It’s a level of nastiness between the two sides that’s become common in the Trump era, grinding non-essential legislative work to a halt and sapping any energy to move big bills, be it on immigration and infrastructure, or gun control and policing.",
            "The exception, of course, was the trillions of dollars that Congress approved this spring to respond to the coronavirus pandemic and stave off an economic meltdown — dual crises that forced both sides into rare bipartisan action. Although that, too, only came after weeks of theatrics from both parties. And with the explosive issue of police brutality and racism, what little opportunity there was for compromise quickly faded.",
            "“It’s bad,” said Sen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.). “The last three and a half years, the president’s tried to divide this country and he’s done a pretty effective job of it, and he’s divided the Democrats and Republicans to almost a toxic environment.”",
            "“There’s not one single conversation between a Democratic member and a Republican member in order to achieve a bipartisan bill in the House,” complained Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.). “At this moment of a presidential election year, a divided America, an economy in chaos, the health crisis, and layer on top of that we can’t physically be with one another to work things out, it makes the outcome this screwed up and awful.”",
            "In the days after Floyd’s murder in Minneapolis, there seemed to be an opening for real action — a groundswell moment that would force Democrats and Republicans to set aside their differences and deliver something to a restive and angry American public. ",

            "Frustrated rank-and-file members say they cast blame in both parties, with senior Republicans and Democrats working on their own separate tracks from the start. And it has infuriated many of the freshmen who rode a wave in 2018 vowing to end the Washington gridlock.",
            "Many lawmakers left town after the House vote on Thursday disappointed in the failure to act and worried about how the country will react to the breakdown.",

Dean Phillips (D-Minn.), who has frequently lamented that leaders of both parties don’t work toward consensus. “It’s always been my expectation, and frankly, dream, that [bipartisanship] starts in the very beginning But I think we do it in reverse here, too often.”",

I don’t see this situation as over at all,” Bass insisted. “I have a long list of my Republican colleagues from Judiciary who expressed opposition to all sorts of things in the hearing. I think that leaves a basis from which to talk.”",

            "“I think the amount of people in the street and the pressure has created a unique circumstance where I do believe both parties are feeling the heat to pass something,” Ocasio-Cortez said. ",

            "Every Democrat voted for the package, which was drafted by the Congressional Black Caucus in a matter of days amid multiracial demonstrations in dozens of cities seeking justice for George Floyd’s death. Ultimately just three Republicans — moderate Reps. Will Hurd (R-Texas), Fred Upton (R-Mich.) and Brian Fitzpatrick (R-Pa.) — backed the measure.",
            "Speaker Nancy Pelosi took the rare step of casting her vote and announcing the 236-181 tally. ",
            "The bill would crack down on excessive police force and ban chokeholds, enforce national transparency standards and push accountability for officer misconduct with a national database to track offenses.",
            "“To the protesters: we hear you, we see you, we are you,” House Democratic Caucus Chairman Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) said in an impassioned speech on the floor just before the vote.",

            "The three Republicans who ultimately supported the bill defied direct instructions from the White House to oppose it, handing a minor victory to Democrats, who can now say they passed a bipartisan police reform bill. Still, Democrats’ success likely ends there as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has signaled he will not take up the package, leaving virtually no hope it will become law.",
            "“Exactly one month ago George Floyd spoke his final words, 'I can’t breathe,' and changed the course of history,” Pelosi said on the steps of the Capitol before the vote. “When we pass this bill, the Senate will have a choice: to honor George Floyd’s life or to do nothing.”",
            "Thursday’s vote comes one day after the Senate failed to advance a narrower policing bill — leaving the two chambers at a stalemate even as the nation faces a reckoning on race and police brutality.",
            "Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, the Senate’s only Black Republican, was the lead author of the Senate’s police reform bill. But many Democrats dismissed the legislation, calling it a “sham” that only paid lip service to the systematic changes they say need to take place.",
            "“The Senate bill is [a] sham, fake reform,” said House Judiciary Chair Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) alongside Pelosi. “It gestures, using some of the same words, but it does nothing real.”",
            "Other Democrats, like Rep. Emanuel Cleaver of Missouri, a former CBC chairman, were slightly gentler in their criticism.",
            "“I have a lot of respect and admiration for Tim Scott … and so I believe that he tried to get as good a bill as he thought he could get with the Republican-led Senate,” Cleaver said in an interview.",

            "But Democrats, particularly senior members of the CBC, say the passage of their bill is a monumental step forward for a Congress that has allowed legislation to ban chokeholds or demilitarize the police to languish for years. In one sign of the enormity of the moment, Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) — who represents Minneapolis, including the block where Floyd died after a police officer put his knee on Floyd's neck for nearly nine minutes — presided over the House floor earlier in the day.",

Thank God for the screaming from the streets that has awoken a lot of people to how the severe disregard for life and racism has been playing out every day in America,” Rep. Brenda Lawrence (D-Mich.) said in an interview. “We need transformational change.”",
            "The House bill has won endorsements from a slew of prominent advocacy groups, from the NAACP to the AFL-CIO to the American College of Physicians. A long list of entertainment industry celebrities have signaled support as well, from Lizzo to Justin Bieber to Ariana Grande. On Thursday, the measure also earned backing from another set of powerful voices: the parents of African Americans killed by police.",
            "“The unjust killing of a loved one, especially at the hands of law enforcement, is a pain too many families have been forced to endure,\" said Gwen Carr, John Crawford Jr. and Samaria Rice — the parents of Eric Garner, John Crawford III and Tamir Rice, respectively. ",

            "Some Democrats and Republicans had initially hoped to send legislation to President Donald Trump’s desk before the July Fourth holiday — a scenario that is now unlikely.",
            "Democrats have refused to scale back the central components of their bill, such as banning chokeholds or abolishing the “qualified immunity” doctrine that protects police officers from lawsuits. Republicans, meanwhile, have said they will simply move on to the rest of their summer agenda until Democrats signal a willingness to back down on some of those elements.",
            "Several Democrats had been quietly working with moderate Republicans like Hurd, Upton and Fitzpatrick in the last few weeks in a behind-the-scenes effort to garner their support for the bill. ",
            "Still, most Republicans voted against the policing bill with several citing one major issue as the primary reason for the stalemate: whether police should be held personally liable for misconduct on the job. Trump also publicly urged GOP lawmakers to oppose the bill, and few in the party are eager to cross him.",
            "Within the Democratic Caucus, the package ran into remarkably little resistance, which has historically faced some internal divisions between its moderate and progressive factions. ",

            "The CBC is in the spotlight as Washington faces a reckoning on police brutality.",
            "This may be the most pivotal moment for the Congressional Black Caucus in its nearly 50 years of existence.",
            " The group has never been more influential in Washington, now playing an outsize role among House Democrats and the broader party. Several CBC members are being vetted as possible vice presidential picks, and others are being talked about as future speakers. CBC members now chair four major House committees, with even more possible next year. And no major bill goes through the House without Democrats asking, “What does the CBC say?”",
            " Yet it’s also a tumultuous time to be Black in America, including for the CBC and the veteran lawmakers who make up its ranks. Black and minority communities have suffered inordinately from the coronavirus pandemic. The deaths of African Americans while in police custody continue to roil the nation and have turned Black Lives Matter into a global movement. And Congress — once again — appears to be paralyzed over how to confront police brutality and systemic racism.",
            " “It’s true,” House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn (D-S.C.) said of the CBC’s mounting influence in the current political landscape. “But only because — for the first time — people are able to visualize what the CBC has been trying to talk about for a long time.”",
            " “All of a sudden, these [videos] are out there. And people are beginning to see what we’ve been seeing for a long, long time,” Clyburn added.",
            "Clyburn, the highest ranking African American in Congress, was pivotal in helping secure the Democratic presidential nomination for Joe Biden with a decisive victory in the South Carolina primary. Black voters remain the bedrock of Biden’s base heading into the November election. ",
            " The videotaped killing of George Floyd and the huge outpouring of support for BLM has also brought to the forefront a much more aggressive group of progressive activists who are not satisfied with incrementalism.",
            " These activists are willing to tear down political shibboleths as much as they’re willing to tear down statues of once-venerated Americans. And that puts the CBC, not to mention the broader Democratic Party, in a political bind: They need to deliver results now.",
            " Rep. Karen Bass, who is in her second year as chair of the CBC, spent years as a civil rights activist in Los Angeles — where she was sometimes harassed by the city’s police officers — before launching her political career in California. The five-term Democrat said she understands the pressure from protesters in the streets calling for more drastic action than what’s in the policing bill being considered on the House floor Thursday.",
            " “It is the role of an activist to push us as far as they can push us. It is our role to legislate, and that is a different role,” Bass said in an interview. “It takes an outside and an inside strategy to bring about change. We work on the inside, we know what is realistic. We are very committed to making a difference, and that is different than making a point. You can either make a point, or you can make a difference.”",
            " Bass — who saw her home city torn apart by riots after the Rodney King beating nearly 30 years ago — said she and her colleagues in the CBC must craft a response that can actually pass, or risk squandering the chance entirely.",
            "“Personally, I always want to do more. But again, I want to be successful with the legislation,” Bass said.",
            " Bass and other members of the CBC said they recognize the immensity of this moment and the spotlight their caucus has after years of feeling like leaders in both parties didn’t prioritize issues facing Black Americans. That includes some of the same policing measures that the House is preparing to pass, including a ban on chokeholds and language to make it easier to sue police officers for misconduct.",
            " “We have had, for years, individual members of the Black Caucus who have submitted legislation, and it was kind of just, ‘Yeah, yeah, we hear you.’ People sign on, but it doesn't go anywhere,” said Rep. Brenda Lawrence (D-Mich.).",
            " “Now, to actually see members of Congress look to us for leadership, look to us for direction, for advice, and counting on us to help get this right — there’s a tremendous amount of, I would say, pressure, I say that personally, that we make a difference and we get this right,” Lawrence said.",
            "For some, the challenge is bigger than any in the CBC’s history.",
            " “Make no mistake, this is a CBC moment. This is what those founders wanted to have in place at a time of crisis,” said Rep. Emanuel Cleaver (D-Mo.), a former chair of the group. ",
            " “We have been placed on center stage of this American racial and justice moment. … Things are in place and we cannot flunk this moment,” he added, noting the scores of young activists who continue to demonstrate across the country as they look to the CBC for guidance and change.",
            " The CBC had already been “all hands on deck” this spring, as members described it, as the coronavirus pandemic disproportionately hit Black communities. Its members were deeply involved in the House’s multitrillion dollar pandemic relief bills, pushing hard to ensure money went to the neediest families and to minority-owned businesses that already struggled with access to capital.",
            "Floyd’s death in late May — and the national reckoning on race that has followed — put the CBC even more squarely in focus. Clyburn, Bass and other senior Black Democrats immediately took the lead on the legislative response, with white lawmakers, including Speaker Nancy Pelosi, intentionally staying on the sidelines.",
            " “In this moment, the CBC is known not only as the ‘conscience of the Congress,’ but really, the place where action is happening. It’s not just a moral compass question. It is, ‘How do we act? How do we respond?’” Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester (D-Del.) said in an interview.",
            " Still, the House bill faces slim odds of being passed in the Senate, which deadlocked over a narrower GOP proposal Wednesday. Real policing reform, Democrats say, may not come until after November if they can take back the White House and Senate — a reality that may further frustrate activists.",
            "Meanwhile, the CBC has been undergoing its own changes, as its members and those of the House Democratic Caucus at large skew younger and more progressive.",
            " Some of the most prominent members of the organization — John Conyers, Elijah Cummings and Charles Rangel — have retired or died. The 80-year-old Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.), a hero of the civil rights movement, has been battling pancreatic cancer.",
            " Yet after the 2018 elections, the CBC’s ranks grew by nine, including trailblazing members from suburban Connecticut and upstate New York representing majority-white districts.",
            " The CBC’s ranks are poised to grow even further in 2020, particularly as the scourge of anger over systemic racism begins to seep into this year’s elections. Several Black candidates saw an unexpected surge in Tuesday’s primaries with several winning in landslides. Two candidates in New York are likely to become the first openly gay Black members of Congress.",
            " Among the successful Black candidates on Tuesday was Jamaal Bowman, a liberal challenger who appears to have knocked down 31-year incumbent Rep. Eliot Engel (D-N.Y.). This came despite Engel’s backing from the CBC.",
            " It wasn’t unusual for the CBC to back Engel, a longtime white ally, over a Black candidate in his primary. Commitment to seniority has long been a bedrock CBC principle — a necessary system, they argued, to ensure that Black lawmakers are able to assume their rightful leadership roles within the caucus, instead of being passed over for less senior white members, as in decades past.",
            " But that seniority system has been repeatedly questioned in recent years, with members no longer content to wait decades to become committee chairs or party leaders. And those younger members have questioned the value of a system that has kept some older Democrats in leadership positions long after they stop being effective just to maintain seniority.",
            " Most recently the issue has popped up on the campaign trail, with the CBC facing criticism for endorsing white incumbents over Black primary challengers. The CBC took heat for backing white Rep. Mike Capuano over Black challenger Ayanna Pressley in 2018, and once again in this cycle for supporting Engel over Bowman. ",
            "Rep. Gregory Meeks (D-N.Y.), chairman of the CBC’s campaign arm, staunchly defended the decision to support Engel and other white incumbents over Black challengers. Engel, Meeks said, has fought for years against police brutality in his Bronx district. And just because it is now a majority-minority district, that shouldn’t automatically disqualify a white candidate, Meeks added.",
            " “He went to jail, he fought … he was out there supporting those issues in those times. So that means something, you don’t throw that away,” Meeks said. “You judge a person based upon the merit of their service. So if you earn it, that’s who we support.” ",
            " Other CBC members now say its endorsement policy should be reevaluated, even as they acknowledge the internal struggle over shunning a long-time Democrat — who may have been a strong advocate for the Black community — in support of a Black challenger.",
            " “We’re hard-pressed to say that we don’t want someone because of the color of their skin to continue to serve. Having gone through so many times we’ve been excluded. It is hard,” Lawrence added.",
            " But Lawrence said she would encourage the CBC to withhold endorsements in certain races in the future, for instance, if there is a “qualified African American challenger” running against an incumbent.",
            " “Black candidates are running and fighting and qualified to run for office,” said Lawrence, who fought in a tough primary herself before coming to Congress. “We are going to have to look at that.”"

            " The 55-45 vote came a week after Republicans unveiled the measure, led by Sen Tim Scott (R-S.C.), the only African American GOP senator. Senate Democrats, who have their own proposal to curb police misconduct, argued the bill didn't go nearly far enough. Sens. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), Doug Jones (D-Ala.) and Angus King (I-Maine) voted with all Republicans to proceed — short of the 60 votes needed to advance.",
            " The outcome is a deadlocked Senate once again, with both parties accusing the other of failing to negotiate in good faith, even as the country engages in a reckoning over police brutality in the aftermath of George Floyd’s killing by Minneapolis police. Still, senior lawmakers were reluctant to admit the debate was completely finished.",
            "\"Mitch McConnell has a way of trying to bully us around and he thinks he can get his way, and if past is prologue... our caucus held together and each time he came back,\" said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) after the vote. \"The Republican Party sees the handwriting on the wall, they see what the American people feel.\"",
            "Prior to the vote, McConnell defended Scott's proposal and accused Democrats of giving a \"last-minute ultimatum\" by turning \"this routine step into a partisan impasse.\"",
            " McConnell also demurred when asked when he would bring the bill back up after Democrats filibustered it. “Well, we will let you know. It can be done under a motion to reconsider at any point,” he told reporters. McConnell took procedural steps to bring the bill up quickly on the floor anytime this year if he wants. ",
            " Senate Republicans argued that Wednesday’s vote was a way to begin the police reform debate and that the process would allow for consideration of amendments. Democrats said there’s no point in voting to advance a bill they see as fatally flawed and that won’t have the 60 votes needed to pass the Senate.",
            " Instead, Democrats called on Republicans to come back to the negotiating table to come up with a bipartisan solution that the Senate could then vote on. The Senate minority is particularly frustrated that GOP leaders put the bill on the floor before holding any talks to craft the plan or consider it in committee.",

The House is set to pass a sweeping Democratic police reform proposal Thursday.",

            "When Lightfoot asked why they made the stop, the answer was stunning in how routine it turned out to be, she recalled: “We thought the kid had a gun.” Did he? “No, we were wrong,” they said. And they went on about their day after Lightfoot scolded them.",
            "“That had a really, lasting impression on me,” said Lightfoot, who is now Chicago’s mayor — the first African American woman to hold the office. “Those are the kind of things where you … don’t feel like you have claim to the geography under your feet, where people can just be stopped for any or no reason. How do you build on that? How do you have trust?”",
            "Lightfoot, a Democrat, swept last year's run-off election as a reform candidate willing to challenge the power structure of city government. Law enforcement in Chicago already had a troubling track record of civil rights violations that led to a consent decree with the Justice Department under the Obama administration, a process the department still operates under. She was also tapped to be president of the city's Police Board, a civilian oversight panel, by her predecessor, Rahm Emanuel.",
            "Once an outside agitator, Lightfoot is now on the inside battling on multiple fronts. She's caught between a defensive police department and warring with its union while staring down activists in the streets who don't believe her ideas match the scale of the problem. What's layered on top are many of the same struggles other liberal mayors across the country are confronted with while trying to keep a deadly pandemic at bay: eroding relationships between the police and communities of color, a whopping $700 million budget hole, streets filled with protests over the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, and bursts of everyday violence.",
            "The police confrontation that disturbed Lightfoot more than 20 years ago still plays all over America today. But she's not prepared to align herself with efforts to “defund the police,” a movement energized by Floyd's death, nor does she believe it conflicts with her own work to overhaul local law enforcement.",
            "“Defund the police” is a “nice hashtag,” Lightfoot said, but it ignores how reform works, will hurt efforts to diversify the force, and goes against what Chicago residents are telling her they want. That resistance has been echoed by Democratic mayors in New York, Los Angeles, Atlanta, and Washington, D.C., where Mayor Muriel Bowser recently said “We fund the police at the level that we need it funded.\"",
            "Lightfoot, who sat down for a wide-ranging interview about police reform in the aftermath of Floyd's death, said the debate about overhauling law enforcement is more nuanced than protesters will admit.",
            "“Not a single person” Lightfoot has spoken to from Chicago’s neighborhoods has said they want fewer police officers on hand, she said a day after one of the city’s most violent weekends of the year where 106 people were shot and 14 killed, including a 3-year-old. ",
            "Literally “defund” the police, Lightfoot said, puts newer recruits the city needs at risk because they lack seniority. “We'd have to get rid of the youngest, most diverse, most well-trained officers.\"",
            "While Lightfoot may butt heads with the demands of “defund” protesters, she seems to align with the principles in spirit. ",
            "“The status quo has failed,” she said. ",
            "And she agrees with redirecting officers so they’re not answering social-service-related calls that they’re not always equipped to handle. The first responder has been police, and “that doesn't make sense. And we know that,” she said. The city is looking at models used in other cities where dispatchers are trained to know who to send to an emergency call — maybe it’s a police officer, maybe a social worker, or both.",
            "In her view, there’s a middle ground that includes more transparency, and officers who are licensed — an idea supported by Illinois’ Attorney General Kwame Raoul and Secretary of State Jesse White, two statewide Black elected officials.",
            "Lightfoot says licensing would set standards and “hold people accountable” for their actions.",
            "“You go and get your nails done, you get your hair cut, you get your oil change. All those people are licensed and certified by the state,” Lightfoot said. “We talk about policing being a noble profession, but there is no uniform standard across the country.”",
            "A lack of transparency, means bad cops today can leave one town and go to another, with no one being the wiser.",
            "Lightfoot also said reform must include resolving a contract with the Fraternal Order of Police that lapsed three years ago. ",
            "“No police union is going to give up hard-fought rights easily, and I expect a fight. But I’m optimistic,” she said, referring to a police contract with Chicago Police. Lightfoot hopes to hear word from an arbitrator this week on where that stands.",
            "Lightfoot’s biggest move toward reform started long before Floyd’s killing seized the nation's attention. She initiated INVEST South/West, a program that’s funneling hundreds of millions of dollars into the city’s South and West sides, areas hardest hit by violence and long ignored by previous administrations focused more on building Chicago’s downtown.",
            "The goal of INVEST South/West is to improve public safety and attract businesses to invest in the neighborhoods, an effort that takes time, Lightfoot acknowledged.",
            "All her ideas — on transparency and licensing, a union contract and business investment — aren’t “something you can snap your fingers” and make happen.",
            "“You’re talking about building authentic, lasting relationships. And in some instances, you're starting with some partnership. In some other instances you're starting with nothing,” Lightfoot says. “That’s hard work. But it's necessary work. And we've got to take the time that is necessary to build those trusting relationships.”"

        "body": [
            "Senate Democrats are poised to filibuster the Republican plan — and Harris' efforts could help position her to join Biden's ticket.",
            "Senate Democrats are preparing to torpedo Republicans’ police reform proposal. And vice-presidential frontrunner Kamala Harris is leading the way.",
            " It’s a critical moment for Harris, who has faced scrutiny over her record as a former state attorney general. But as she finds herself in the middle of a messy congressional debate over how to stop police killings of Black people, she has a national platform that others in contention for vice president simply can't match.",
            "After largely hunkering down since leaving the presidential race, the California Democrat was front-and-center in the Senate on Tuesday, which will go down as a pivotal day in the movement to tackle police misconduct and also, potentially, in the maneuvering to be Joe Biden’s running mate.",
            "The California Democrat tore into a GOP proposal from Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.) as inadequate before he even finished writing it. She coordinated with former 2020 rival Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) on a letter rejecting the GOP’s approach on the floor. And she tangled with a senior Republican on the Senate floor over Democrats’ opposition to even debating the GOP bill, producing a moment that went viral on the left. ",
            " Harris also conceded it may take until after November with a new Congress and White House to pass the kind of reform that she thinks the nation needs.",
            "“We cannot proceed with what they’re offering. It’s empty. It’s empty,” she told a pair of reporters on Tuesday. “There’s no question that if we are in the majority in the Senate and that if Joe Biden were president there would be a lot more movement.”",
            " Harris added that she’s “not at all” thinking about her prospects to join Biden’s ticket after spending an hour on the floor trashing the GOP’s approach as “not meeting the moment” and debating Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas). She called working on law enforcement issues “part of my life’s work.” And she declined to address her private talks on police reform with the presumptive Democratic nominee.",
            " Harris said if Republicans started work on the legislation in the Senate Judiciary Committee rather than bringing it directly to the floor, Democrats might find themselves in a far different place. Instead, they are preparing on Wednesday to filibuster a GOP bill because it doesn’t establish strong new federal policing standards, which could stop the police reform effort in Congress until next year.",
            " “She could show some leadership by helping us get started so then we can work toward a consensus,” Cornyn said after their confrontation. “It’s not rational. So it’s hard to understand. It’s almost like these folks haven’t been in the Senate very long and they don’t know how to legislate.”",
            "Harris’ combative appearance Tuesday recalled the most memorable moments of her relatively brief tenure as a senator, including staring down Trump appointees Bill Barr, Jeff Sessions, and John Kelly — and tearing into Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh during his confirmation hearings.",
            " Again, it was the unscripted rejoinders that garnered her the most attention. Before Harris could finish her speech, Cornyn, a fellow Judiciary Committee member, interrupted to remind her that her anti-lynching legislation was part of the Republican reform effort.",
            " She quickly rejected the idea of using it as a bargaining chip and said “It’s like saying to a mother, ‘Save one of your children and leave the others.’”",
            " The standoff ended with a quintessential Harris moment — a curt reply that stops an opponent in their tracks — which her Senate aides quickly shared on Twitter.",
            " “Don’t you think that sort of interaction and debate and negotiation out in front of all 330 million Americans would be beneficial to healing our country and coming to some consensus about what the appropriate reforms should be?” Cornyn asked.",
            " “Indeed,” Harris shot back, referencing her earlier critique of the GOP’s process. “That is the beauty of the Judiciary Committee. Our meetings are public meetings.”",
            " While Harris and her party were pummeled by the right after they went public with their opposition to even beginning floor debate on the GOP’s bill, their position is backed in the civil rights community.",
            " “The black community is tired of the lip service,” said Ben Crump, the prominent civil rights attorney who is representing George Floyd’s family. “Kamala has achieved changes in California from working within the system and coordinating with us who are not inside. Now she’s doing that nationally.”",
            " Harris has not exactly emerged as a bipartisan deal-cutter in her short Senate career. She was one of just three Democrats to oppose a centrist immigration compromise in 2018. But she did back the bipartisan criminal justice reform bill, and Booker defended her willingness to get a deal with the Trump administration — even as the president has bragged about it regularly.",
            "\"How many things does she have to do demonstrably to show she’s beyond politics when it comes to issues of racial justice?” Booker said. ",
            " Scott said that while he’s been talking frequently to Booker, he didn’t connect with Harris until a bipartisan meeting on Tuesday, about 24 hours before the upcoming vote. Scott said it yielded no “discernible” progress.",
            " “I’ve tried to touch base with her on several occasions. We’ve been playing phone tag and text tag and we had four different meetings set up that keep getting canceled,” Scott said. “She has not been a part of the conversations I’ve had.”",
            " A Harris aide acknowledged they had difficulty connecting but disputed that four meetings were set up and canceled.",
            " Aside from brisk Senate votes, Harris has largely stayed with her husband in their Washington apartment since the coronavirus quarantines. A leading contender to join Biden on the ticket — and the only black woman in the Senate — she spent weeks focused on bills to help small businesses and address health disparities of people of color amid the pandemic.",
            " But since the killing of Floyd by police in Minneapolis galvanized the movement around police accountability and racial justice, Harris has worked to become a key voice on the issues, appearing at protests and taking the lead on the reforms.",
            " Crump said he wants to see a black woman picked as Biden’s No. 2, and Harris’ resolve in the Senate on police reform has only solidified his opinion of her. ",
            " “Kamala would be an outstanding vice president,” he said. “She has the right temperament. She has the sensitivity to listen when necessary, but to lead when it is required on issues that matter.”",
            " Her push has also won over some skeptics who viewed her as too accommodating to law enforcement over her career as a prosecutor and state attorney general and believe she squandered several chances to advocate for ambitious changes in those roles.",
            "Negotiations over the fate of the Democrats’ police reform bill, which calls for banning chokeholds and no-knock warrants and would make it easier to sue police officers accused of wrongdoing, again tested her taste for concession. This time, Harris’ advocacy among congressional Democrats was “central” to Democrats' approach, said Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.).",
            " Harris, Booker and Schumer were coordinating for weeks, since the Democratic bill was introduced and throughout the GOP’s rollout of its own legislation. Harris even panned Scott’s legislation before it was introduced, showing she decided early on his approach fell short of what was needed.",
            " Had Harris chosen to weaken the Democratic bill, and then brought her caucus along, she would have faced considerable backlash from activists wary of accepting what they view as political window dressing. At the same time, some Democrats said they worried about acquiescing to something that would allow Trump to claim progress on the issue — however modest — at a crucial time in his re-election bid.",
            " “This is the floor. This is the minimum that can be done right now,” said Lynda Garcia, policing campaign director at the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights. ",
            " Garcia, a veteran of the Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division, said in order for the outlined reforms to work, they have to be enacted together. Still, she and others conceded that they still worry about not passing any legislation at a time when people are hungry for reform.",
            " “There are folks out there who think making these sorts of changes still falls short of the changes that need to happen, such [as] shrinking the role of law enforcement and pulling them away from public health issues,” Garcia said. “But I do think there will be a lot of disappointment and a lot of discord if they don’t pass something.”"

            "Mayor Jenny Durkan said the violence was distracting from changes sought by thousands of peaceful protesters opposing racial inequity and police brutality. She said at a news conference that the city is working with the community to bring the “Capitol Hill Occupied Protest” zone, or CHOP, to an end and that police soon would move back into a precinct building they had largely abandoned in the area.",
            " Durkan also vowed to address some of the protesters’ demands, including investing more in Black communities, reimagining policing in cooperation with community leaders, and pushing for accountability measures and statewide reform of police unions.",
            "The mayor did not give an immediate timeline for clearing out the occupation but said “additional steps” would be examined if people don’t leave voluntarily.

            "As part of a Justice Department-led drive to crack down on violence growing out of protests spurred by George Floyd’s killing at the hands of Minneapolis police, the federal government is prosecuting more than 70 people for alleged behavior that runs the gamut from mere vandalism, to inciting looting through Facebook Live posts, to arson, and, in one case, murder.

In another case, federal authorities charged a man with possession of a Molotov cocktail, arguing that because he had used an imported bottle of Patron Citronge Pineapple Tequila to make the incendiary device, the case fell under the federal government’s regulation of foreign commerce.",

The violence and looting has in fact been stopped almost everywhere almost entirely through the applications of state and local authorities.”",
            "Since the first days of the recent protests, Trump has repeatedly taken to Twitter to call for “LAW & ORDER,” pushed governors to be more forceful against any unrest and even urged use of deadly force against looters. He also has explicitly endorsed aggressive use of federal statutes.",

            "While prosecutors describe the defendants’ activities ominously, there are early signs that some judges do not see them all that way. In some instances, judges have freed the defendants to await trial at home, over the objections of Justice Department attorneys.",
            "One prominent example of a controversial federal case spurred from an incident on May 31, when protesters rallying against police brutality took to the streets of Mobile, Ala., holding a series of vigils and marches. Most were peaceful, but in the late afternoon a crowd of hundreds of people attempted to march up a ramp onto an interstate highway. Police blocked the on-ramp and a tense standoff followed.",
            "At some point, police used tear gas to disperse the crowd. In the ensuing chaos, a woman with a red bandana around her neck used a bat to break a window of a parked, empty police cruiser and ran off, according to video from a local TV station, WKRG.",
            "The woman, Tia Pugh, 21, was later arrested by Mobile police and charged with inciting a riot and criminal mischief, both misdemeanors under Alabama law. After Pugh was released on bail, the FBI and federal prosecutors stepped in, charging her with an obscure federal felony offense: interfering with a police officer in the course of “civil disorder.”",
            "The crime was one of several anti-riot provisions included in the Civil Rights Act of 1968, passed in the wake of civil unrest in cities across the U.S. in the mid-1960s.",
            "“I consider it a very weak case,” Pugh’s court-appointed lawyer, Gordon Armstrong, said in an interview. “This is just a 21-year-old, impressionable, proud, young woman with no criminal record who’s never been arrested. She did something dumb. Does she need to have a federal felony follow her around for the rest of her life?”",
            "After Pugh’s arrest on the state charges, she spoke briefly to reporters as she was walked in handcuffs past cameras to a waiting police car. ",
            "\"Genocide is happening. We're being murdered in the streets for no absolutely no reason and unarmed. We're being disarmed when we arm ourselves,” Pugh said.",
            "“Why do you think that helps your cause, by breaking a window?” a reporter asked.",
            "\"This is not the point,” Pugh replied, arguing the focus on the window was “a distraction.”",
            "The Justice Department is also invoking the same rarely used “civil disorder” statute to prosecute a Washington state man, Aaron Wood, 21, for breaking a police car window during a roving protest in Wilmington, Del., on May 30.",
            "The federal complaint says Wood threw a brick through the back window of an occupied Wilmington police cruiser during an evening of protests and violence that included the looting of a number of stores in the city’s downtown area.",
            "Wood was initially arrested by Wilmington police, released because of a computer failure and then rearrested on state charges, the affidavit says.",
            "“Peaceful protest does not extend to the lawless destruction of private or public property,” U.S. Attorney David Weiss said in a news release. “Thankfully, the defendant’s violent actions did not result in physical harm to the [Wilmington Police Department] officer driving the police car attacked by the defendant. I commend WPD’s collaboration with the FBI and their efforts to quickly identify and bring the defendant to justice.”",
            "Asked about criticism that federal prosecutors are overreaching in some cases, the Justice Department defended its decisions.",
            "“U.S. attorneys are vested with the clear discretion and authority to bring federal charges where they are warranted by facts and the law,” a DOJ spokesman said. “They are also the chief law enforcement officers in their districts and have worked together with federal, state and local law enforcement to hold those accountable who have exploited a legitimate protest movement to seed chaos and commit crimes.”",
            "Weiss, the U.S. attorney in Delaware, said in a statement to POLITICO: “My office will continue, as it always has, to carefully consider and exercise its discretion and authority to prosecute violations of federal law in support of public safety.” ",
            "A spokesperson for the U.S. Attorney in Mobile, Richard Moore, declined to comment.",
            "Justice Department guidelines detail a series of factors for federal prosecutors to consider when deciding whether to bring charges in a case that can be or is being prosecuted by local authorities.",
            "“When it appears that the federal interest in prosecution is less substantial than the interest of local, state, or foreign authorities, consideration should be given to referring the case to those authorities rather than commencing or recommending a federal prosecution,” the DOJ policy says.",
            "Like many other federal laws, the “civil disorder” statute uses a connection to interstate commerce as a hook for federal jurisdiction. Under the Constitution’s Commerce Clause, the federal government has authority to regulate activities that impact either foreign or interstate commerce. ",
            "Prosecutors allege the Alabama and Delaware protests impeded interstate commerce in the form of traffic on interstate highways and that the Wilmington unrest also did so through damage to businesses in that city.",
            "However, Pugh’s attorney Armstrong says that connection is shaky in her case. Protesters never made it onto the highway. Prosecutors say commerce was affected because drivers of trucks bearing hazardous materials were told to divert in case the protesters made it onto the interstate.",
            "At a court hearing last week, Armstrong questioned an FBI agent about whether any trucks actually diverted during the demonstration. The agent had a letter from an Alabama highway official confirming the directive to divert, but no proof anyone was affected.",
            "“I spent quite a bit of time on: Is there evidence any truck was diverted? The answer to that is, ‘No,’” he said. “If they can’t show commerce was in any way affected, then it’s no longer a federal matter. That’s the real issue in the case, not whether she broke a window.”",
            "At the hearing, U.S. Magistrate Judge Bradley Murray said there was enough evidence to let the case against Pugh proceed, but he said prosecutors would need more to press forward with the case, according to Armstrong. The judge also ordered Pugh’s release over the objections of prosecutors.",
            "Unlike the demonstrators in Mobile, some of the protesters in Wilmington actually made it onto the interstate, blocking I-95 for about an hour. However, the shattering of the police cruiser window that led to the federal case against Wood took place roughly an hour after the demonstrators left the highway.",
            "Among the prominent lawyers and policymakers who have warned about the federal government using the Commerce Clause to claim expansive power is Barr.",
            "“The Framers believed in the principle of subsidiarity — that is, that matters ought to be handled by the smallest, lowest competent authority that was closest to the people,” Barr said in February at a conference for religious broadcasters. “The Framers conceived that the vast majority of collective decision-making by the people about their affairs would be done at the state and local level.”",
            "Barr directly criticized the federal government’s reliance on the Commerce Clause, saying it has “ballooned far beyond its original understanding.”",
            "Despite the warnings from Barr and some legal academics, the Supreme Court has endorsed the federal government’s power to intervene in situations with marginal impact on interstate commerce, though it has occasionally ruled that measures go too far.",
            "Other recent cases have taken a different tack as establishing federal jurisdiction: arguing that defendants used the internet to foment illegal activity.",
            "Prosecutors grabbed headlines earlier this month when they arrested Ca’Quintez Gibson, 26, on a charge of using the internet to incite a riot. Gibson was accused of making a series of Facebook Live posts encouraging looting at a large, indoor shopping mall in Peoria, Ill., as well as at a strip mall and other locations.",
            "“It’s going up tonight. Long as you all at Northwoods Mall. It’s going up. Period. ’cause I know it’s more than just me gonna step. Period,” Gibson said in one video. “We ain’t with that peaceful s---.”",
            "Following Gibson’s arrest, U.S. Attorney for Central Illinois John Milhiser, said it was important to put people like Gibson behind bars.",
            " “We will use all available resources to identify bad actors and get them off the streets to keep our communities safe,” Milhiser said.",
            "However, just five days later, a magistrate judge ordered Gibson released on a fairly lax form of home detention, with permission to work, attend church and other activities. He was ordered to stay off the internet and keep away from any devices with access to the web.",
            "Federal charges can also bring harsher potential sentences. ",
            "The rarely invoked charge of using “a facility of interstate … commerce” to incite a riot carries a maximum penalty of up to five years in prison and fine of as much as $250,000. Most federal defendants get shorter sentences under federal sentencing guidelines.",
            "And a man charged this week with throwing a burning glove under a New York Police Department cruiser, Victor Sanchez-Santa, is facing a five-year mandatory minimum and a total of as much as 20 years in prison if convicted on a federal arson charge. Prosecutors say the matter can be prosecuted in federal court because the NYPD receives federal funds. Others, including two Brooklyn lawyers, face 50-year mandatory minimums if convicted on a slew of federal charges stemming from arson attacks on NYPD cars during recent unrest.",
            "The then-U.S. Attorney in Manhattan, Geoffrey Berman, said in a statement Thursday that arson deserves serious prosecution because it involves serious danger.",
            "“Arson is … a threat to more than its immediate victim, with the potential to destroy and terrify far beyond the place where a fire is set,” Berman said.",

        "title": "How Tulsa’s Republican Mayor Found Himself at the Center of America’s Debate on Race",
        "body": [
            "G.T. Bynum’s faltering efforts on police reform took a hit after George Floyd’s killing. It hasn’t gotten any easier with President Trump coming to town. ",
            "TULSA, Oklahoma—By almost any measure, this has been a terrible month for Tulsa Mayor G. T. Bynum.",
            "Like almost every other city in America, Tulsa was the scene of major protests after the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis sparked major protests. Demonstrators tried to take over an interstate highway and some even marched to Bynum’s house, an act he called “intimidation.” In a city that was the site of the nation’s most notorious massacre of black residents, hundreds of whom were murdered in their homes by a white mob, the mayor’s insinuation that he felt threatened by unarmed protesters didn’t sit well with the black community.",
            "It only got worse. Bynum, a mild-mannered 43-year-old with tortoise-shell glasses, gave an interview on national television that downplayed the role of race in a widely publicized police shooting. No sooner had he apologized for his “dumb and overly simplistic” comment than one of his highest-ranking officers said police should statistically be shooting more black people “based on the crimes committed.”",
            "In the middle of all this, President Donald Trump, whose provocative rhetoric after Floyd’s death inflamed tensions across the country, announced he would come to Tulsa to hold his first rally since the coronavirus pandemic had interrupted his public campaigning. Bynum, a moderate Republican, has stressed he had nothing to do with Trump’s visit, but he resisted repeated calls to cancel the rally at the 19,000-seat BOK Center in downtown. He did not respond to interview requests made to his office. In a public statement, he said that an event in the middle of a spike in Covid-19 cases “isn’t ideal.” ",
            "Now Tulsa, population just under 400,000, is preparing for the arrival of tens of thousands of Trump supporters and counter-protesters. High steel fencing lines streets through downtown, which Bynum placed under curfew starting Thursday night in fear that “organized groups who have been involved in destructive and violent behavior in other States are planning to travel to the City of Tulsa for purposes of causing unrest in and around the rally.” Trump torqued up the tension Friday morning with a tweet threat: “Any protesters, anarchists, agitators, looters or lowlifes who are going to Oklahoma please understand, you will not be treated like you have been in New York, Seattle, or Minneapolis.”",
            "Whatever happens over the coming hours and days is unlikely to make Bynum’s job easier. Even before Floyd’s death spurred the Black Lives Matter movement into overdrive, Bynum found himself in a political vise increasingly familiar to mayors in cities across the conservative heart of the country. He represents a city where Republicans outnumber Democrats by about 2 to 1. But over the course of his four years in office, Bynum has made conscious efforts to reform a police department that arrests black people at twice the rate of white people and that has been condemned for controversial killings of black men. In February, Bynum appointed Tulsa’s first black police chief. ",
            "But like so much in the Bynum administration, the move has failed to resonate with some black voters, who regard Police Chief Wendell Franklin as a police force insider rather than a true agent of change. In recent days, the pace of that change, and Bynum’s commitment to it, has come into question as the mayor has tried to mediate a fraught negotiation about civilian oversight of the police. Almost everyone involved—the police union and Black Lives Matter supporters—have expressed feelings of betrayal by the mayor whom they accuse of flip-flopping on the issue. ",
            "At a Wednesday news conference, Franklin said, “The eyes of the world are upon us now. We are ready.” ",
            "Bynum’s leadership of Tulsa once had a sense of destiny. ",
            "His uncle, grandfather and great-great grandfather all held the same position. Elected in the summer of 2016, Bynum seemed eager to bridge racial divides that have lingered for nearly a century. He declared he wanted “One Tulsa,” and launched a fact-gathering mission to quantify racial disparities in such areas as policing, education and housing, and created the Mayor’s Office of Resilience and Equity to pilot reforms. ",
            "Then, just weeks after he was elected, a white female officer shot and killed Terence Crutcher, an unarmed black man who had stopped his car in the middle of the road. The shooting was captured on video by a circling police helicopter. The officer was charged with manslaughter. There was a flurry of national attention but in the black community the outrage never disappeared. ",
            "Then in 2017, it happened again. Tulsa County deputies shot Joshua Barre, a mentally ill 29-year-old black man who was wandering the street with two knives. Only three weeks before, the officer who shot Crutcher had been acquitted.",
            "Bynum, meanwhile, promoted economic investment in the predominantly black neighborhoods of North Tulsa. And, to address long-standing fear and anger from black residents toward the Tulsa Police Department, Bynum proposed in January 2019 establishing an Office of Independent Monitor to provide oversight, based on a model he admired in Denver.",
            "The mayor also responded to the request of leaders in the black community, such as the Rev. Robert Turner, to create a commission to investigate the whereabouts of mass graves from the 1921 massacre and placed the pastor on the commission. City officials and community leaders hoped bodies could be exhumed and given a proper burial for the centennial anniversary next year.",
            "“I think the mayor has done a good job of engaging that, more so than any mayor I can remember in Tulsa,” said Corbin Brewster, the chief public defender of Tulsa County. “Then you have Trump announce he’s going to have a rally. ... That just magnifies all those fissures and second guessing and pressure on our city officials.”",
            "But others feel the problems are self-inflicted. The Office of Independent Monitor stalled after pressure from the police union and disagreement over details among City Council and activists.",
            "And Turner nearly quit the committee charged with overseeing the survey and excavation of mass graves from the massacre because of how slowly the city was moving and how narrowly it conducted its search. The work is now on pause indefinitely as a result of the pandemic, even though the state has largely opened up. ",
            "But the days after the George Floyd killing have been especially challenging for Bynum, who has seemed to pinball between defensiveness and stubborn insistence on “law and order.”",
            "Not long after he complained of “intimidation” by activists, Bynum appeared on a conservative talk radio show on June 1. He continued his criticism while defending law enforcement. Within the day, however, he met with the activists, including Turner, and agreed to a number of their demands, such as ending LivePD in Tulsa, a reality law-enforcement show featuring local cops on the beat. He agreed to meet with the Crutcher family, who had filed a civil lawsuit against the city, and to renew his push for the Office of Independent Monitor.",
            "Conservatives accused him of flip-flopping. Jerad Lindsey, chairman of the Tulsa Fraternal Order of Police, described himself as “completely blindsided.” He added that the mayor owed the police officers of Tulsa an explanation. ",
            "Meanwhile, public relations disasters kept exploding around Bynum. ",
            "On June 8, Maj. Travis Yates of the Tulsa Police Department, made national headlines with his remark on local talk radio that police were “shooting African Americans about 24 percent less than we ought to be, based on the crimes being committed.” The mayor condemned the comments, but Yates kept his job, pending an internal investigation. Shortly thereafter, Tulsa police made national news again, this time with a video of police officers roughly arresting black teenagers for walking in a street. ",
            "In the midst of this, Bynum appeared on “CBS Sunday Morning” in a segment about the historical racial strife in Tulsa, saying that it was drug use rather than race that played a factor in the killing of Terence Crutcher. “After meeting with the mayor and thinking we were moving in the right direction, we hear him make those egregious comments,” said Tiffany Crutcher, the twin sister of Terence who has risen to prominence in Tulsa as an activist after creating the Terence Crutcher Foundation to advocate for civil rights. “I was nauseated.”",
            "Bynum apologized. “When your friends start calling you and repeatedly use the phrase ‘I know your heart’, it is a good indicator you’ve screwed up,” he wrote on Twitter. But the damage was done. ",
            "Within days, Tiffany Crutcher recruited a board member of her foundation, Greg Robinson, to run for office against Bynum in August, bringing the total challengers to seven. “This is part of our three-year push for change,” Crutcher said. “We just felt we needed to take it to the next level.” Crutcher is his campaign manager. ",
            "Meanwhile, the Fraternal Order of Police isn’t forgetting Bynum’s remarks, either. ",
            "Lindsey told me the mayor has “not yet” but is close to losing support of the police. “We are giving him a lot of latitude because Tulsa is a unique place and this is a unique time in history.” Still, the police union opposes his proposal for the Office of Independent Monitor, arguing that it will result in less policing, not better policing. Lindsey said the cops in Denver told him they work in fear of residents reporting them to the city’s OIM for doing their jobs. “What is the easiest way to not get a complaint?” he asks. “Not to engage. You have guys sitting in parking lots; they don’t drive neighborhoods.” ",
            "A five-minute drive in Tulsa can take you from the growing camp of defiant Trump supporters at the BOK Center to a place that feels both far away and uncomfortably close: the Vernon Chapel A.M.E. Church, which was burned in the 1921 Black Wall Street massacre that killed some 300 black Tulsans. ",
            "The church was soon rebuilt, but it now needs millions in repairs it can’t afford. Annual revenue is $200,000 per year, and the congregation is elderly and few—just 135 worshippers. “I know churches with Sunday School classes larger than our whole membership,” Pastor Turner told me this week. “But God chose us to be his vessel.” ",
            "Turner, 37, keeps a bullhorn and a sign at his desk that reads in all caps: REPARATIONS NOW. He has led the fight to identify and excavate the mass graves of victims of the Tulsa race massacre and secure compensation for their descendants, many of whom make up his congregation. ",
            "His church is responding to Trump’s presence by hosting two rallies: one on Friday, the anniversary of Juneteenth, the celebration of the symbolic end of chattel slavery in 1865, and the other one opposite the president’s rally on Saturday evening. Raising the profile of the event, is the Rev. Al Sharpton, who is flying in to deliver an address Friday night. Meanwhile, the Trump campaign is claiming so much enthusiasm that it has rented a second venue near the BOK Center for an overflow crowd. ",
            "“Unless he has changed his political strategy, I’m concerned that [Trump] is going to charge them up,” said Turner. “His last campaign was very high on vitriol and bombast. So you get filled with that for however long he’s going to speak, and God knows what those folks are going to want to do.”",
            "The National Guard has been activated, but Turner is worried enough that he is not counting on them or local police alone to keep the peace. So he has hired private security for his rally. “As a Christian, I do not worry,” Turner says. “As a human being, I have concerns. I just pray to God to protect us. I know he can. I pray he will.”",
            "CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story misstated the anniversary of the Juneteenth celebration."

The court dismissed a lawsuit filed earlier this week that argued social distancing and mask wearing should be required at the rally.",

            "Bynum noted that protests have already “been planned in response to” Trump’s rally, and black community leaders have expressed fears about episodes of violence resulting from the campaign event — which overlaps with a two-day local celebration of Juneteenth, a holiday commemorating the end of slavery in the United States.",
            "The rally was initially scheduled to take place Friday on Juneteenth, but Trump last week announced it would instead be held Saturday after facing significant criticism for the initial choice of date. ",

            "Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale played down concerns of a confrontation. “I’ve been here since Day One, and I found all Trump supporters to be really caring, loving people that care about this country,” he told Fox News.",
            "Parscale also claimed, however, the campaign was aware of “people coming in that are trying to disrupt” and “trying to create scenes” at Saturday’s rally. The protesters, he argued, “want that moment where CNN or some other fake news media can try to make it look like a Trump supporter is not a loving and caring person.”",
            "Lara Trump, a senior adviser to the Trump campaign and the president’s daughter-in-law, similarly insisted that “Trump supporters are, by and large, very peaceful people.” But she nevertheless lamented that “anybody would ever consider doing this just to cause chaos and destruction and violence.” ",
            "“I just think it’s such a shame that anyone would hijack anything,” she told Fox News. “You saw how these agitators hijacked the peaceful protest, and they turned them into riots and into burning down buildings and destroying small businesses, and it devolved into violence very quickly.” ",
            "Later Friday morning, the president’s focus appeared to shift away from potential conflict as he returned to his frequent fixation on his rallies’ attendance levels. ",
            "“Big crowds and lines already forming in Tulsa. My campaign hasn’t started yet. It starts on Saturday night in Oklahoma!” Trump tweeted — even though his campaign billed a June 2019 event in Orlando as its official 2020 kickoff.",
            "Still, the repeated references by the president and his top political aides to the possibility of a clash on the streets of Tulsa ratcheted up anxieties related to Saturday’s rally — Trump’s first since the end of widespread coronavirus lockdown orders.",
            "Oklahoma reported 450 new COVID-19 cases Thursday, a record for the state, and public health officials have warned attendees are at a heightened risk of contracting the disease in densely packed convention centers.",
            "Organizers will provide temperature checks, masks and hand sanitizer before the event to rallygoers, who are required to pledge not to sue the Trump campaign should they become infected."

        "body": [
            "City budget fights pit activists against Democratic politicians.",
            "The liberal push to \"defund the police\" has drawn predictable scorn from conservatives and resistance from more moderate Democrats, including the party’s presumptive presidential nominee, Joe Biden. ",
            "But there’s a more significant obstacle to the growing movement on the left: Democratic politicians in the country’s deep-blue cities. ",
            "Many of the cities with the highest number of law enforcement per capita on the payroll are urban areas with progressive mayors — including many women and people of color — and Democratic majorities on the city council. That means local leaders in cities like Washington, New York and Atlanta have the power to limit funding for some of the nation’s largest police forces and reallocate that money for programs to shrink the wealth gap and provide stable housing, access to jobs and health care.",
            "But even in those liberal bastions, the movement is running into resistance.",
            "“These are very blue places, yet we’re still seeing this kind of dynamic with police spending skyrocketing and cuts to community resources and community-led programs,” said Kumar Rao, director of justice transformation at the Center for Popular Democracy, a liberal Brooklyn-based advocacy group. “This is a political issue on one level, but it’s actually very much a bipartisan problem.”",
            "In the nation’s capital, Mayor Muriel Bowser had “BLACK LIVES MATTER” painted on the street leading to the White House after federal officers forcibly cleared out protesters with tear gas and rubber bullets to make way for a presidential photo op outside a historic church. A day later, Black Lives Matter activists painted “DEFUND THE POLICE” next to the original message.",
            "Bowser, however, has proposed a 3.3 percent increase, to $578 million, in police spending in the city's fiscal year 2021 budget. She told NPR last week that she was “not at all” reconsidering her position.",
            "“We fund the police at the level that we need it funded,” she said.",
            "That stance is at odds, however, with the city council, which has been inundated by the public outcry for police reform. Dozens of public witnesses testified at a six-hour virtual Metropolitan Police Department budget oversight hearing Monday in opposition to increased police spending.",
            "More than 500 had people signed up to testify, and members of the public submitted more than 15,000 written, video and phone submissions, the local news site DCist reported, noting that the list of speakers was cut off due to time constraints. In contrast, only 22 people spoke at last year’s police budget hearing. ",
            "“The theme was clear in the testimony, which was a call to evaluate the budget of the Metropolitan Police Department, make appropriate cuts and redirect the funding to meet the needs of residents that have suffered from over-policing and other government disinvestment,” said Kenyan McDuffie, a member of the D.C. Council and chair pro tempore.",
            "In a phone interview, McDuffie told POLITICO the council has been responsive to the public’s suggestions and is “likely” to cut the police department’s budget to reinvest in the community’s priorities, despite Bowser’s opposition. He noted that the council unanimously passed a series of police reforms last week but warned that police reform is only one step in dismantling systemic racism and structural inequities.",
            "The budget process is continuing to play out in D.C., with budget markups set for next week. The full council is scheduled to hold its first vote on the budget on July 7, and the final vote is expected July 28.",
            "The District is just one of dozens of cities from the East Coast to the West Coast grappling with the message behind the “defund police” motto. To critics, it’s a literal call to bankrupt and abolish police departments. But to many leaders, it’s a call to reform policing; rethink when, where and how police should be deployed; cut police budgets; and invest more money in communities, instead of in policing communities.",
            "\"You ask people what does defunding the police mean — you ask three people, you’ll get three different opinions,\" Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti told California Playbook in a virtual interview Tuesday. “But I think what is crystal clear to all of us is that we are underfunding black communities — whether it’s economic development, whether it’s education, whether it’s health — and other communities of color.”",
            "Garcetti said he supported a reevaluation of police funding but did not embrace calls to fully defund or dismantle police departments.",
            "Rashad Robinson, executive director of the racial justice organization Color of Change, noted that activists across the country are seeing a movement of cities beginning to examine their budgets more closely amid calls to defund police.",
            "“Budgets are moral documents, right? They say what our values are,” he said. “Beyond any rhetoric, beyond words, they tell the story of what we actually hope to achieve by what we put money in, and far too often, when we have problems in our society, we seek to solve them with people with guns.”",
            "Hundreds of residents and activists have flooded virtual council meetings in city after city with calls to defund and reform police departments. According to a POLITICO analysis of city budgets, crime statistics and census data, there’s no direct correlation between police spending and crime. ",
            "The grassroots energy overwhelming city councils comes in the wake of George Floyd’s killing at the hands of a white Minneapolis police officer on May 25. Floyd’s death led to global protests against police brutality and racism, and “defund the police” — an idea decades in the making — became a rallying cry. ",
            "Minneapolis’ city council has since unanimously passed a resolution to disband its police department and replace it after a year of research and community engagement. But Mayor Jacob Frey and Police Chief Medaria Arradondo want to reform the department rather than dismantle it.",
            "In New York, Mayor Bill de Blasio earlier this month pledged to cut the police department’s funding. De Blasio failed to specify how much he would curb spending, but the city council is eying a cut of nearly 20 percent after calling for a 7 percent reduction weeks earlier. The council has a July 1 deadline to pass a budget.",
            "Atlanta’s city council has a special meeting to adopt its budget Friday, a week after 27-year-old Rayshard Brooks was fatally shot by police outside a Wendy’s drive-thru. Monday’s nearly 12-hour council meeting included the playing of nearly 500 public comments that were submitted. ",
            "The council approved two resolutions urging the city and the state Legislature to adopt policies implementing comprehensive police reform and calling for a report of recommendations for the city’s approach to public safety, including systematic changes to policies and reinventing the culture of policing, to be submitted by Dec. 1.",
            "Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, a contender to become Biden’s running mate who signed an order this week to reform the police department’s use of force, has said Atlanta is ahead of the curve because it’s already in the process of reallocating public safety funds. ",
            "But the city council is poised to add about $12 million to the police department’s budget when it votes Friday, according to Felicia Moore, the council’s president. Moore told POLITICO that city officials had pledged last year to increase police spending for four years following a study by the Atlanta Police Foundation that found Atlanta officers were paid well below the median rates. ",
            "“I can’t speak for what their votes will be, but I would tend to think that reneging on a promise to keep our salaries competitive would be something that they wouldn’t want to do,” Moore said. ",
            "“All the money’s not gonna be spent on the day that we adopt a budget,” she added. “They may go back and revisit the budget and make some adjustments. I just think the issue came up in a time frame that doesn’t give the council a full opportunity to make the decision” to defund the police department right now."

        "body": [
            "The withdrawal reflected her trademark pragmatism and Democrats' belief that the ticket needs a racial balance.",
            "Sen. Amy Klobuchar late Thursday said she personally called presumptive Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden to advise he pick a woman of color as his running mate, effectively announcing the end of her vice presidential aspirations.",
            "\"I truly believe, as I actually told the vice president last night when I called him, that I think this is a moment to put a woman of color on that ticket,\" the Minnesota Democrat told MSNBC's Lawrence O'Donnell. \"And there is so many incredibly qualified women.\"",
            "Klobuchar had long been considered a top contender for Biden's vice presidential pick, but as protests over police brutality against African Americans erupted across the country following the death of George Floyd at the hands of a Minneapolis police officer, the traditional running mate calculus was altered. Klobuchar's credentials as a former prosecutor with a tough-on-crime record didn't sit well as her home state became a locus among protests and calls for structural change in law enforcement.",
            "Two other potential Biden picks, California Sen. Kamala Harris and Florida Rep. Val Demings, also have law enforcement backgrounds. However, both are black women, have more support among African American leaders and have been more comfortable discussing issues of race, inequality and police brutality.",
            "In adding her name to the growing chorus of voices who think Biden should not pick a white woman, Klobuchar’s announcement was widely viewed by Democratic insiders as a blow to the chances of Massachusetts’ Sen Elizabeth Warren, who is a top consideration for Biden. ",
            "Biden, who has not committed to picking a running mate based on race, region or ideology, has said he plans to make his decision by early August.",
            "After Klobuchar's announcement, Biden tweeted: \"Amy — from the moment you announced you were running for president in a snowstorm, it wasn't hard to see you had the grit and determination to do anything you set your mind to. You know how to get things done. With your help, we’re going to beat Donald Trump.\"",
            "Klobuchar’s withdrawal reflected her trademark pragmatism, and her statement that Biden should pick a woman of color spoke to the growing belief by Democrats, including the candidate’s allies, that his ticket needs a racial balance. That sentiment only intensified after Floyd's killing at the end of May.",
            "A POLITICO/Morning Consult poll release last week showed that found 46 percent of Democrats said it's important Biden pick a nonwhite vice presidential candidate, an increase of 10 percentage points since early April.",
            "Klobuchar had unique challenges with voters of color during her primary bid. She did little to attract black and Latino voters and she was latterly viewed with suspicion by activists against police brutality because she was a former prosecutor in Minneapolis, the city where Floyd was killed.",
            "Klobuchar’s decision to step back was immediately praised on Twitter by two of Biden’s advisers.",
            "“@amyklobuchar just withdrew from VP consideration with such grace; seizing this historical moment to commit her leadership to helping her state of Minnesota heal,” wrote adviser Karine Jean-Pierre.",
            "Biden adviser Symone Sanders praised Klobuchar’s “introspection, your passion & your insight.”",
            "Klobuchar on Thursday said she would focus on helping her home state heal after weeks of unrest and police violence directed at protesters, and cited her position on the Senate Judiciary Committee as a way forward for creating meaningful police reform.",
            "When asked by O'Donnell whether she thought the discussions of race and police brutality would remain front and center of the presidential race going forward, Klobuchar responded \"of course it will be.\"",
            "Still, Klobuchar maintained that her career in law enforcement would not have hindered her ability to run and serve well as vice president.",
            "\"I could have functioned fine and there is a lot of untruths out there about my record,\" Klobuchar said. \"And now is not the time to debate those. Some things that have been put out on there through the internet. That's just what life is in politics.\"",

        "title": "The Unhappy Liberals Inside Trump’s Favorite Network ",
        "body": [
            "One America News employees say a majority of the reporters at its San Diego headquarters are liberals—and they’re chafing at their own network’s coverage of national protests and the coronavirus. ",
            "As protests and riots roiled the nation in early June, a missive from the news director at President Donald Trump’s favorite network arrived in the inboxes of anchors, delivering marching orders. ",
            "“I want to get everyone on the same page regarding coverage of ongoing protests and riots/looting,” Chris Schickedanz, the news director at One America News headquartered in San Diego, wrote to anchors. Among his suggestions for possible storylines: “organized riots/looting/Antifa’s actions,” as well as the “president’s response” and “justifications for deployments if local officials are unable to control.” Anchors should focus on small businesses and family owned “shops being destroyed,” “peaceful black protesters protecting white police officers” and the “black community speaking out against violence.” And, he noted, his reporters should “beware” of “narratives being pushed by mainstream media.” ",
            "“We will continue to cover any violence live tonight from the studio,” Schickedanz concluded in the memo, screenshots of which an OAN anchor provided to me and were confirmed by other recipients. He added: “We want everyone working together on this and want everyone to understand our coverage plans.”",
            "One OAN anchor who read the message came away frustrated. The note, this anchor told me, had omitted a major part of the unfolding story that’s sweeping the nation during this turbulent American spring: Police brutality in response to peaceful protesters—a subject the cable network’s owners had a history of eliding in their coverage, beginning with civil unrest in Ferguson, Missouri, in 2014. ",
            "“It doesn’t explicitly say not to cover police brutality, but it’s not included in the email,” said this anchor, who asked for anonymity in fear of retribution from the network’s owners. “It discourages us from striving for objectivity when covering these protests—when there’s obviously been violence on both sides.”",
            "It might be surprising that such sentiment exists in the newsroom at OAN, known as more loyal to the president than even Fox News. Founded and run by tech-business tycoon Robert Herring and his family, known as editorially tight-gripped, hands-on owners, it broadcasts to some 70 markets across the country, carrying every last minute of Trump rallies. It touts any silver lining in reelection polls for the president. And its chief White House correspondent, Chanel Rion, routinely serves up softballs for Trump during briefings. ",
            "But according to four current OAN employees, including three anchors, and two former OAN producers, most of the journalists they know at the network’s headquarters consider themselves liberal. For some, taking a job at the national network was a way to leapfrog small regional broadcast jobs—a Faustian bargain they say leads to high turnover in the newsroom.",
            "“I’ve worked on every shift now (morning, afternoon and & overnight) and can objectively say there is only one or two hardcore conservatives” in the newsroom, said one anchor via text. (The anchor’s analysis didn’t include evening opinion hosts.) ",
            "This dynamic is, according to several of the employees I spoke to, leading to tensions inside the newsroom as OAN makes headlines for its controversial coverage of coronavirus and the anti-racist protests. They said that in recent weeks they have felt everything from “horrified” to “defeated” at their own network’s reporting on the protests and are concerned that the management is pushing them toward increasingly conservative coverage angles. These employees said they feel pressured to cover angles that will protect network founder and CEO Robert Herring’s business investments. ",
            "In recent years, Herring has become more and more concerned about the ideological leanings of his employees, according to Chris Pocock, a newswriter and producer who worked at the network for four years, beginning in 2015 and ending last March. At the same time, Herring, known by his employees as “Mr. H,” has also become more involved in the coverage. ",
            "“People with left-leaning beliefs were treated with suspicion by Mr. H—though with some exceptions, hardly anyone in the newsroom agreed with the direction the newscast had taken,” Pocock, who left because he was frustrated with the network’s one-sided coverage, told me in his first-ever on-the-record interview about his time at OAN. ",
            "A current network anchor told me that Herring and his son Bobby once made a list of newsroom employees and their assumed political leanings (liberal or conservative), with photos appearing next to names. The Herrings then interrogated each employee on the list as to whether that political affiliation was correct, according to that anchor, who was one of the people questioned. (Pocock said he heard about the list but was not questioned.)",
            "OAN didn’t directly address questions about that interrogation. After answering several questions about the network’s relationship to Trump, the network’s future and its coverage, OAN President Charles Herring, Robert’s son, and OAN spokeswoman Krista McClelland stopped responding to my queries. “It’s complete FALSE garbage, not worthy of legitimate reporting,” McClelland wrote me in response to several questions I asked her, but she would not clarify to which claim she was referring. ",
            "McClelland also declined to provide a breakdown of the network’s total number of employees, or the number of employees at its San Diego headquarters, or New York or D.C. bureaus: “We don’t believe that other businesses would provide such information,” she said. The employees I spoke to estimate that they have about 30 newsroom colleagues in San Diego—that is where the network’s owners are based, too—and said that the New York and D.C. bureaus are much smaller. OAN did not make reporters available from the New York or D.C. bureaus. None of the six OAN employees based in New York and D.C. I contacted returned messages seeking comment. Six other San Diego employees I contacted didn’t return my messages; a seventh declined an interview. ",
            "When I spent more than 14 hours watching OAN’s coronavirus coverage in May, I found that much of the content was pretty much straight down the middle—for example, an interview with former Veterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin about how the coronavirus was affecting vets—a source you might not expect, given his ouster by Trump—or dispatches on hydroxychloroquine that mention the drug isn’t approved by the Food and Drug Administration. And much of it is actually straightforward syndicated news: Throughout the day, the network runs packages from Reuters and The Associated Press. The employees I spoke to say they and their fellow progressives in San Diego are the people who read, write and produce this coverage.",
            "These reports, however, are dwarfed in attention by a smaller percentage of coverage at the network that is flagrantly pro-Trump and often veers into conspiracy territory: partisan dispatches from reporters such as Rion and the correspondent Jack Posobiec—both of whom work in the D.C. bureau—not to mention nightly opinion shows helmed by commentators like Graham Ledger and Liz Wheeler, both based in San Diego. ",
            "The friction this situation creates was suddenly on display earlier this month. On Friday, June 5, a few days after the email from Schickedanz arrived in his inbox, the anchor was surprised when the network ran a package on Martin Gugino, the 75-year-old Buffalo man who was shoved by police officers and fell backward hitting his head on the concrete, blood pooling around his right ear. “TWO ‘NEW YORK STATE’ POLICE OFFICERS ARE SUSPENDED FOLLOWING AN INCIDENT THAT PUT A 75-YEAR-OLD MAN IN SERIOUS CONDITION,” read a script I obtained from a newsroom employee. ",
            "An OAN anchor I spoke with believed that story had run because it hadn’t been seen by higher-ups at the network. The writer of that segment, said the anchor, drafted the script at 2 a.m. early Friday, “so there weren’t any bosses around besides the other producers.” The anchor didn’t know the writer’s identity, but could see the script was written during a 2 a.m. shift. ",
            "By Sunday, OAN was reporting a far different version of the story. In this one, Kristian Rouz, a Russian reporter who reports for OAN and Russian propaganda site Sputnik, called Gugino an “ANTIFA provocateur” who was interfering with police work. It was a baseless theory. But on Tuesday morning, Trump, an avid watcher of OAN, glommed on to the conspiracy and tweeted about it. (OAN has previously said Rouz’s work for Sputnik is unrelated to his work at OAN. Rouz did not respond to a request for comment.)",
            "“When I saw the story I immediately thought, ‘this is wrong,’” an OAN anchor said of the network’s smear of Gugino. “No matter what he may have been doing, he didn’t deserve what happened to him. Why speculate when the man isn’t even in a position to defend himself after getting his skull cracked open? It’s just in poor taste.”",
            "Robert Herring seemed to double down on the conspiracy theory later in the morning, in response to criticism, tweeting: “Follow-up reporting coming later today on @OANN ! We have information to challenge those who are questioning the facts.” ",
            "Unearthing even the most quotidian facts about OAN is a heavy lift. The network’s press kit is a two-page PDF with fewer than 300 words of copy. The nearly 7-year-old network doesn’t subscribe to Nielsen Media Research, so industry-standard viewership numbers aren’t available. ",
            "But OAN’s fealty to the president has boosted the network as a reliable bit player in the Trump-era conservative mediasphere, ensconced among right-wing talk radio, Fox News and Sinclair Broadcasting. According to third-party set-top box data, OAN today is available in more than 35 million homes each night, giving it about a third of Fox News’ reach. The only audience data I could find were from last spring, when Nielsen briefly measured OAN’s ratings in the country’s biggest metro areas. During that time period, OAN averaged 14,000 total viewers while Fox News averaged 631,000 viewers. ",
            "But OAN is growing in influence—its ratings are up by about 55 percent from a year ago, according to Charles Herring. In January, the Wall Street Journal reported that Hicks Equity Partners, a company connected to Republican National Committee co-Chair Thomas Hicks Jr., was spearheading a potential buyout of the network alongside GOP donors—a future vehicle for Trump following his presidency. ",
            "Long before Chanel Rion lectured what she has called the fake news media or dished out interrogatory alley-oops to Trump during White House news conferences, OAN’s very founding came at a partisan event. At the 2013 Conservative Political Action Conference in March, Ledger walked to the podium to unveil the new network. Prior to his engagement with OAN, Ledger worked as an anchor covering hard-news headlines on another Herring Networks channel called A Wealth of Entertainment, formerly Wealth TV. ",
            "“Like Fruit of the Loom, I will be brief,” he said back in 2013 at CPAC to groans. He had a couple of questions for the audience. ",
            "“Do you approve of a mainstream liberal media that covers for the mistakes of this president?\" ",
            "“No,” they shouted. ",
            "“Do you approve of a mainstream liberal media that won’t cover Fast and Furious?” He said, referring to the Obama-era gun-running investigation. ",
            "“No,” they yelled.",
            "“And do you approve of a liberal media that distorts and lies about the record of Ronald Reagan?” ",
            "“No,” they shot back. ",
            "“Well, I’m as frustrated as you, but you know what? I have a solution. Yes, there is a solution. It’s One America. This is going to be your network.” ",
            "A few months later, on July 4, OAN flickered to life. ",
            "From the beginning, the network aimed to become the C-SPAN of cable newsers: No talking heads, aside from a few opinion shows, and news delivered 21-hours a day from a studio. And from 2013 to Trump’s presidential campaign, the network largely toiled in obscurity. When Pocock arrived in 2015, just before the Republican primaries, he was happy to land a job at one of San Diego’s two TV news stations (the area is also home to KUSI, an independent station owned by McKinnon Broadcasting). Back then, he didn’t get the impression OAN was conservative from the job posting or his interview. “The coverage then was much more down the middle and left mostly to producers,” Pocock told me. “And as far as I can remember, there were no rules yet dictating coverage and what stories to avoid. Writers and producers were generally enthusiastic because it really was a great opportunity for people right out of college.”",
            "Over time, Pocock said, founder and owner Robert Herring became more involved in the newscast. As Trump ran for president, the network became known for covering his rallies and quashing negative stories about the then-candidate. When Mitt Romney gave a blistering March 2016 speech about Trump, for example, Herring told his journalists: “Do not carry the Romney speech live,” according to a 2017 report from the Washington Post. ",
            "“OAN’s focus, namely providing a credible source of national and international news, hasn’t changed since its launch on July 4, 2013,” Charles Herring told me in an email. ",
            "In August 2015, when Trump said Fox News debate moderator Megyn Kelly “had blood coming out of her eyes” and “blood coming out of her wherever” after she questioned him, Pocock said Robert Herring assigned him the story. “Mr. H got mad that I said Trump ‘attacked Megyn Kelly,’ suggesting that was an unfair representation because ‘she had gone after him during that debate’ and therefore wasn’t a victim,” Pocock recalled.",
            "Pocock told me other dictates soon popped up. “We were told through our executive producer to avoid stories slamming Russia (because H’s wife was from Russia, not [because of] election interference), stories about unarmed black people being killed by police, and negative stories about Trump or Tesla—because Mr. H. owned stock and several Tesla cars, and was worried that negative press from OAN would bring down its value,” Pocock said. A current anchor also recalled hearing the network was not to cover Tesla negatively because Herring owned stock and a Tesla, which Herring drives to work. Another current OAN employee didn’t know whether Herring owned Tesla stock, but also learned during training that “Tesla is on our list of ‘pro’ coverage topics.”",
            "Morale at the station began to sink, Pocock remembers. Those who stayed became close. “There was a sense that we were in the trenches together, trying to make conservative-leaning though factual news coverage,” he said. “Most employees thought the idea behind OAN was great—constantly refreshing programming purely focused on the news of the day, something like a Twitter news feed on your TV, during a time that CNN, FOX and MSNBC were pivoting to roundtables and talking heads—but that it was horribly mismanaged.” ",
            "For example, Pocock said the network required three sources to support a story, but that rule became inconsistently applied. “Conservative stories would pass muster with two sources, while much higher standards would be applied to left-leaning ones,” Pocock recalls. Pocock said he was once reprimanded by Herring after suggesting InfoWars, a radio show and website widely recognized as peddling false conspiracy theories, wasn’t an accurate source. He said he was told to keep his “liberal beliefs at the door.” When he returned from the meeting with Herring, co-workers were surprised to see him: They told him they thought he would be fired. ",
            "The four employees I spoke to who are currently at OAN say that unlike Pocock, they knew they were joining a network with a reputation for being Trumpian when they were hired. For the three anchors, working for OAN was a way to skip the traditional broadcast journalism path of toiling away for a local affiliate for years before getting a national audience. ",
            "“It’s a little bit harder to break into those markets since they’re a little bit more established, and they have their own affiliates throughout the country,” said Alex Salvi, who hosts the 10 p.m. slot “After Hours with Alex Salvi.” “So I saw an opportunity there that I thought I should capitalize on.” ",
            "In part, the ideological bent of the San Diego newsroom is due to age and political geography. “Because the headquarters is in San Diego, all the employees tend to be a lot more progressive,” said Salvi, who added that the newsroom skews quite young. Salvi, a 28-year-old with a law degree from Valparaiso University Law School and a graduate journalism degree from the University of Southern California, occupies a role as OAN’s Brian Stelter, covering the nexus of politics and media. “There are your hardcore conservatives, but it’s safe to assume that the majority of us are all pretty liberal.” ",
            "Salvi confided in me that while at Valparaiso, he crafted several blogs as the editor-in-chief of the school’s law blog that were critical of then-Indiana Gov. Mike Pence’s response to the Scott County HIV outbreak. He interned for Democratic Illinois Rep. Mike Quigley in Chicago. On a recent weekend off, he returned to Chicago to follow the protests there, though didn’t use his reporting on the network. ",
            "And Salvi’s on-air coverage isn’t exclusively focused on toeing the party line and minimizing the novel coronavirus. He has debated Liz Wheeler, the conservative millennial firebrand who helms “Tipping Point” during the 9 p.m. hour, about the effectiveness of lockdown measures (he argued social distancing has been effective) and their differing coronavirus coverage. Salvi also has criticized Sean Hannity’s coronavirus coverage.",
            "Salvi has a liberal background, but he doesn’t criticize OAN, which is perhaps why the network has fashioned Salvi into something of a spokesperson, an emissary to traditional media organizations such as CNN, where he has appeared on Stelter’s “Reliable Sources” to defend the channel. When I asked the network to interview an OAN personality for this story, it was Salvi who gave me a call. Rion’s obsequious questioning at the White House? “She is speaking about a lot of the questions that we’ve heard that a lot of our viewers want to hear covered,” Salvi told me, though he conceded he would word some of her questions in the briefing room differently. ",
            "When I asked him whether he felt concerned about his career prospects after OAN—if others in the broader journalism community might peg him as talent on the president’s favorite network—he demurred. “One American News has never had a sit-down interview with President Trump, the same way that CNN has never had a sit-down interview with President Trump, and that’s not something that I think a lot of people would suspect to hear when they hear about ‘the President’s favorite network,’” he said. “They think that we constantly have access to them and are sitting down with them all the time and having in-depth interviews but I don’t think that’s the case. … President Trump is giving credit to us for our coverage, but I think then that this is used to not only weaponize against him, but also weaponized against us.”",
            "When I asked network president Charles Herring about the network’s relationship with the president—Herring contacted me directly after I filled out the site’s “contact us” form—he told me that Trump has been watching the network since before his 2015 presidential bid. They met in early 2015, when Trump told Herring he was a fan of the network. Trump watched OAN in his New York residence, Herring said, through his Verizon FiOS TV bundle.",
            "As for the coverage that seemed to favor Republican bookings, Herring wrote in an email that “OAN interviews and features leading Democrat newsmakers on a regular basis. OAN would like to interview presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden.” (He cited no examples of recent Democrats interviewed.)",
            "Watching OAN, it’s easy to see the symbiotic relationship between the president and the network. The network earns Trump’s attention with its doting coverage. When Trump gives it to OAN—in a tweet that returns the favor, for example—it is often in the context of goading Fox to follow suit. “I think that the president does use us a little bit as a leverage against Fox News at times where he’s not happy with their coverage,” Salvi said. ",
            "Robert Herring seems to embrace this competitive dynamic. “Mr. President, why are you still watching Fox News?” Herring tweeted this week. He also teased a poll “in favor” of the president (conducted by OAN) on Twitter, after news broke that Trump issued a cease-and-desist letter to CNN for its polling that found Trump underwater. But in that promised report, Rouz omitted the poll’s findings that were bad for the president, according to the Washington Post, and the network eventually scrubbed it from its website. ",
            "“The president supports it because it blindly promotes him,” one former OAN producer said, “and it blindly supports the president because that’s what makes it money and gives it unique viewership.” ",
            "The three other current OAN employees I spoke to, all of whom declined to be named, were much less sanguine than Salvi. They have always known a portion of the network’s journalism was overwhelmingly pro-Trump, but soldiered on, swapping gripes over drinks at the bar. During Covid and nationwide protests, though, that frustration has given way to group texts about their growing problems with the network’s coverage, which they believe has become more conspiracy-laden and lopsided. It doesn’t help that mainstream outlets have been covering every misstep.",
            "“Once [our coronavirus coverage] started getting criticized by CNN and other outlets,” one anchor said “we all kind of just started to feel down about working here because it made us feel like all the work we were personally doing didn’t matter because all the attention on that started to drown out everything else.” This anchor was referring to Rouz’s now-deleted May 7 segment in which the coronavirus was depicted as a population control effort by China and George Soros. OAN pulled the segment after CNN and other outlets panned it.",
            "Then came George Floyd’s death, and the riots and protests that followed. The memo on how to cover the unrest was unusually heavy-handed, the anchor told me. “We do sometimes get certain emails about certain stories we don’t want to cover, but they’re never really about pushing out a certain narrative—this was the first one in that regard,” this person said. ",
            "“We could obviously be more critical of the administration’s handling of (the protests and coronavirus) and it’s not so much that we’re praising his approach, we’re just leaving that aspect alone a little bit,” another anchor told me.",
            "Another said journalists there live in fear of getting a story pulled or reprimanded by “Mr. H.” “We could be doing more, but our producers are working with what they have and are allowed to do. … We can’t push too far without fearing our boss will tell us to pull a story.” ",
            "The employees told me they shake their heads at what they consider the network’s out-of-touch and hagiographic segments. On the 12th day of protests, OAN aired a special 30-minute “investigative” report called “Trump: A History of Equality, Diversity and Inclusion,” hosted by Richard Pollock and a group called Black Millennials Supporting Trump. The report featured Trump’s work on criminal justice reform and a segment about how he gave singer/actress Jennifer Hudson an apartment in Trump International Hotel Chicago when members of her family were murdered in 2008; it pointed out that Trump once helped Jesse Jackson secure office space for his Rainbow/PUSH Coalition. Not mentioned is the fact that 74 percent of nonwhite voters disapprove of the president. Nor was Trump’s record on demanding to see the first black president’s birth certificate or his refusal to apologize to the Central Park Five, who were exonerated of assaulting a jogger in 1989. ",
            "“Leave it to OAN,” an anchor texted me after learning of the documentary.",
            "As much as Robert Herring appears to police OAN’s coverage, though, one anchor said he also takes advantage of the presence of liberals at his network to some degree. “We do kind of secretly have a fear of being retaliated against for being liberal, but Mr. H typically [and in private] uses the argument that having liberal employees means that the news isn’t biased—despite the fact we’re not supposed to really run anything pro-liberal/Democrat,” the anchor said. ",
            "Soon, however, Herring may see an exodus of the kind of reporters that give him plausible deniability—and that keep his network moving. ",
            "Two anchors told me employees were dusting off their broadcast reels and polishing their cover letters. ",
            "During a pandemic, others don’t see an exit strategy. “For most of us, we are choosing between our journalistic integrity and whether or not we pay the rent,” says a current OAN employee. “Ultimately, the guy who signs your paycheck calls the shots.”"

        "body": [
            "The chasm between how conservatives and progressives view the protester-occupied area shows how far apart the two sides have drifted — often at Trump's prodding.",
            "In less than two weeks, six blocks in Seattle have come to reflect the divisive American political landscape. ",
            "President Donald Trump has tweeted angrily about the “Domestic Terrorists” and “Radical Left Democrats” occupying Seattle’s so-called Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone, or CHAZ — an area protesters have taken over after police withdrew on June 7. Fox News has portrayed it as a “city under siege” by antifa forces, even offering misleading evidence, such as digitally altered photos. These descriptors have spurred members of far-right groups such as the Proud Boys and Patriot Prayer to descend, claiming they are attempting to root out alleged antifa agents and insurrectionists that don’t actually appear to have much of a presence in the largely peaceful area. ",
            "Meanwhile, progressives have highlighted elements of the area that much more accurately reflect the on-the-ground activities, discussing the hippie block party vibe and talking about how local activists are offering everything from free snacks and clothing to teach-ins on Marxism and harm reduction clinics.",
            "The massive chasm between the two viewpoints shows just how far apart conservatives and liberals have drifted during the Trump era. And Trump — backed by an array of conservative outlets, pundits and far-right groups — has frequently stoked those divisions with fire-and-brimstone rhetoric. The result is two sides that are increasingly retreating to their respective sides.",
            "“What I see is that the left is pretty much setting up a parallel country, a parallel system of law and order and parallel media,” said Neil McCabe, a national political reporter for The Tennessee Star and a former correspondent for the pro-Trump One America News Network. As a movement conservative, he added, he had given up on trying to find common ground with progressives, blaming them for leaving the right behind and rejecting them. “We conservatives didn't realize how far the left had gone towards separating and divorcing us.”",
            "Autonomous zones are nothing new. The ideology behind CHAZ dates back to the autonomous Marxist movements of Italy in the 1960s, emerging every so often in Europe among radical leftist movements that attempt to create post-capitalist communes. These efforts historically have ended quickly after negotiations with political leaders, according to Alexander Reid Ross, an instructor at Portland State University and the author of “Against the Fascist Creep.” ",
            "But CHAZ emerged in an altogether different environment, an outgrowth of the recent wave of Black Lives Matter protests in the wake of a black Minneapolis man’s killing at the hands of a police officer. After nearly two weeks of clashes between Seattle law enforcement and protesters — which, at times, included tactics such as tear gas and pepper balls — the police department deployed a drastic de-escalation tactic: They removed officers from the scene and retreated to a perimeter around the zone. ",
            "With no police officers, CHAZ was established. Over the weekend, Black Lives Matter activists renamed the area Capitol Hill Organized Protest, arguing that the area was not actually aspiring to autonomy or secession. But by then, the demands of the CHAZ had ballooned far beyond addressing systemic racism in policing: In an open letter published on June 10, the activists listed several reforms they hoped the city would undertake, including degentrification initiatives, free college programs and investment in community mental health services.",
            "Conservative reaction to Seattle’s autonomous zone has a particularly Trump-era undertone to it, Ross said. ",
            "Rather than letting local and state officials deal with the protesters, Trump “doubled down on vilifying a group that had nothing to do with the organization of the protests — not just dog whistling, but calling out his protesters or Second Amendment people to basically get out into the streets and get into the vigilante mode.”",
            "The broad support for the racial justice protests indicates the issue will not recede anytime soon, putting pressure on lawmakers of both parties to enact police reform. But while Trump has made some concessions to the movement’s demands, signing an executive order on Tuesday offering incentives for police departments to adopt some reforms, activists say his offerings have fallen woefully short of what is needed. ",
            "Trump has also found political utility in ranting about certain proposals from Black Lives Matter activists, including defunding or abolishing the police, and constantly reiterating his ever-present claim that antifa terrorists are floating among the protesters. And though CHAZ itself has not been a base camp for a leftist insurrection, its existence is based on rejecting existing governing and policing structures. Trump has reacted to that with calls for “LAW & ORDER.”",
            "“They've already walked away from the founding consensus,” McCabe said. “They're already at the point where they can have an autonomous Seattle zone.” ",
            "The MAGA sphere has also latched onto the fact that visibly armed members of progressive gun groups are patrolling CHAZ, confirming their belief that the zone is, purposefully or not, incepting an anti-government plot. Far-right groups, Ross said, have used the presence of armed individuals as a pretext to travel to the area under the auspices of protecting civil society, not to protest against CHAZ. ",
            "“The whole working purpose of the militia in the far right, is they kind of form this sort of porous membrane through which people travel in and out of the extreme right based on whether or not they're open racists,” he noted. “If you're going somewhere to stop the looting and to protect protesters from antifa outsiders, then you've got a narrative. You've got something clear that you can explain to people that doesn't make you sound like you're just there because you hate anti-racists.” ",
            "Ultimately, CHAZ may amount to a weekslong encampment in the middle of Seattle, maintained by rather enthusiastic activists, that eventually fades.",
            "“To the extent they've avoided violence, that's admirable. But even just trying to take it over is silly,” said Scott Walter, president of the conservative-libertarian think tank Capital Research Center, pointing out that the zone still relied on city services such as trash pickup. ",
            "As of Tuesday night, however, Trump seems determined to keep the CHAZ in the public eye, portraying local leaders there as cowed by potential antifa agents. ",
            "“Does anyone notice how little the Radical Left takeover of Seattle is being discussed in the Fake News Media,” he tweeted. “That is very much on purpose because they know how badly this weakness & ineptitude play politically. The Mayor & Governor should be ashamed of themselves. Easily fixed!” ",
            "Ironically, far-right groups and their allies targeting CHAZ might simply encourage the protest leaders to buckle down in response. ",
            "Ross said one example he could think of when a somewhat-autonomous zone lasted for years is Exarcheia, an anarchist-friendly neighborhood in the middle of Athens, Greece, that for years has housed refugees for free. Greece’s collective memory of their decades of living under military dictatorship allowed the neighborhood to retain those characteristics for years, Ross said, even though the government has cracked down more recently. ",
            "“People there are actually in support of [Exarcheia], because they don't want to see fascism in Greece,” he said."

            "Lawmakers fought over “Black Lives Matter” versus “All Lives Matter”; whether antifa is a terrorist group that should be investigated by the FBI or if the far-right boogaloo movement is a greater threat; whether Congress should require the FBI and other federal law enforcement agencies to tape their interviews with suspects, citing the Michael Flynn and Paul Manafort cases as prime reasons for doing so; and if the so-called Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone in Seattle is a mortal danger to the rest of republic.",
            "Sometime around dinnertime, the two sides fought for 40 minutes over the security of the southern border.",
            "But the most incendiary exchange took place between the normally low-key Rep. Cedric Richmond (D-La.) and Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), an acolyte of President Donald Trump who specializes in throwing rhetorical bombs at Democrats.",
            "The spat took place as Rep. Guy Reschenthaler (R-Pa.) offered an amendment to order federal agencies to consider whether antifa, the militant anti-fascist movement, is a terrorist organization. Judiciary Committee Chairman Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) dismissed the proposal as “arrant nonsense” — itself an extraordinary comment by a chair in the middle of a markup — while Rep. Hank Johnson (D-Ga.) claimed that antifa was a “figment of Donald Trump’s imagination.”",
            "Richmond, for his part, had clearly had enough of what he believed was Republican stalling. Richmond — an African American lawmaker who is the House Democratic liaison to Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee — lashed out at Republicans for trying to distract from the underlying issue of police violence.",

All the Republicans on the Judiciary Committee are white.",
            "Gaetz interrupted Richmond to ask whether he was “certain that none of us have nonwhite children, because you reflected on your black son and you said none of us could understand.”",
            "But Richmond cut off Gaetz: “It is about black males, black people in the streets that are getting killed. And if one of them happens to be your kid, I’m concerned about him, too. And clearly I’m more concerned about him than you are.”",
            "That enraged Gaetz, who angrily declared: “You’re claiming you’re more concerned for my family than I do? Who in the hell do you think you are? You don’t know how much we care about our families. This is outrageous.”",

            "The \"Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone,\" in fact, was a recurring theme throughout the proceedings. Rep. Debbie Lesko (R-Ariz.) at one point offered an amendment to cut off federal police grants to any municipality that allows an autonomous zone to be created within its borders.",
            "Rep. Pramilya Jayapal (D-Wash.), whose district is home to the Seattle zone, was upset by Republicans’ repeated attempts to raise the issue. She blamed Fox News and “right-wing media pundits” for what she said was “misinformation” being spread about her hometown.",

            "Multiple Democrats, meanwhile, repeatedly used their time to call out Republicans in the hearing room who occasionally took off their masks — in violation of a guidance circulated by Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Monday.

Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), remained maskless for much of the hearing. Rep. Tom McClintock (R-Calif.) declared that he didn‘t wear a mask because he didn‘t think contracting coronavirus was any more a health threat than getting the flu, and he dared Nadler to cite a House rule that required masks to be worn.

Their ideas are going to be more meaningful, so I’m just trying to listen to debate, rather than interject.”",
            "But the panel’s meeting on Wednesday also made history as the House’s first-ever virtual markup amid the global pandemic.",

            "After a white Minneapolis police officer killed a black man, George Floyd, by pinning Floyd by the neck with his knee for almost nine minutes, Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) called on the Justice Department to open a systematic investigation into the city’s police department. ",
            "Such probes are called pattern or practice investigations. Under the Obama administration, the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division conducted numerous probes into police departments, including Baltimore; Ferguson, Mo.; and Chicago. But under the Trump administration, DOJ officials have abandoned conducting such investigations of troubled police departments. And former Attorney General Jeff Sessions — in one of his last moves before Trump fired him in November 2018 — signed a memo that critics said defanged the probes. ",
            "After completing a pattern or practice investigation, the Justice Department enters talks with the police department and usually negotiates a court order mandating reforms. Civil rights activists argue the court orders are powerful tools for forcing departments to make changes. But many Republicans argue they can be too burdensome for departments and can damage officer morale. ",
            "In a letter responding to Klobuchar, the DOJ’s head of legislative affairs indicated the department is considering launching such a probe into the Minneapolis Police Department. The letter noted that DOJ has the authority to investigate “systemic violations of the Constitution” or of the law by police forces.",
            "“Where an investigation reveals a pattern or practice of such misconduct, the Section may initiate a civil action in the name of the United States against state or local officials and seek appropriate injunctive relief,” wrote Stephen Boyd, DOJ’s legislative affairs chief. “We will carefully consider the evidence in this case, as well as any additional information that comes to our attention, regarding your request for a civil pattern or practice investigation.” ",

            "“It’s been 23 days since George Floyd’s murder at the hands of the Minneapolis Police Department (MPD), and yet the DOJ has still not committed to investigate the patterns and practices of racially discriminatory policing at the MPD,” she said in a statement to POLITICO. “Any insinuation that there is not enough evidence to justify an immediate pattern and practice investigation is willfully ignoring the facts.”",
            "And the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, recently joined more than 200 groups to call on Barr to open a pattern or practice investigation of the Minneapolis Police Department. Vanita Gupta, the Leadership Conference’s president and CEO and the head of DOJ’s Civil Rights Division during the Obama administration, said there is ample evidence now to open such a probe. ",
            "“It is imperative for the Department of Justice to open a pattern or practice investigation into the Minneapolis police department,” she said in a statement to POLITICO. “Both Attorneys General Sessions and Barr abdicated their responsibilities in this area and failed to use this key, strategic tool to address systemic constitutional violations by law enforcement agencies.”",
            "The DOJ, meanwhile, remains noncommittal — but hasn’t ruled out such a move. ",
            "Asked about whether the Justice Department should launch a pattern and practice probe into the Minneapolis police department during a June 7 interview with CBS News, Barr said he didn’t see it as “warranted,” citing investigations underway by the state of Minnesota.",
            "Somewhat ambiguously, however, he added: “We still have to look into what kinds of use of force policies are used in that department, what the training has been and things like that. That’s not something we can do overnight.”",
            "It’s not clear whether Barr was referring to DOJ specifically conducting such an inquiry, or the justice system more generally.",
            "“The department considers a number of factors in determining the appropriate remedy to resolve a pattern or practice of constitutional violations by a law enforcement agency,” a DOJ official told POLITICO. “It is the mission of the Justice Department to ‘ensure public safety,’ and we will continue to encourage the proven, constitutional and proactive policing required to keep American neighborhoods safe from violent crime.”"

            "The U.S. pulled out of the U.N. Human Rights Council in 2018, did not participate in dramatic debate on racism within the country.",
            "The family of George Floyd made a dramatic appeal to the United Nations today for the world to hold the United States accountable for police brutality and systemic racism.",
            "Philonise Floyd, George Floyd’s brother, addressed a special meeting of the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva, Switzerland via video address, telling the assembled diplomats “my brother tortured and murdered on camera is the way black people are treated by police in America.” ",
            "“I am my brother’s keeper” Floyd continued. “You in the United Nations are our brothers’ and sisters’ keepers. I am asking you to help me get justice.” ",
            "The special session was held after 54 African countries called for a discussion on the “current racially inspired human rights violations, systematic racism, police brutality against people of African descent and violence against peaceful protests” in the United States. The two-day debate will continue tomorrow at 9 a.m. ET, after which the Council’s 47 members will vote on whether to establish an independent inquiry into U.S. racism and police brutality.",
            "Dozens of speakers lashed out at the U.S. — the world’s most powerful country and the biggest financial contributor to the United Nations, overall — in a highly unusual diplomatic scene, chaired by Council President Elisabeth Tichy-Fisslberger of Austria.",
            "At times the discussion turned into a platform for America’s foes, including Iran, which described George Floyd’s killing as a “public execution” at odds with Martin Luther King Jr.’s vision for a peaceful American society, and Cuba, which called severe racism “not the exception” but “part and parcel” of American life.",
            "The debate was the realization of an effort begun by civil rights activist Malcolm X in 1964, when he urged African states to call out the U.S. over racism and government discrimination and brutality. Fifty-six years later, many of the same problems exist in the U.S. What’s changed is that African nations are now more established and organized at the United Nations, with more political capital to spend highlighting problems outside their own borders.",
            "Speaking for the African Union group of 54 countries, the Central African Republic representative described George Floyd’s killing as “utterly unjustified,” while Somalia sought to put the issue in the context of other global challenges, calling racism “more dangerous than Covid-19.”",

            "The U.S. had no opportunity to respond. The Trump administration pulled the country out of the U.N. body in 2018, citing the prominent role played at the forum by notable human rights violators including Syria, Sudan and Saudi Arabia, and what Nikki Haley, then U.S. Ambassador to the U.N., described as the body’s “unending hostility towards Israel.” U.S. criticism of the Council dates back to its formation in 2006 when George W. Bush's Republican administration declined to take up a seat — a position reversed in 2009 by Democratic President Barack Obama.",
            "Ambassador Andrew Bremberg, who heads the U.S. mission in Geneva, said in a statement that the U.S. \"recognizes and is committed to addressing its shortcomings including racial discrimination.\" Bremberg added that \"any (U.N.) resolution on this topic that calls out countries by name should be inclusive\" of other countries with deep problems. ",
            "Many of the speakers at today’s session, particularly U.S. allies, sought to emphasize that racism is not just an American problem but a global one. “None of our countries is immune” said Karin Bolin, Sweden’s representative.",
            "Croatia spoke on behalf of 27 EU countries and a group of smaller European countries saying: “We need to look into our own souls” and “put an end to such hate crimes” and “remain vigilant against the excessive use of force,” Croatia said.",

            "The House’s highest-ranking Republicans are racing to distance themselves from a leading GOP congressional candidate in Georgia after POLITICO uncovered hours of Facebook videos in which she expresses racist, Islamophobic and anti-Semitic views.",
            "The candidate, Marjorie Taylor Greene, suggested that Muslims do not belong in government; thinks black people “are held slaves to the Democratic Party”; called George Soros, a Jewish Democratic megadonor, a Nazi; and said she would feel “proud” to see a Confederate monument if she were black because it symbolizes progress made since the Civil War.",
            "Greene finished first in a primary for a deep-red, northwest Georgia seat last week by a nearly 2-to-1 margin over the second-place candidate. She is entering an August runoff as the favorite to secure the Republican nomination for a district where that is tantamount to winning the general election in November. Her initial victory — which has sparked panic in GOP circles — comes as Republicans are grappling with a national reckoning over racial injustice and police brutality after George Floyd, an unarmed black man, was killed by a Minneapolis police officer last month. ",
            "Republicans had just felt relief after they finally ousted Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa), a controversial member with a long history of making racist remarks, in a primary earlier this month. ",
            "Now GOP lawmakers, aides and operatives fear Greene — a wealthy businesswoman who has already drawn national attention because of her belief in a trove of QAnon conspiracy theories — could create an even bigger black eye for the party if she wins the nomination. Greene will face neurosurgeon John Cowan in the Aug. 11 primary runoff.",
            "“These comments are appalling, and Leader McCarthy has no tolerance for them,” said Drew Florio, a spokesman for House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.).",
            "House Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) went further, throwing his weight behind Greene’s opponent.",
            "“The comments made by Ms. Greene are disgusting and don’t reflect the values of equality and decency that make our country great,” Scalise said in a statement. “I will be supporting Dr. Cowan.”",
            "In recordings obtained by POLITICO, Greene described Islamic nations under Sharia law as places where men have sex with \"little boys, little girls, multiple women\" and \"marry their sisters\" and \"their cousins.\" She suggested the 2018 midterms — which ushered in the most diverse class of House freshmen — was part of “an Islamic invasion of our government” and that “anyone that is a Muslim that believes in Sharia law does not belong in our government.” ",
            "In other videos, she directly compared Black Lives Matter activists to the neo-Nazis and Ku Klux Klan members who marched at a white nationalist rally three years ago in Charlottesville, Va., denouncing them all as “idiots.” And Greene forcefully rejected the notion there are racial disparities in the U.S. or that skin color affects the “quality” of one's life: “Guess what? Slavery is over,” she said. “Black people have equal rights.” ",
            "When asked for comment on quotes from the videos, Greene campaign manager Isaiah Wartman did not deny their veracity but declined to elaborate.",
            "“Thank[s] for the reminder about Soros. We forgot to put him in our newest ad. We’re fixing that now,” he wrote in an email to POLITICO. “Would you like me to send you a copy?”",
            "Sitting cross-legged on the floor and sporting an American flag baseball cap, Greene said in one video that unemployment — which affects people of color at disproportionately higher rates — is simply the product of “bad choices” and being “lazy.” ",
            "Minorities, Greene added, are being held back in society by gangs, drugs, a lack of education, Planned Parenthood and abortions — “not white people.” ",
            "“I know a ton of white people that are as lazy and sorry and probably worse than black people,” she said. “And that has everything to do with their bad choices and their personal responsibility. That is not a skin-color issue.”",
            "Greene later implied that black women have it easier because of affirmative action, complaining they are more likely to get into a college than a white male if they have the same GPA.",
            "“The most mistreated group of people in the United States today are white males,” Greene said as she wrapped up one of the videos.",
            "The recordings, in which Greene spends hours ranting to her social media followers, were taped direct-to-camera. The date of the videos is not clear, but they appear to have been recorded between late 2017 and early 2019. She initially launched a campaign in June of last year for Democratic Rep. Lucy McBath’s seat in Atlanta's northern suburbs, but switched to the staunchly conservative 14th District when Rep. Tom Graves (R-Ga.) announced his plans to retire.",
            "The top three House GOP leaders, as well as the head of the party’s campaign arm, denounced Greene’s rhetoric upon learning from POLITICO of her derogatory comments about blacks, Muslims and Jews.",
            "While the National Republican Congressional Committee does not get involved in primaries, NRCC spokesman Chris Pack said Chairman Tom Emmer (R-Minn.) is “personally disgusted by this rhetoric and condemns it in the strongest possible terms.” ",
            "And a spokesman for House Republican Conference Chairwoman Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) — who forcefully rebuked King and called on him to step down — said, “obviously, Rep. Cheney opposes these offensive and bigoted comments.”",
            "McCarthy already pulled his support for another controversial GOP candidate in California, Ted Howze, after POLITICO uncovered dozens of social media posts that demeaned Muslims and immigrants.",
            "Despite Greene’s penchant for controversy — she has already faced public criticism for taking a photo with a white supremacist, floating a conspiracy theory that the Las Vegas shooting massacre was a plot to abolish the Second Amendment and calling one of the student activists from Parkland high school “little Hitler”— Greene has earned some congressional support.",
            "She nabbed endorsements from Rep. Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.), the chairman of the conservative House Freedom Caucus; Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), one of President Donald Trump’s closest allies on Capitol Hill; Rep. Jody Hice (R-Ga.), a Freedom Caucus member and former pastor who rescinded his endorsement the day after this story was published; and the House Freedom Fund, the political arm for the Freedom Caucus. Jordan said he disagreed with her statements but did not pull his endorsement. Biggs did not respond to a request for comment for this story.",
            "There is now a growing effort in the GOP to rally around Greene’s opponent. Georgia Reps. Buddy Carter and Drew Ferguson both backed Cowan on Wednesday morning, as did Rep. Austin Scott. Ferguson called her comments “abhorrent” and said in a statement that she “shouldn’t have a place in Congress.”",
            "Scott echoed a similar sentiment, saying “her statements would render her incapable of being an effective member of Congress.”",
            "“This isn’t something that happened 10 years ago, when she said something out of context,” Scott said in an interview.",
            "House Democrats have also pounced on Greene, even before the publication of the videos. Rep. Cheri Bustos of Illinois, the chair of the House Democratic campaign arm, called her a “next-generation Steve King” in a statement.",
            "And Greene’s opponent, Cowan, is making a similar argument ahead of the runoff.",
            "\"These comments do not reflect the views of the people of the 14th District,\" he said in an interview. \"I think she would embarrass our state, and I’m going to do everything I can to keep her from representing northwest Georgia in Congress.\"",
            "In one of the videos, Greene offered a full-throated defense of Confederate statues, saying that if she were a black person she would be “proud” to see a Confederate monument \"because I’d say, ‘Look how far I have come in this country.’” ",
            "Her comments are surfacing amid a heated national debate over whether Confederate statues should be removed and whether military bases named after Confederate leaders should be renamed — a debate that is also unfolding in Congress.",
            "Greene blamed the country’s racial wounds on “identity politics” and President Barack Obama, who, she said, won black voters only because of “the color of his skin.” She also suggested that’s why Obama identifies as black, even though he is “half-white” and “American,” Greene noted.",
            "And during another offensive diatribe, Greene accused Democrats of “trying to keep the black people in a modern-day form of slavery” and said black Republicans get called “coon” and “Uncle Toms” by liberal black voters.",
            "“It’s a slavery system to keep their vote,” she said.",
            "In her videos, Greene is particularly preoccupied with the increase in Muslim members of Congress. She referred to freshman Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) as \"that woman out of Minnesota\" who \"has got to wear a head covering.\" She said members should not be able to take the oath of office on a Koran: \"No! You have to be sworn in on the Bible.\"",
            "In 2018, Omar and freshman Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) became the first two Muslim women elected to Congress. They have become top targets of the right, along with freshman Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts, who are also women of color.",
            "\"There is an Islamic invasion into our government offices right now,” Greene said. “You saw after midterm elections what we saw so many Muslims elected. I don’t know the exact number but there were quite a few.”",
            "She said Muslims “are not being held back in any way” because the Constitution guarantees equality. “But what you people want,” she said, “is special treatment. You want to rise above us, and that’s what we’re against.”",
            "And in another rant, she urged adherents of Sharia to stay in their own countries and leave the U.S. alone. ",
            "\"If you want Islam and Sharia law, you stay over there in the Middle East,\" she said. \"You stay there, and you go to Mecca and do all your thing. And, you know what, you can have a whole bunch of wives, or goats, or sheep, or whatever you want. You stay over there. But in America, see, we’ve made it this great, great country. We don’t want it messed up.\"",
            "She also spends several minutes attacking Imtiaz Ahmad Mohammad, a candidatefor the Florida state House, because he is Muslim and an immigrant. ",
            "\"So let me tell you something. This man is not born in America. He’s from Pakistan. OK?,\" she said, warning he was the only candidate who had filed for the seat, and that “his last name is Mohammad.” ",
            "She then attempted to recruit a challenger: \"Anyone that lives in that district, you better sign your butt up and run against this guy,” she said. “Because we cannot let him win.\"",
            "In a video and on social media, Greene has also touted an anti-Semitic conspiracy theory that Soros, a Holocaust survivor, collaborated with the Nazis. ",
            "“George Soros says dark forces have been awakened by Trump’s win. I don’t think so,” she said in one video. “George Soros is the piece of crap that turned in — he’s a Jew — he turned in his own people over to the Nazis.”",
            "In February 2019, Greene replied to a tweet that included several memes accusing Soros of being part of a secret totalitarian world government. One picture showed Soros as a vampire who controls “every single Democrat politician.” In her reply, Greene called Soros “the Nazi himself trying to continue what was not finished.” ",
            "The Republican Jewish Coalition was one of the first GOP groups to denounce her publicly after the primary."

        "body": [
            "The full House will take up Democrats' sweeping reform bill next week. ",
            "The House Judiciary Committee advanced a sweeping police reform bill late Wednesday following a day of emotional exchanges and pitched anger among lawmakers on the panel as they confronted questions about institutional racism and police brutality against black Americans.",
            "After nearly 12 hours of tense debate, the committee approved the bill along party lines with all Republicans voting in opposition. The Democrats’ plan, which will go to the House floor next week, would ban chokeholds and no-knock warrants, limit officers’ immunity from prosecution and establish a national database of police misconduct.",
            "Senior Democrats, led by Congressional Black Caucus Chair Karen Bass of California, quickly crafted the comprehensive reform bill in response to the nationwide unrest following the police killing of George Floyd, an unarmed black man, in Minneapolis on May 25. The GOP-controlled Senate will take up its own police reform bill next week but the proposal has already been widely panned by Democrats as \"toothless\" and \"a sham.\"",
            "Still, senior lawmakers in both parties continue to insist they can come to a compromise that will reach President Donald Trump's desk in the coming weeks. Both parties and the president feel pressure to act as protests continue for the third straight week — a nation unabating in its fury over the senseless killings of unarmed black Americans by police. ",
            "Democrats on the Judiciary panel spent almost a dozen hours Wednesday sweeping aside a series of Republican amendments, including a proposal to require that police interviews with suspects be recorded, a proposal Democrats said they were open to at later stages of the process. ",
            "But as the day wore on, Democrats increasingly sniped at Republicans over what they claimed were efforts to drag in extraneous issues that turned the focus away from questions of race. That dynamic turned heated when Rep. Cedric Richmond (D-La.), a former chairman of the CBC, accused the all-white Republican side of the dais of racial bias, \"unconscious\" or otherwise, and said they were making \"a mockery of the pain that exists in my community.\"",
            "Richmond's remarks, which included a reference to his son, prompted an exchange with Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), who questioned how Richmond could be certain none of the Republicans on the panel had black children. ",
            "\"I already know there are people on the other side who have black grandchildren,\" Richmond replied. \"It is not about the color of your kids. It is about black males, black people in the streets that are getting killed. And if one of them happens to be your kid, I’m concerned about him too. And clearly I’m more concerned about him than you are.\"",
            "Gaetz shot back angrily, saying Richmond went over the line: \"You’re claiming you’re more concerned for my family than I do? Who in the hell do you think you are?\"",
            "The exchange encapsulated a day of raw emotion on Capitol Hill. To Democrats, speed is of the essence — not only because of the realities of the political calendar but because after decades of failed efforts to implement sweeping reform, the national landscape has shifted after Floyd's killing and created an opening for genuine action.",
            "Republicans on the committee, led by Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, emphasized that they wanted a more deliberative approach, citing measures offered by Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.) and an executive order signed by Trump earlier this week as thoughtful steps in the right direction. ",
            "Those measures beef up police reporting requirements and encourage reforms — but don’t mandate them. ",
            "Republicans also offered amendments to ask the FBI for a report on whether antifa is a domestic terrorist organization and to bar federal grants to a so-called autonomous zone in Seattle that Republicans have described as a lawless \"terrorist\" stronghold. Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), who sits on the panel fiercely pushed back on that claim, saying the area is a venue for peaceful protest. ",
            "Other GOP amendments offered Wednesday would have struck the qualified immunity provision in the bill and would raise the maximum sentence for lynching crimes to the death penalty.",
            "\"Not one single Republican was consulted\" in the crafting of the bill, said Jordan, the top Republican on the panel. \"I hope today that you will embrace our thoughtful amendments that we plan to offer.\"",
            "But Democrats did not relent as the debate stretched late into the evening Wednesday, despite what was an inevitable result: the party-line advancement of the bill. The House will vote on the bill June 25, with enough Democrats already signed on as co-sponsors to guarantee its passage. ",
            "Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced Wednesday that the Senate will take up the GOP’s policing bill next week. But senior Democrats on the Judiciary panel were quick to dismiss to GOP bill, calling it a half-measure that doesn't match the needs of those protesting for reform.",
            "\"What Sen. Scott is offering is a sham,\" House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) told reporters. ",
            "Bass, who also sits on the Judiciary Committee, panned the Republican bill, saying it \"mimics\" Democrats' proposal \"but without the teeth.\" ",
            "And Speaker Nancy Pelosi called the GOP proposal \"window dressing\" and \"toothless\" in an interview on CNN Wednesday.",
            "Yet, unlike previous efforts at police reform, there appears to be room — however narrow — for bipartisan compromise. Members of the Judiciary Committee like Rep. Kelly Armstrong (R-N.D.), a former public defender, have engaged with Democrats to find areas of agreement on policies like police body cameras, qualified immunity and sentencing disparities.",
            "Armstrong said he's had productive discussions with committee Democrats including Richmond, David Cicilline of Rhode Island and Joe Neguse of Colorado, on potential bipartisan legislation. But he noted that the committee, historically an emblem of congressional partisanship and strained this Congress by impeachment, has \"a lot of trust problems.\"",
            "And that was apparent in the panel's first vote Wednesday — with Democrats voting down Armstrong's amendment to require federal law enforcement agencies to record all interviews with potential suspects. ",
            "Democrats initially asked Armstrong to withdraw the amendment so they could work together on incorporating the idea into the final bill. But Armstrong refused as he and several other Republicans connected the proposal to the FBI’s 2017 interview with former national security adviser Michael Flynn, who Trump allies allege was railroaded by law enforcement. ",
            "Democrats slammed Republicans' repeated efforts to reignite the Flynn debate, saying this hearing was about the countless unarmed black men and women who have lost their lives at the hands of police. ",
            "\"We're not here to talk about Michael Flynn. That's beneath the dignity of this institution and the lives that have been lost,\" Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) said. ",
            "Jeffries then gave powerful testimony about having to have \"that conversation\" with his teenage son before he participated in a Black Lives Matter protest in Brooklyn recently. ",
            "\"Some may even look at you as a threat because of the color of your skin. ... Do not respond or react to any unjustified abuse against you,\" Jeffries recounted to the committee. \"Even if you're completely in the right, you're being harassed, you're being abused, you can't respond — because it may result in your life being taken.\" ",

            "To many watching the historic protests against racism and police brutality unfold across the country, it was a call that came out of nowhere: Defund the Police.",
            "Yet hours after the first videos of George Floyd’s killing at the hands of a Minneapolis police officer went viral online, those three words became the rallying cry of a movement that had suddenly won America’s undivided attention.",
            "To critics — chief among them the president of the United States and his allies, as well as the elected Democrats who quickly distanced themselves from a slogan they deemed too radical to embrace — it was baffling. Was it meant to be taken literally? Seriously? Both? Neither? Were the protesters really calling for no police whatsoever?",
            "But the demands to abolish the police didn’t spring from nowhere — they have deep roots among a group of activists and academics who have been arguing for years that merely reforming a system they see as fundamentally broken is futile: To truly address the unfair way police departments treat Black and Latino communities, they say, you need to tear down the entire edifice and start over.",
            "The modern epicenter of the Defund the Police movement is Minneapolis, where a variety of groups motivated by past episodes of police brutality have been organizing for nearly a decade. One of them, the women and LGBTQ-led Black Visions Collective, penned one of the first petitions to defund their city’s police department on May 25, almost immediately after Floyd was killed. “TELL MINNEAPOLIS CITY COUNCIL TO DEFUND THE POLICE,” the headline on the petition read. Within a week, protests had sprung up in all 50 states, all defined by support of black lives and opposition to police violence. ",
            "“We did a statewide and national call and that sparked uprisings in other places,” said Oluchi Omeoga, an organizer and core team member with the Black Visions Collective.",
            "As the calls to defund police departments echoed across the country, they forced elected officials to reckon with a movement that had suddenly broken into mainstream discussion. The breakthrough came after years of seeing activists’ impact diluted through incremental reform measures or wholesale ignoring of their demands.",
            "“It’s different than the 2013, 2012, 2017 iteration of the Black Lives Matter movement,” Omeoga said. “We’re no longer asking for convictions or folks to be indicted. We’re asking for an actual narrative shift, a seismic shift in the systems of police.”",
            "Since Floyd’s death, city councils in more than a dozen cities including Minneapolis, New York and Washington have proposed reductions in their police departments' annual budgets. Los Angeles’ mayor Eric Garcetti has embraced a more limited role for the city’s police department. Congress, too has proposed legislation that addresses police violence and aims to vote on the bill by the end of June. The words “DEFUND THE POLICE” now appear in giant yellow letters along 16th Street in Washington, D.C., mere blocks from the White House and made indelible on street-mapping software. ",
            "But perhaps most notably, many Americans who might have never imagined communities without police officers no longer see it as an impossible feat, though most still oppose the idea. A new POLITICO/Morning Consult poll shows that nearly two-thirds of Americans support major reforms in policing, while close to one-third say they are in favor of defunding the police. ",
            "“I think what we're seeing now,” said Kim Burke, a senior fellow at the Center for Policing Equity, “is a renewed call and an increased attention to these fundings as a product of the large-scale and incredibly rapid changes we saw the government take during the corona epidemic.”",
            "Burke said the recent stampede toward police reform had shown that “government can almost overnight change policy, allocate money differently, change city budgets differently in the name of public safety. And this is what black communities have been asking for years.”",
            "Even if the sudden discussion of defunding the police has been astonishingly swift, it’s an idea decades in the making. Scholars and activists on police and prison abolition have been pushing an invest-divest model that calls for lower police budgets, removal of officers from schools, demilitarization of police equipment and reallocation of police funds for schools, housing and public health. The Movement for Black Lives, a coalition of more than 50 black-led organizations under the purview of the Black Lives Matter movement, adopted this idea into its core organizing vision in 2016, marking a shift away from a platform that called for fair treatment under the law for black Americans to a focus on stripping police systems altogether.",
            "Andrea Ritchie, who has studied and engaged in movements to defund police as early as the 1991 Rodney King uprisings, said the call has been for “disinvestment not just financially but politically, ideologically and I think for many of us, emotionally.” ",
            "“It’s not time for just budget cuts across the board. That’s not what ‘defund the police’ is calling for,” Ritchie said. “What ‘defund the police’ is calling for is saying, ‘we need to take money, power and equipment and scope of operation away from police and we need to invest that money and more into what people need to survive this pandemic and this economic crisis.’”",
            "America — plagued by economic turmoil and growing outrage at President Trump’s law-and-order approach to policing — provided a perfect backdrop for the movement to grow. This time, Omeoga argued, instead of repeating a pattern in which all the attention zeroed in a single focal point — such as Minneapolis or Louisville, or Ferguson, Mo., in 2014 — activists are encouraging change within their own communities.",
            "“Now we’re calling for folks not to come to Minneapolis but to see the similarities that are happening in all of these other places and to actually ask your local county, state legislature to make a change and also demand the defunding of their police departments,” Omeoga said.",
            "Organizers say their work now involves helping interested parties understand what a safe community looks like without a police presence. The idea has not fully taken hold in some circles, who say they support police reform but oppose defunding or abolishing police.",
            "Top Democrats who are leading the congressional response to police reform have maintained that they are not interested in defunding the police. South Carolina congressman Jim Clyburn, fully distanced himself from the idea on Sunday, calling instead for a “reimagining” of policing. Other figures have taken issue with the phrasing, saying it alienates those who might be on the fence about how to change police moving forward, while embracing the general concept of shifting resources and responsibilities to other parts of government.",
            "Black activist groups of all kinds are now seeking to capitalize on all the attention and rush of support for their platforms, while coalescing around a shared goal of aggressive police reform, if not outright defunding. Black organizations across the country have seen their membership numbers skyrocket and netted millions in donations.",
            "“I think that this is a great conversation for this country to be having, especially in the middle of a global pandemic,” said Alicia Garza, co-founder of Black Lives Matter. “Especially at the brink of a recession, where we've got, I believe, the latest figures of 40 percent black unemployment and facing a massive crisis in our democracy. I think these are absolutely the right questions that this country needs to be grappling with right now.”",
            "The biggest question that remains, Garza explained, is what the alternative to policing would be in the conversation about community safety. ",
            "“You cannot police your way or jail your way, or frankly, kill your way out of crisis.\""

            "Most voters believe police departments need to be seriously overhauled but don’t back the “Defund the Police” movement, according to a new POLITICO/Morning Consult poll conducted after weeks of protests against racial injustice and police brutality.",
            "In the poll, conducted Friday through Sunday, a combined 59 percent say police departments across the country need either a complete overhaul (22 percent) or major reforms (37 percent). Just over 1-in-4, 27 percent, say police departments need a minor overhaul, and only 5 percent think they don’t need any reforms at all.",
            "But that support does not extend to the slogan “Defund the Police,” which some activists say is about reforming law enforcement as much or more than actually making sizable budget cuts. By a nearly 2-to-1 margin, more voters oppose the movement to “Defund the Police” (57 percent) than support it (29 percent). More than 4-in-10, 43 percent, strongly oppose the movement.",
            "“While nearly 60 percent agree police departments are in need of major reforms, voters remain skeptical of the ‘Defund the Police’ movement,” said Kyle Dropp, co-founder and chief research officer at Morning Consult.",
            "The disparity suggests the mood of the electorate three weeks after the killing of George Floyd by police in Minneapolis puts both political parties on the defensive: Republicans, including President Donald Trump, are exploring reforms to policing — while Democrats, including presumptive presidential nominee Joe Biden, are keeping the activists calling for localities to “Defund the Police” at arm’s length.",
            "A large majority of Democratic voters, 82 percent, believe police departments need a complete overhaul or major reforms, compared with just 33 percent of Republicans. Among independents, 60 percent think departments need a complete overhaul or major reforms.",
            "Voters are divided on whether police departments receive too much funding (25 percent), the right amount of funding (26 percent) or not enough funding (28 percent). Only 18 percent of Democratic voters think police departments don’t receive enough funding, while just 8 percent of Republicans say the police get too much funding.",
            "As for the “Defund the Police” movement, it garners support from 48 percent of Democrats, 11 percent of Republicans and 26 percent of independents.",
            "Voters were evenly split on redirecting funding from law enforcement to community development programs. A split-sample experiment also found no significant difference in the results whether respondents were asked about redirecting funding in their local communities or in police departments across the country.",
            "Also in the poll, 72 percent of voters say things in the country are now on the wrong track, the highest “wrong track” number the poll has recorded in the Trump era.",
            "The poll shows 40 percent of voters approve of the job Trump is doing as president, essentially unchanged from 39 percent last week. A majority, 57 percent, disapprove of Trump’s job performance.",

            "The decision comes amid a pressure campaign from lawmakers in both parties who are pushing for sweeping criminal-justice reforms in the aftermath of a string of police killings of unarmed African Americans and subsequent nationwide protests.",
            "The Senate will hold a procedural vote next week on Sen. Tim Scott’s bill, which was unveiled Wednesday by the South Carolina Republican and a group of GOP senators. But it’s unclear whether Democrats will join Republicans to meet the 60-vote threshold and begin floor debate on possible amendments. Democrats have panned Scott’s bill as a watered-down version of their own plan, which the House Judiciary Committee is expected to advance later Wednesday.",
            "“Our Democratic friends — if they want to make a law and not just try to make a point, I hope that they’ll join us in getting on the bill and trying to move forward in the way the Senate does move forward when it’s trying to actually get an outcome,” McConnell said.",
            "“We’re serious about making a law here,” he added. “It’s not about trying to create partisan differences. This is about coming together and getting an outcome.”",
            "McConnell’s announcement was a stark reversal from earlier in the week, when Senate Republican leaders posited that the chamber would not consider police reform until after the Independence Day recess. But public opinion has swung sharply in favor of reforms in recent weeks, putting additional pressure on GOP leaders.",
            "“I think this package speaks very clearly to the young person who’s concerned when he’s stopped by law enforcement officers — we see you,” said Scott, the lone African American GOP senator.",
            "It remains unclear whether Democrats will give Republicans the votes to open up a formal debate on Scott’s bill. Scott said he has had frequent conversations with Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), who co-authored the Democratic plan, but there are no active bipartisan negotiations, raising the prospect that next week’s procedural vote could fall along party lines.",
            "“I don't think the nation is going to allow us to lose the momentum,” an optimistic Scott told reporters.",
            "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) criticized the GOP proposal Wednesday, saying it fails to “rise to the moment.” Schumer noted that the GOP bill does not explicitly ban the use of chokeholds and “no-knock” warrants, unlike the Democratic proposal, and said it doesn’t include “real meaningful accountability for individual officers’ misconduct.”",
            "But Schumer didn’t close the door completely to negotiations and said he expects Senate Republicans to work with Democrats to make “significant improvement.”",
            "“This is not about letting the perfect be the enemy of the good. This is about replacing what’s ineffective with what’s effective, and we must have effective change,” he added, indicating that Democrats are not ruling out supporting a floor debate.",
            "Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) said Democrats “really need an understanding from Sen. McConnell” on whether it will be “a take it or leave it moment,” or if both sides intend to “sit down and legislate.”",
            "Scott’s bill requires additional disclosures about the use of force and codifies reporting requirements on the use of “no-knock” warrants, according to two sources and a copy of the bill text obtained by POLITICO on Tuesday night. It also provides incentives for chokehold bans.",
            "The bill, which was formally introduced Wednesday, comes as the country faces a reckoning over police brutality in the wake of the death of George Floyd at the hands of a Minneapolis police officer.",
            "The proposal has already drawn criticism from Democrats for not going far enough to reform police practices. The Democratic plan would ban chokeholds, limit qualified immunity for police officers and stop no-knock warrants in federal drug cases.",
            "The House is expected to vote as soon as next week on the Democratic bill. Members of both parties are hoping to get a bill to the president's desk before the July 4 recess, but so far there are few indications that Democrats and Republicans can strike an agreement.",
            "The GOP bill would create reporting requirements on the use of deadly force by officers and reduce federal funding for state and local police departments that fail to comply. In addition, the legislation requires state and local governments to submit reports on “no-knock” warrants to the Justice Department. It would also limit eligibility for funding if a law enforcement agency does not have a policy that prohibits the use of chokeholds “except when deadly force is authorized.”",
            "White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany said later Wednesday that President Donald Trump “is fully in support of the Scott bill” and “every element of it.”",
            "The measure also provides grants for the purchase of body cameras and the development of policies and procedures related to their use. In addition, it increases penalties for false police reports and creates a Commission on the Social Status of Black Men and Boys. That bipartisan measure would provide a report on conditions that affect African American men, such as education, health care and the criminal justice system. Another commission would review the criminal justice system entirely.",
            "The GOP bill also would make lynching a federal crime. While the House passed a widely backed anti-lynching bill in February, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) recently called for changes to the legislation to ensure that lynching charges don't extend to minor injuries. Paul’s objections resulted in a heated exchange on the Senate floor earlier this month with Booker and Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.).",

            "Some advocates are optimistic, including Holly Harris, president and executive director of the Justice Action Network, who described Scott's bill as a \"baseline for negotiation.\" In a final compromise bill, Harris said she would like to see provisions that address demilitarization and qualified immunity.

            "And with protests over racial injustice and police brutality still gripping dozens of cities, both parties have moved aggressively to present some kind of legislative framework to address long-ignored problems in policing. But there’s also been little incentive for the two parties to broker a compromise as they each look to lay down their respective markers on reform.",
            "“Truth be told, if these conversations had started in the very beginning, I think my answer would be much more affirmative,” Rep. Dean Phillips (D-Minn.), who has privately discussed the legislation with several Republicans, said in an interview. “My unfortunate belief is that absent collaboration from the very beginning, it makes it incredibly difficult.”",
            "Still, Phillips, noted: “There’s a lot of common ground right now, my hope is that we at least focus on the common ground and accomplish that now.”",
            "The House Judiciary Committee will take up the landmark legislation in a marathon session starting Wednesday morning, three weeks after George Floyd’s death at the hands of Minneapolis officers has galvanized both sides of Capitol Hill into action. The markup comes one week after the panel heard gripping testimony from Floyd’s brother, Philonise Floyd, who pleaded with lawmakers to “stop the pain” and deliver change. ",
            "But both the committee vote Wednesday and the full House vote next week are expected to largely fall along party lines. Democrats have enough support within their caucus to pass the bill on their own, with no interest in softening their proposal to win over Republicans. ",
            "Senate Republicans, meanwhile, will release their own police reform bill on Wednesday, which will build on Trump’s executive order and could be on the floor as soon as next week, despite earlier predictions that the Senate wouldn’t take up the bill until after July 4. ",
            "And leaders in both parties are already publicly bickering. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) slammed Democrats over their bill, which he said was “going nowhere” in the Senate. He said Democrats were seeking to “federalize” the police system and trying to “control everything in Washington.”",

            "“For the leader of the Senate to say, 'It's going nowhere, we don't want any of that,' is really disgraceful — and really ignores the concerns of the American people,” Pelosi said on MSNBC. “I feel very, very disappointed by the dangerous statement made by the Republican leader of the Senate.”",
            "Still, lawmakers and aides in both parties say they think there is a path to “yes.” They just aren’t sure how to get there yet. ",
            "House Democrats assembled their bill — which would crack down on excessive force and ban chokeholds, enforce strict transparency standards and demand accountability for officer misconduct with a national database to track offenses — about two weeks after Floyd’s death. ",
            "Trump signed an executive order on Tuesday, largely limited to encouraging best practices through federal grants. And the normally sluggish Senate is moving quickly on a GOP-led policing bill that builds upon Trump’s actions.",

Tim Scott (R-S.C.), the lone African American Republican senator, which POLITICO obtained Tuesday night and is set to be unveiled Wednesday, would create new reporting requirements on the use of deadly force by officers, and reduce federal funding for local departments that fail to comply. It also would limit eligibility for funding for police departments that do not ban the use of chokeholds.",
            "Most Democrats have panned the GOP approach as cosmetic and too limited, while Pelosi dismissed Trump’s executive order Tuesday, saying it “falls sadly and seriously short of what is required to combat the epidemic of racial injustice and police brutality.”",

            "The politics in both parties have significantly shifted in the weeks since Americans took to the streets across the country to protest Floyd’s death along with the killings of many other unarmed black men and women by police. ",

            "Just on Wednesday, Congressional Black Caucus Chairwoman Karen Bass (D-Calif.) apologized after saying the call to defund the police is “probably one of the worst slogans ever,” vocalizing concerns from many Democrats who worry it could overshadow their police reforms push and give Trump and Republicans a line of attack.",
            "“Saying that’s the worst slogan ever was the dumbest response ever and I shouldn’t have said it and I’m sorry for saying it,” Bass tweeted. “I would never mean to malign a movement of activists who I know are fighting for transformative change.”",
            "And some Republicans have started warming to the idea of banning chokeholds by police, a policy change that would’ve been unfathomable just weeks ago. But the support isn’t universal within the GOP and it’s unclear how far the party is willing to go on the issue. ",

At least seven Democrats would need to support that process, assuming all 53 Republican senators are on board.",

            "What’s happening in these four blocks that shook the world is indeed an occupation, but it looks nothing like the “totalitarian takeover” touted on the conservative network.",
            "SEATTLE — It seems I live in a city undergoing a “totalitarian takeover” that will lead to “fascist outcomes” and could “metastasize across the country.” Its government “has handed over an entire portion of the city to domestic terrorists.” This “group of rogue protesters” is attempting “to get a stranglehold on the city.” This radical “army” of “conquistadors” has “rolled over the police like Cortez rolling over the Aztecs.”",
            "Welcome to our world, out here in Seattle—at least according to the hosts and commentators of Fox News. Lesser voices on the digital right have announced even more dire supposed developments: “Rapper-turned-warlord rules commune streets with the iron fist of a privatized police force.” But it’s Fox that has been all over the story of the so-called Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone or CHAZ (which its Black Lives Matter organizers on Saturday renamed the Capitol Hill Organized Protest, CHOP): four-plus blocks of street and sidewalk in Seattle’s traditional gay and bohemian nightlife district, surrounding a boarded-up police precinct headquarters that the mayor ordered vacated last Monday to dampen a week-and-a-half of escalating confrontations between police and protesters. From there, the fluid protests, spearheaded by BLM but involving a wide spectrum of activists and ordinary citizens, coalesced with surprising rapidity into something like a provisional government. ",
            "What’s going on in these four blocks that shook the world is indeed an occupation, but it looks nothing like the conquista touted on Fox. It’s also the “block party” that Mayor Jenny Durkan has compared it to, to gleeful jeers from Fox commentators. And it’s other things as well—a protean, issue-focused but conceptually sprawling formative community, at once silly and serious, spontaneous and disciplined. Over the course of two evenings and an afternoon in the zone (plus a night observing a police/protest showdown there the week before), it seemed by turns like a commune (as in Paris 1871), an anarcho-syndicalist and small-L libertarian dream, a ’60s-style teach-in, a street fair and street market, a campout and weekend party, a poetry slam and pilgrimage, a school service day, a mass healing circle, a humbler urban version of Burning Man, and of course a protest rally.",
            "You’d hardly guess all that from the breathless attention Fox has lavished from Day One on this tiny strip of Seattle—while ignoring, among other peaceful protests, a 60,000-strong BLM march that proceeded in solemn silence through chilly rain and nearly no police presence on Saturday. The litany of elisions, misconceptions and misrepresentations that have spread from Fox’s coverage across social media and in the public and presidential minds may still surprise even those with diminished expectations of the network. ",
            "The most brazen have been visual. On Friday the Seattle Times revealed three sleights of the photo-editing hand on the Fox site, two of which it managed to preserve before the channel took them down. In one, Fox led a package of stories headlined “Crazy Town: Seattle helpless as armed guards patrol ‘autonomous zone’” with an incendiary photo of a man running between a burning car and building. That photo was actually taken May 30 in St. Paul, Minnesota. Seattle’s protests have produced no such blazes. ",
            "Fox also undertook two cut-and-pastes of a photo of a young sentinel standing calmly with a semiautomatic rifle on a quiet nighttime street in the zone, which it had already published intact. In one altered image, it set him in front of shattered storefront windows that had been photographed a week before CHAZ/CHOP was set up, more than a mile away. (Storefronts and windows have been spared in the autonomous/organized zone—even those in the vacated police station.) In the other, he stands by a street barrier and a hand-lettered sign reading, “You Are Now Entering Free Capitol Hill.” An editor’s note acknowledging the removal of the storefront mashup called it a “collage,” suggesting it was not intended to look like a single photo.",
            "Fox is also slippery in its verbal attributions. It has hammered at the idea that the CHOP has made neighbors alarmed and fearful. But the only purported “resident of this part of the city” it has presented is a “former Seattle City Council candidate” named Ari Hoffman, who said nothing about the neighborhood but inveighed against “domestic terrorists.” One problem: Hoffman, a familiar face on Fox, isn’t from Capitol Hill. He lives in Seward Park, an affluent neighborhood 4 miles away. And when a member of the Police Department’s African American Community Advisory Council told protesters they had “hijacked” the movement and “taken the meaning away,” a Fox headline, echoed in later coverage, blared something very different: “Black Lives Matter protesters say Seattle’s autonomous zone has hijacked message.”",
            "Such misrepresentations reverberate in subsequent reports and commentaries, painting a dark picture of the “organized protest” as illegitimate, divided, armed and violent. Many of these tropes derive from an on-camera statement Wednesday by Police Assistant Chief Deanna Nollette. “We’ve been hearing from community members that they have been subjected to barricades set up by the protesters with some armed individuals running them as checkpoints,” Nollette said, adding, “we have heard anecdotally of citizens and businesses being asked to pay a fee to operate within this area. This is the crime of extortion.” Nollette urged “anyone who feels threatened to call 911.”",
            "The next day, Police Chief Carmen Best walked back that statement, saying that only “rumors” and social media claimed extortion. At least one such claim is an evident fake. The Greater Seattle Business Association, which is based on Capitol Hill, checked with local businesses and “found no evidence of this occurring.” Detective Patrick Michaud, a Seattle Police spokesman, says the department has received no 911 calls or other complaints about extortion, intimidation, guns or checkpoint barriers in the CHAZ/CHOP.",
            "It’s understandable how the barriers around the zone—movable wood and plastic left behind by the police—and the hygienically masked sentinels standing at them could look intimidating to residents. But I passed through them perhaps a dozen times over three days and, like everyone I saw and talked to in the zone, was never stopped or asked my business. Even if this were the “border wall” Fox commentators call it, it would hardly be impenetrable; people could still come and go through the park abutting the zone.",
            "I chatted with one of the border guards, a slight young man of East Indian descent with a stick-on name tag reading “Elijah.” He lived in the suburbs, he said, and hadn’t joined in the protests. “I’d seen what the media said,” he explained. “I came out to see what it was like”—and wound up volunteering. The only disturbance he’s seen, he said, “was someone trying to pull the barriers apart. We asked her to stop.” Otherwise, he said, he was “surprised” how mellow it all was. “Some of the nicest people I’ve seen have been here.”",
            "The barriers, other guards explained, were there to stop cars from driving into the occupied streets—a real fear. Last Sunday, a motorist drove into the protest at that very intersection and shot a man point-blank who tried to make him stop, hitting his shoulder. He then charged through the crowd, gun in hand and surrendered to police. According to charging documents, he told police he was a security guard, his brother worked at the precinct, and he’d come to the protest “to see how bad it was,” with his Glock on the seat beside him. ",
            "Fox’s Vandana Rambaran reports, without details, that there have been “multiple shootings,” at the protests. Michaud says Seattle police have received no reports of shootings or guns at protests or in the occupied zone.",
            "There have been guns in the zone, however, at least in its first days (I never saw any in later days). The sentinels carrying them belong to a left wing gun rights and self-defense group called the Puget Sound John Brown Gun Club, which offers “support upon request to those in our communities targeted by white supremacists and other agents of oppression and exploitation.” ",
            "Mindi Welton-Mitchell, a pastor at Seattle’s Queen Anne Baptist Church, was at the “Interfaith Chaplain Table”—where Christian, Jewish and Muslim clergy offer counsel, masks and hand sanitizer—when two John Browners came by and identified themselves. Far from intimidating, she says, they were so inconspicuous, with their guns at their sides, “most people didn’t notice them.”",
            "Welton-Mitchell and the other minister at the table, Aaron Monts, saw unarmed barrier attendants deal with a man who approached “screaming and shouting” with a “Don’t Tread on Me” bath towel draped over his shoulders. “They moved him out without touching him,” Monts says. “One talked to him, heard what he had to say, and calmed him down. The de-escalation technique was superb.”",
            "Pastors and progressive gun-toters are just the start; just about every conceivable sort of volunteer has brought whatever she or he can offer. “We do not accept $ donations of any kind,” the No Cop Co-Op announces over tables heaped with groceries for anyone who wants them. Other ramshackle stalls and tables offer free clothes, battery charges (for tools and bikes as well as phones) and food, from camp-stove fry-ups to the enormous tureen of crab soup one Asian family ladles into disposable cups. The free books at the Chaz People’s Library and Mutual Aid Books tend to be crisp and movement-friendly. ",
            "Two women circulate with a handwritten sign offering mental-health help. Yes, they say when asked, we are certified therapists. Others circulate with garbage bags, darting at every scrap of litter. The trash cans are stuffed but I’ve never seen the street so clean.",
            "“This is the first time I’ve done this,” says 27-year-old Layla Lacos, standing behind a card table and a handwritten sign saying “Register to vote.” “But I believe passionately in voting.” She figured this might be a good place to enlist new voters, so she secured the necessary forms and a stash of “Vote/Vota” buttons from the county and ventured into the zone. Her hunch seems spot-on. “I just got here an hour ago and I’ve already signed up 30 or 40 registrations and address changes.” ",
            "Cash-free mutual aid hasn’t entirely dimmed the entrepreneurial spirit. Despite all the free food, people line up for $6 hot dogs at a commercial cart. A vendor stationed in the middle of the street does a land-office business in $30 Black Lives Matter T-shirts. ",
            "Jordan Lyon, an irrepressibly earnest and enthusiastic young community organizer, is fired up with a more social entrepreneurship. The day before, he brought down four folding chairs and a table, hung signs saying “Conversation Cafe: Let’s make a friend” and “Let’s talk about antiracism,” and wondered if anyone would sit down. Others brought more chairs and couches, until he had some 30 seats arranged in three circles. ",
            "All are now full, and the conversations hum. Some are confessional, testimonials to racism practiced and experienced. The circle I slip into looks toward broader solutions. A middle-aged African American man who says he works in “construction and performance art” urges the mutual investment that is a perennial, and perennially difficult, goal in black communities. “We need to do what they do in Chinatown,” he says. “Invest in business!” A fair-haired young woman, just graduated from the University of Georgia, wonders if what she learned in her Marxist-Leninist study group might be pertinent. Worlds collide, but gently. ",
            "“There is a level of trust here that is remarkable,” Lyon says, and I realize he’s talking not just about this conversation space but what he calls the surrounding “commons.” “I see this as potentially permanent. I would so love to see the Black Lives Matter Commons here—like Barcelona superblocks, like [car-banishing] Copenhagen, but about black culture.”",
            "Across the street in the park, other volunteers are planting literal roots. Someone has planted four chestnut seedlings, memorials to George Floyd and three local victims of police violence. (Alas, they’re too close together to reach full glory.) Four carefully plotted, compost-heaped vegetable gardens also have taken shape, suitably framed: “This Garden Is for Black and Indigenous Folks and their Plant Allies.” One lead gardener tempers his hopes, however. “I want it to be beautiful so it will look really bad when they tear it up.”",
            "On Pine Street, local black artists have laid down a blocklong “street mural” so beautiful and conspicuous officials may shrink from removing it, if they even want to. Seventeen-foot-high, meticulously drawn and painted letters, each by a different artist or team, spell out “Black Lives Matter” in styles by turns whimsical, geometric and symbolic. The project emulates similar new street art in Washington, D.C., and, especially, Charlotte, N.C.",
            "This mega-artwork symbolically reclaims embattled turf, ground zero for more than three decades in Seattle’s battles over class, power and race. The precinct headquarters was only located there in the early 1980s because of a community uproar; it was to go in the Central District, the pre-gentrification center of Seattle’s black community, a mile to the east, but activists there resisted. So the cop shop landed on Capitol Hill, where reaction was more muted, even welcoming.",
            "In the more turbulent ’90s and 2000s, however, things changed for the testier. Police confrontations with massed street kids and May Day protesters often turned violent. Rioting broke out in downtown Seattle, as elsewhere, in 1992 following the acquittal of the Los Angeles policemen who beat Rodney King, the first on-camera police violence to become a national sensation. Seattle police ill-advisedly pushed the rioters from downtown up Pine Street, where they scattered across Capitol Hill on a smashing and torching spree. The 1999 “Battle in Seattle,” when massive demonstrations shut down the World Trade Organization meeting, culminated on these same blocks as well. Demonstrators, many from the neighborhood, massed below the precinct building until police, backed by National Guard troops, drove them off with barrages of tear gas, flash bangs and rubber bullets. It became a battle for turf, just as the current occupation has. Chants “WTO must go!” gave way to “Get off our hill!”",
            "Now that long-simmering local history has come to a boil, precipitated by accumulated outrage at police violence and racial inequity. Everything converges here. Mayor Durkan is as besieged as the precinct building (and like the police, the target of profuse graffiti, the most printable of which proclaims “Impeach Jenny Durkan”). Protesters, and at least a third of Seattle’s left-leaning City Council, want her to resign. Her own police chief has publicly disputed her decision to evacuate the precinct. Critics on the right, including the Seattle Police Officers Guild’s firebrand president, call it craven capitulation. ",
            "That decision may look better in retrospect, however. It bought time, preventing further, perhaps catastrophic escalation and giving volatile demonstrations the chance to morph into orderly occupation. The name change announced Saturday signaled a further consolidation of the movement, although some media still managed to confuse the issue by calling the new CHOP the “Capitol Hill Occupied Protest.” As one of them explained, BLM organizers had no idea who slapped “CHAZ” on the project, but “Capitol Hill Organized Protest” makes it clear: “This is not an autonomous zone. We’re not trying to secede from the United States,” merely to have “our rights upheld.”",
            "An organized protest is one you can negotiate with. City officials, protest representatives and neighborhood business and property owners have begun talking about first steps: cooperating on safety and emergency services, trimming back the CHOP perimeter to let firetrucks and ambulances through. Much bigger issues remain: At a hundreds-strong “people’s assembly” outside the shuttered precinct station, I hear Nikkita Oliver, a charismatic former mayoral candidate and the most visible presence at CHOP public gatherings, lead the throng in a catechism of “core demands”: defund the police, release all arrested protesters, close the precinct. Kshama Sawant, the furthest-left member of our City Council, wants to turn the building into a community center. ",
            "Unlikely as that last measure may sound, there are precedents. Three hallowed Seattle institutions—the Northwest African American Heritage Museum, El Centro de la Raza, and the United Indians of All Tribes’ Daybreak Star Cultural Center—were born out of protest occupations, the first two of empty schools, the last of an obsolete army fort. ",
            "At the same time, the city has been steadily closing streets deemed unnecessary for auto traffic to create open pedestrian corridors. Pedestrians are already more dominant on Capitol Hill than in any other district.",
            "Perhaps a Black Lives Matter Commons isn’t so far-fetched."

        "body": [
            "The president’s executive order, set to be unveiled Tuesday, is designed to spur local reforms while drawing contrasts with liberal activists. ",
            "President Donald Trump hopes to acknowledge a nationwide uproar over police brutality while preventing rifts with police and other law enforcement groups integral to his political future. ",
            "With an executive order set to be unveiled at a White House event on Tuesday, the president is expected to lay out the case for the creation of a national database of police misconduct, so officers with a history of overly aggressive behavior cannot simply move to another department or state to escape scrutiny, according to a senior administration official. The order will also urge social workers and mental health professionals to work more closely alongside frontline officers. Finally, it will offer guidelines for new training and credentialing for police officers on de-escalating tense situations, and the best times to use force, according to the senior administration official, who said the goal of the order was not to demonize police officers. ",
            "The White House’s latest move, following weeks of protests in communities across the nation, has been crafted in close consultation with police officers, mayors, conservative African Americans, faith-based leaders and the families of victims, according to people familiar with the planning. Maintaining the political support of police — and appearing like a law-and-order president — has been a leading imperative for Trump’s top aides and political advisers as some liberal activists push to defund police departments and divert money to community programs. ",
            "In an unrelated White House event on Monday, Trump said the overall goal for the executive order is the desire to maintain “law and order” as well as “justice” and “safety.” “I think this will be very comprehensive,” Trump added, even as the exact details of the order were still being worked out.",
            "Trump aides and allies view policing as an area where Republicans can draw sharp contrasts with Democrats ahead of the general election. Part of that contrast is acknowledging the killing of George Floyd and several other innocent African Americans at the hands of what the White House views as rogue police officers. The approach is built on recommending tweaks to policing while leaving wholesale changes to mayors and other local government officials.",
            "“The reality is you have to respect our federalist system,” said Ken Blackwell, the former mayor of Cincinnati, former Ohio secretary of state and a longtime conservative leader and Trump supporter. “Safe streets cannot be guaranteed from the Oval Office or the governor’s mansion. That is local leadership.”",
            "The executive order will not allot any additional money for new training or the national database, but a senior administration official said police departments that undertake such credentialing will receive priority for federal grants. Additional money for training or police programs will have to come from legislation from Congress, another senior administration official said. Senate lawmakers may not proceed until sometime next month. ",
            "“The President is committed to making sure law enforcement has the resources and the respect they deserve to be able to do their job,” counselor to the president Kellyanne Conway said Monday on Fox News. “Somebody like the murderous cop in Minneapolis against George Floyd, he had more than a dozen complaints against him. The union is protecting him, he's eligible for a pension. It's all kind of things that can be done so we can ensure people are doing their job.”",
            "Top White House aides including senior adviser Jared Kushner, Ja’Ron Smith, chief of staff Mark Meadows and the acting director of the Domestic Policy Council Brooke Rollins spent the last week developing the executive order, along with Republican Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina. ",
            "They hoped to introduce policies that Democrats can also support, while leaving any major details for police reform to future legislation, said two people familiar with the internal discussions.",
            "“We are looking forward to tomorrow and for the president to have the opportunity to have a discussion where he has both police officers and police officer representatives in the room with families of people who were killed by police officers to have the discussion that the country needs to have so that we can turn the anger in this country right now into action,” said a senior administration official."

        "body": [
            "“Us waiting a month before we vote is a bad decision,\" said Sen. Tim Scott, who is leading the GOP's legislative push. ",
            "The Senate is unlikely to take up a police reform bill until after the Independence Day recess, Republican leaders said on Monday, raising the prospect that it could be a month or longer before a measure heads to President Donald Trump’s desk.",
            "A group of GOP senators, led by Tim Scott (R-S.C.), is expected to file legislation this week that would address policing practices in the aftermath of the May 25 killing of George Floyd, an unarmed African American, at the hands of Minneapolis police. But according to GOP leaders, any floor votes would likely have to wait until at least the week of July 20, after senators return from a two-week recess.",
            "“I think it has enough support if we can get a process to move it, possibly,” Senate Majority Whip John Thune (R-S.D.) said, referring to Scott’s bill. “But I would say at this moment probably unlikely in this work period — July, more likely.”",
            "Sen. Roy Blunt of Missouri, also a member of Republican leadership, concurred. He also said he does not think the two-week July 4 recess would be canceled.",
            "“I’d be surprised if it happens before the July recess,” Blunt said in a brief interview.",
            "Scott, for his part, said it would be a mistake to wait. He is urging Senate leaders to take swift action, on the heels of a “positive” phone call he had with Trump on Sunday night.",
            "“Without the bill becoming law — whether it’s my bill or some other version of some other bill — then we’ve kind of failed the moment,” Scott said. “Us waiting a month before we vote is a bad decision. So I hope we are willing to take up legislation and just get on the record. If it fails, it fails.”",
            "It remains unclear how the Senate will proceed, especially as GOP leaders grapple with whether to draw up another stimulus package to address the economic and public-health challenges presented by the coronavirus pandemic. ",
            "Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) reiterated on Monday that he will make a decision in July “about whether to go forward with a rescue package.” Expanded unemployment benefits expire on July 31, likely necessitating congressional action to aid out-of-work Americans this summer.",
            "Sen. James Lankford (R-Okla.), a member of Scott’s working group, noted that the Senate also has to pass the annual defense policy bill, presenting lawmakers with a busy calendar ahead of the August recess.",
            "“This is really not a moment where the country cares about partisanship on it. They want to just get it solved,” Lankford told reporters. “It’s hard to determine in a presidential election year because all the politics get pretty noisy as everyone tries to dig in.”",
            "Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming, another member of GOP leadership, said he was optimistic that both parties and both chambers could come to an agreement to address the racial injustices that have plagued the criminal justice system.",
            "“I expect a bill to become law,” Barrasso said. “I can’t tell you the timing on it, but the goal is to get this done.”",
            "House Democrats are scheduled to vote this week at the committee level on a sweeping police reform bill that has the backing of a wide swath of House and Senate Democrats. Republicans have expressed an openness to several provisions laid out in the proposal, but Scott’s plan — which is expected to be released on Wednesday — is expected to garner the backing of congressional Republicans in addition to the White House.",
            "McConnell said last week that he had tapped Scott, the lone African American Republican senator, to helm a police reform proposal to address “the obvious racial discrimination that we’ve seen on full display on our television screens over the last two weeks, and what is the appropriate response by the federal government.”",
            "Public opinion has swung sharply in favor of reforming the nation’s policing practices in recent days, amid a nationwide uproar over the police killings of Floyd in Minnesota and Breonna Taylor in McConnell’s home state of Kentucky.",
            "Scott’s plan, which is still in the works, would establish new reporting requirements on the use of deadly force by police officers and would threaten to cut off federal funding for localities that fail to comply.",
            "One of the outstanding issues includes whether to ban the use of chokeholds — a feature of the Democrat-authored proposal, but one that Republicans are hesitant to codify into law at the federal level. Scott’s plan would slash funding for police departments that do not ban the use of chokeholds.",
            "In addition to Lankford, Scott’s working group includes GOP Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, John Cornyn of Texas, Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia and Ben Sasse of Nebraska."

            "The president has remained adamant in his condemnation of athletes kneeling during the national anthem.",
            "Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Ben Carson suggested Monday he was working to tamp down President Donald Trump’s public displays of hostility toward professional athletes who kneel during the national anthem to protest police brutality and racial injustice in America.",
            "The remarks from Carson, the most prominent African American member of Trump’s administration, came in an interview with conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt, who asked the secretary whether there was “any chance you might persuade the president that he ought not to be upset with players” who take a knee at sporting events.",
            "“Well, I don’t think he has manifested as much animosity in that region lately,” Carson replied. “And I think we just continue to work him. He’ll get there.”",
            "The mass protests that have unfolded across the United States and around the world following the killing of George Floyd, a 46-year-old black man, by Minneapolis police last month have prompted a reconsideration of the peaceful form of activism led by Colin Kaepernick — the former NFL quarterback who knelt during the anthem as early as 2016.",
            "Although Kaepernick and other athletes who joined him in kneeling came under intense criticism from conservatives who claimed they were disrespecting the American flag, opposition to those players and various forms of protest has appeared to soften more recently as the country continues to grapple with a historic racial reckoning.",
            "The president, however, has remained adamant in his condemnation of kneeling during the anthem, lashing out last week at NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell after he acknowledged the league was “wrong for not listening” to players earlier and encouraged “all to speak out and peacefully protest.” ",
            "“Could it be even remotely possible that in Roger Goodell’s rather interesting statement of peace and reconciliation, he was intimating that it would now be O.K. for the players to KNEEL, or not to stand, for the National Anthem, thereby disrespecting our Country & our Flag?” Trump wrote on Twitter in response to Goodell’s video message.",
            "After U.S. Soccer’s board of directors voted last week to repeal the federation’s policy requiring players to stand during the anthem, Trump tweeted Saturday that he “won’t be watching much anymore!” The president went on to predict the NFL “is heading in that direction also, but not with me watching!”",
            "Carson similarly proposed Monday that perhaps the protests should come to an end — even as police killings of unarmed people of color and other instances of brutality gain focus — arguing that it was no longer necessary for athletes to kneel during the anthem because sufficient national attention had been brought to such issues.",
            "“I think most of them are kneeling because, you know, they want to protest some brutality in the police forces. They need to make that very clear,” he said. “And, of course, now that that has been brought to national attention, I’m not sure if it needs to continue.”"

            " (CNN)A jury of 15 people has been selected in Derek Chauvin's trial in the death of George Floyd. And while the jurors are unnamed and unseen on camera, we do know basic details about them.CNN's Brad Parks and Carma Hassan contributed to this report.",
            "Six men and nine women have been chosen to serve on the jury during the trial in Minneapolis. Of the 15 jurors, nine are White, four are Black and two are mixed race, according to how the court says the jurors identified themselves.",
            "The jury selection process began March 9 at the Hennepin County Government Center and wrapped up Tuesday, exactly two weeks later. The panel will ultimately be made up of 12 jurors and two alternates, so one of the selected jurors will be excused before the trial begins, Judge Peter Cahill said.",
            "Floyd, a 46-year-old Black man, died on May 25, 2020, after Chauvin, a White former Minneapolis Police officer, placed his knee on Floyd's neck for an extended period while Floyd pleaded, \"I can't breathe.\" His final moments were captured on video, and his death led to widespread protests against police brutality and racism under the banner Black Lives Matter as well as incidents of unrest and looting.",
            "Chauvin has pleaded not guilty to second-degree unintentional murder and second-degree manslaughter charges. He has also pleaded not guilty to third-degree murder, which was reinstated in the case on March 11.",
            "If convicted, Chauvin could face up to 40 years in prison for second-degree murder, up to 25 years for third-degree murder, and up to 10 years for second-degree manslaughter. The charges are to be considered separate, so Chauvin could be convicted of all, some or none of them.",
            "Opening statements are expected to start March 29, followed by testimony that could take about four weeks.",
            "Floyd family attorneys Ben Crump and Antonio Romanucci said in a statement they were pleased the jury had been set. \"After hearing the facts, we hope and expect the jury to deliver a just verdict,\" they said.",

            "The prospective jurors previously completed a 16-page questionnaire that asked for their personal thoughts on Black Lives Matter, policing and other topics. In court, each person was sworn in and then questioned one-by-one in a process known as voir dire. The juror's name, address and other information are kept anonymous.",
            "Eric Nelson questioned the prospective jurors for the defense, while Steve Schleicher questioned them for the prosecution.",
            "The first juror selected is a White man in his 20s or 30s who works as a chemist and said he has an analytical mind.",
            "The second juror is a woman of color who appears to be in her 20s or 30s, according to a pool reporter's observations in court. She said she was \"super excited\" about getting the jury questionnaire form.",
            "The third juror selected is a White man in his 30s who works as an auditor. He said he supports Black Lives Matter in the general context but doesn't like everything they have done.",
            "The fourth juror selected is a Black man in his 30s or 40s who moved to the US 14 years ago and works in information technology. He said that he had a \"somewhat negative\" opinion of Chauvin, that he strongly disagreed with defunding the police and that police make him feel safe.",
            "The fifth juror is a White woman in her 50s, according to the court.

She said she felt empathy for Floyd as well as the officers because \"at the end of the day I'm sure that the intention was not there for this to happen.\"",
            "The sixth juror chosen is a Black man in his 30s, according to the court, who said he had very favorable views of Black Lives Matter. He also said he thought Chauvin had \"no intention\" of harming anyone, but he said he could put that opinion aside in this case.",
            "The seventh juror selected is a White woman in her 50s, according to the court. She had a \"somewhat negative\" impression of Chauvin and wrote she \"got the impression he didn't care about\" Floyd.",

            "The ninth juror is a woman of multiple/mixed race in her 40s who said she has a \"somewhat negative\" opinion of Chauvin, but feels safe because of police in her neighborhood, the court said. The court initially incorrectly stated her race as White, but she identifies as multiple/mixed race.",
            "The 10th juror is a White woman in her 50s who works as a nurse. She said police in her community make her feel safe, but she noted Black and minority people are not always treated fairly in the criminal justice system.",
            "The 11th juror is a Black woman and grandmother in her 50s or 60s who once lived about 10 blocks from where Floyd died. She has a relative that is a Minneapolis Police officer, and said she somewhat agrees that Black people are not always treated fairly in the criminal justice system.",

            "The 13th juror is a White woman in her 50s. Until recently, she worked in customer service in a suburban business that was damaged in the unrest after Floyd's death.

She grew up three blocks from the square but had left Minneapolis for college, and made her life with a career in faith and race relations. When Floyd was killed her mother told her to come home, that they needed her, that she had the tools and experience in civil rights to help her community heal.",

            "The grief is fresh, too, not only caused by what happened to Floyd on Memorial Day 2020. Just last weekend a man was shot to death not far from the spot where Floyd once laid motionless. Police did not respond to CNN's request for comment, but a spokesman told USA Today they faced interference when trying to come into the square that Saturday night.

            "Austin said residents were happy to work with emergency medical services, but police were not welcome in what some are calling an \"autonomous zone,\" though officers have attended several incidents in the area in the 10 months since Floyd's death. On Friday night, a half dozen police cars came through the square, lights flashing in a slow moving chase. Gang warfare is prevalent here, dating back long before Floyd died.",

            "Briggs, a White man, has lived in this racially mixed neighborhood since the early 1990s and says he loves the community. ",
            "He's part of the volunteer team that tends to the memorial each day. And each day he updates an old gas station sign that used to show prices per gallon to indicate how many days the court has been sitting in the murder trial of former officer Derek Chauvin.",

            "The city says it intends to reopen the streets to traffic. It was the city that first installed the concrete barriers last May to protect people from traffic as thousands of mourners and protesters descended on the square to pay their respects. Last month officials determined it was time to remove the barricades, and the mayor has said that would likely happen after the Chauvin trial is completed.",
            "It won't happen without a fight. Some activists, residents and caretakers of the square say they have sent 24 demands to the city they believe would create a pathway to restorative justice and healing if and when the blockade goes. They say not one has been met yet.",
            "Their list included youth centers, long term community investment, integrated health services, among many other items they wanted the city's help to fund and nurture.",
            "For 10 months Austin has dedicated her days to collecting and preserving every single offering to the memorial in memory of Floyd. There are boxes and boxes of items from cut flowers, to children's drawings, to a Roberta Flack record. Each is treated as sacred and preserved as a priceless piece of art.",
            "\"We are keepers of the stories of the thousands of people who have come through here to actually lay down their offering as a creative expression of pain and hope,\" she said. \"If you lift those barriers without first providing restorative justice to the community people are going to forget about the harm and trauma caused to the community. The community will never see any kind or form of restorative justice.\"",
            "The start of the trial has brought both hope and trepidation.",
            "Some residents are nervous about the outcome and what that might mean to their neighborhood. Business owners starved of drive-through traffic by the barricades and the pandemic want the traffic flow. At the same, they are stressed about more potential unrest.",
            "As jury selection proceeded last week, the square saw mothers with children, White men in suits, and Black couples come to pay their respects all at the same time.",
            "But like the women playing Double Dutch, sometimes it is impossible not to get tangled up. In the south Minneapolis neighborhood where Floyd took his last breaths, the tangle of issues that need to be solved is a microcosm of the situation facing many urban American neighborhoods, long before the world ever heard of George Floyd."

            "Chauvin already faced charges of second-degree unintentional murder and second-degree manslaughter. He has pleaded not guilty to all three charges.",
            "The added charge provides prosecutors a third potential pathway to conviction in the closely watched case, which began Tuesday with jury selection at the heavily fortified Hennepin County Government Center.",
            "\"The charge of 3rd-degree murder, in addition to manslaughter and felony murder, reflects the gravity of the allegations against Mr. Chauvin,\" Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said in a statement. \"We look forward to presenting all three charges to the jury.\"",
            "Attorneys Ben Crump and Antonio Romanucci said in a statement Thursday night that they are \"gratified\" the judge has included a third-degree murder charge.",
            "\"The trial is very painful and the family needs closure. We're pleased that all judicial avenues are being explored and that the trial will move forward,\" the statement read.",
            "Chauvin was initially charged with third-degree murder in the days after Floyd's May 2020 death, but Hennepin County District Court Judge Peter Cahill dismissed the count in October, saying it did not apply to this case.",
            "However, an appeals court ruling in February in the case against former Minneapolis Police officer Mohamed Noor opened the door to reinstating the charge against Chauvin, and the state subsequently filed an appeal of Cahill's ruling.",
            "The Minnesota Court of Appeals ordered Cahill to reconsider the motion to reinstate the charge last week. On Wednesday, the Minnesota Supreme Court refused a request by Chauvin's attorney to block the appellate court's decision, clearing the way for Cahill to reinstate the charge.",
            "In court on Thursday, Chauvin's defense attorney Eric Nelson argued that Noor's case was factually and procedurally different than Chauvin's interactions with Floyd, in which he knelt on Floyd's head and neck area for an extended period. However, prosecutors argued that the judge was bound to follow the appeals court's precedent in Noor.",
            "Judge Cahill ruled Thursday morning that he accepted the appeals court's ruling that the opinion in Noor's case immediately set a precedent, and he ruled to reinstate the charge.",
            "He added that the third-degree murder charge only applied to Chauvin and that the potential to reinstate the charge for the three other officers charged in Floyd's death will be addressed at a later date.",
            "What the charges mean",
            "Third-degree murder, sometimes known as \"depraved mind\" or \"depraved heart\" murder, generally applies to a case in which a person does something eminently dangerous to others without regard for human life, such as randomly firing into a crowd or driving on the wrong side of the road.",
            "The second-degree murder charge alleges that Chauvin unintentionally caused Floyd's death while committing third-degree assault, and the second-degree manslaughter charge alleges that Chauvin caused Floyd's death by his \"culpable negligence.\"",
            "If convicted, Chauvin could face up to 40 years in prison for second-degree murder, up to 25 years for third-degree murder, and up to 10 years for second-degree manslaughter.",
            "The charges are to be considered separate, so Chauvin could be convicted of all, some or none of them.",
            "David Weinstein, a former prosecutor who has closely followed the case, said that the charges each represent a different level of intent, so jurors will have more options to consider during deliberations.",
            "\"Choices like this can also allow for a compromise verdict by the jury,\" he said. \"The defense would have preferred an all or nothing choice for jurors.\"",
            "How we got here",
            "Floyd's final moments were captured on disturbing police and bystander video, and his death led to unrest and fires in the city as well as worldwide protests against police brutality and racism. All four officers involved were fired and charged in Floyd's death. Chauvin is being tried separately due to coronavirus-related limits on courtroom space.",
            "The charge of third-degree murder was most recently used in the murder trial of former officer Noor. He was convicted of the charge after prosecutors said he fired his gun at a person outside of his squad car's window, killing Justine Ruszczyk and endangering his own partner.",
            "In October, Judge Cahill dropped the third-degree murder charge against Chauvin, ruling the charge can \"be sustained only in situations in which the defendant's actions were 'eminently dangerous to other persons' and were not specifically directed at the particular person whose death occurred.\"",
            "The evidence presented by the state does not show that Chauvin's actions were \"eminently dangerous\" to anyone but Floyd, he wrote at the time.",
            "In Noor's case, though, an appeals court ruled that third-degree murder can be applied to instances in which a person applies force to a single person.",
            "Given that ruling, Ellison filed a motion last month asking a district court judge to reinstate the charge, saying that Noor's sentencing set a new precedent. Appellate court Judge Michelle Larkin agreed, writing that the district court \"erred\" in denying the state's motion to reinstate the charge in light of the Noor opinion."

            "\"No matter what a potential juror has seen or heard, can they set that aside and base their decision on evidence in court and the law the judge gives them?\" said Mary Moriarty, the former chief Hennepin County public defender.",

If the defense or prosecution believes the person cannot be impartial in the case, they can ask the court to dismiss the person for cause. Each side has unlimited challenges for cause.",
            "Prosecutors and defense attorneys can also move to dismiss prospective jurors without cause using what's called a peremptory challenge. Chauvin's team has 15 of these challenges and the prosecution has nine, according to the court. These peremptory challenges can themselves be challenged, though, if they are based on race, ethnicity or sex -- known as a Batson challenge.",
            "The process continues until the court decides on 14 people -- split into 12 jurors and two alternates, Hennepin County Court Director of Communications Spenser Bickett told CNN. ",
            "Who's who in the trial",
            "George Floyd, 46, was born in North Carolina and raised in Houston and moved to Minnesota as an adult for a fresh start, working as security at a restaurant.",
            "On May 25, 2020, police were called about a man who had used a $20 counterfeit bill at a Minneapolis store. Officers were directed to a parked car with Floyd in the driver's seat, and they handcuffed him and moved to put him into the back of a police car, according to the amended complaint.",
            "Two other officers, including Chauvin, then responded to the scene and struggled to get Floyd into the vehicle, the complaint states. Chauvin allegedly pulled Floyd to the ground in a prone position and placed his knee on Floyd's neck and head. His knee remained there even as Floyd pleaded, \"I can't breathe,\" said \"I'm about to die\" and ultimately stopped breathing, the complaint says. He was pronounced dead at a hospital shortly after.",
            "The Hennepin County Medical Examiner's autopsy listed the cause of death as heart failure \"complicating law enforcement subdual, restraint, and neck compression,\" and ruled it a homicide. The medical examiner also noted arteriosclerotic and hypertensive heart disease; fentanyl intoxication; and recent methamphetamine use as \"other significant conditions.\"",
            "Medical examiners hired by Floyd's family also ruled it a homicide but said Floyd died of \"asphyxiation from sustained pressure\" during the arrest.",
            "Derek Chauvin, 44, had been an officer with the Minneapolis Police Department since 2001 until he was fired in the wake of Floyd's death. He was the subject of at least 18 prior complaints, two of which were \"closed with discipline,\" according to a department internal affairs public summary.",
            "A motion to dismiss the charges filed last August previewed his possible defense. In that filing, his attorney argued that Chauvin had no intent to harm Floyd while restraining him, that he was acting within police policy, and that Floyd's cause of death was the result of a drug overdose and other existing health issues.",
            "Thomas Lane, J. Alexander Kueng and Tou Thao, all former Minneapolis Police officers, were also on scene with Chauvin and are charged with aiding and abetting second-degree murder and aiding and abetting second-degree manslaughter. They have pleaded not guilty.",
            "Due to limits on courtroom space because of the pandemic, their joint trial was moved to this summer. They will not testify in Chauvin's trial, but their names, statements and actions will be heavily featured.",
            "Eric Nelson is Chauvin's defense attorney and will represent him at trial. He is part of the Halberg Criminal Defense practice and has worked exclusively in criminal defense since being admitted to the bar, according to his online bio.",
            "Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison's office says the three main presenting prosecution attorneys are Jerry Blackwell, Matthew Frank and Steve Schleicher.",
            "Peter Cahill is the Hennepin County judge overseeing the case. He was first appointed to the bench in 2007 and has been reelected to the position three times since, most recently last November.",
            "An explanation of the charges",
            "Chauvin is charged with second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter.",
            "The second-degree unintentional murder charge alleges that Chauvin killed Floyd \"without intent\" while he committed or attempted to commit felony third-degree assault, which is defined as inflicting \"substantial\" bodily harm. The charge is punishable by up to 40 years in prison.",
            "The third-degree murder charge alleges that Chauvin caused Floyd's death \"by perpetrating an act eminently dangerous to others and evincing a depraved mind, without regard for human life.\" The charge is punishable by up to 25 years in prison.",
            "The second-degree manslaughter charge alleges that Chauvin caused Floyd's death by \"his culpable negligence, creating an unreasonable risk and consciously took the chances of causing death or great bodily harm.\" \"Culpable negligence\" is essentially a heightened form of ordinary negligence, Moriarty explained. The charge is punishable by up to 10 years in prison.",
            "How the pandemic changed the trial",
            "The possibility of a courtroom Covid-19 outbreak looms, so the court has taken a number of steps to prevent one.",
            "Everyone who attends the Chauvin trial will be required to distance from others and wear a mask, although witnesses and attorneys may remove their masks during testimony and other court statements. Plexiglass has been installed around the courtroom as well.",
            "In addition, the trial will be livestreamed for those not able to attend, a first for a Minnesota criminal trial.",
            "Only one member of Floyd's family and Chauvin's family will be allowed to attend the trial because of the Covid-19 restrictions. For each family, a different family member can rotate through that in-court position with appropriate credentials, the judge ruled.",
            "During the trial, the jurors will be partially sequestered during the day but will be allowed to return to their homes at night. They will be fully sequestered during deliberations.",
            "How police are preparing",
            "Given the unrest and looting that ensued when Floyd died, local and state authorities are taking major security measures. The Hennepin County Government Center is now surrounded by fencing and barricades, and the building will be empty aside from those participating in Chauvin's trial and approved staff.",
            "Mayor Jacob Frey said the city is preparing for potential unrest with \"painstaking detail.\" He said up to 2,000 National Guard members will be prepared to respond along with up to 1,100 law enforcement pooled from 12 other jurisdictions. ",
            "\"Safety is a top priority through this very difficult time in our city,\" Frey said last month. \"There's great frustration, there's anxiety, and there's trauma. We anticipate that trauma increasing as we get closer to jury deliberations.\" ",
            "Minnesota law enforcement leaders last month outlined their plan to work together to provide security during the trial in what they called \"Operation Safety Net.\"",
            "State Patrol Col. Matt Langer said the goal is to protect lawful protests and demonstrations while preventing violence, property damage, fires and looting.",
            "\"Planning for this operation occurred starting back in July,\" Langer said. \"It occurred in earnest all summer.\"",
            "Operation Safety Net is organized into four phases, according to Langer: (1) Planning and preparation, (2) jury selection; (3) closing arguments, deliberations and a verdict; and (4) demobilization. ",
            "Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo said the unified command will help everyone stay on the same page.",
            "\"It will allow all of us to be able to respond metro and region wide, if needed, and it will allow great cooperation coordination and communication,\" he said.",
            "Minnesota Department of Public Safety Commissioner John Harrington said last month the actions were all precautionary.",
            "\"As of right now, we do not have any current, actionable intelligence about groups planning to come here to disrupt the trial or to cause disorder,\" Harrington said. \"We are exercising this unified command out of caution.\""

            "The poll was conducted March 1 and 2 and based on a nationally representative sample of 1,165  people ages 18 and older. The poll findings come just days before the one-year anniversary of Breonna Taylor's death in Louisville, Kentucky. ",
            "When asked about Floyd's death, 64% of Black people described it as a murder, according to the poll. Among White respondents, 28% described it as murder and 33% said \"it was negligence on part of the officer.\" ",
            "Clifford Young, president of public affairs in the United States for Ipsos, said the contrast in responses extends to nearly every question in the survey.",
            "\"Black Americans, for instance, and minorities in general are still super focused on this issue. It hasn't gone away. It can't go away because they live with it every day,\" Young said. ",
            "USA Today/Ipsos conducted a similar poll in June as protests condemning police brutality took place across the United States. Last year, 60% of all respondents described Floyd's death as murder. That number dropped to 36% in the latest poll.",
            "Floyd, a 46-year-old Black man, died on May 25, 2020, after Chauvin placed his knee on Floyd's neck for nearly eight minutes while Floyd pleaded, \"I can't breathe.\" His death sparked a worldwide movement and America became the epicenter of a racial reckoning.",
            "In the months that followed, people protested in the streets and headed to the polls with Black, Latino and Native Americans voters flipping some states blue during the presidential election. ",
            "More recently, critics saw White privilege in the police response to the US Capitol insurrectionists compared to the response to protests over Floyd's death.",
            "After months of racial reckoning, views over whether race relations have changed are also divided.",
            "Overall, more Americans (47%) believe race relations have neither improved nor worsened in the past year, the poll shows. But 40% said they feel race relations actually worsened and only 13% said they had improved.",
            "Among Black Americans, 54% say race relations have worsened in the past year, while 10% believe they have improved. But more White Americans (51%) feel they have neither improved nor worsened and 35% said they have worsened, according to the poll.",
            "Young said researchers were surprised by the results of the poll, which, he says, shows that racial justice is no longer \"front and center\" in many people's minds, especially for those who are not impacted daily.",
            "\"It's disheartening,\" Young said.",
            "\"What was very clear for us is that when it comes to racial justice issues, it's sort of 'out of sight, out of mind' for most Americans,\" he added. \"In other words, either there's an acute problem like the George Floyd killing that brings to the forefront the issue and everyone pays attention, but if not, it's sort of recede in the memory and people focus on other things.\""

            "In Paris, anti-mask rallies in August drew only a few hundred people with marginally larger demonstrations in Brussels, Dublin, Madrid, Rome, Rotterdam and Zurich – protests occurred even in Italy, where Covid-19 took an exceptionally high toll. Anti-maskers have accused governments of manipulating people through fear and claim there is no scientific justification for making them mandatory.",
            "In the United States, anti-lockdown demonstrators and supporters of President Donald Trump – who himself has consistently played down the severity of the virus – joined forces to protect what they claimed was an assault on individual rights, despite skyrocketing infections that would eventually catapult the country to the top of global mortality rates. In some states protesters stormed government offices while in Michigan a group of men were accused of plotting to kidnap Governor Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat who had become a lightning rod for anger over coronavirus measures.",
            "By April nationwide protests spiked after a series of tweets from President Trump on April 17, urging Americans in states where leaders had imposed restrictions to “liberate” themselves. Critics have blamed Trump, who has refused lockdowns and other anti-virus interventions, for fomenting the movement.",

            "The death in police custody of George Floyd, a 44-year-old African-American man, on May 25 in Minneapolis sparked a wave of anti-racism protests in the US and around the world. Video images shared on social media showed Floyd being held down, a policeman's knee on his neck, as he repeatedly pleaded for air before he died.",
            "“I can’t breathe,” Floyd’s last words, were brandished on protest signs. It was not the first time a Black man had died at the hands of US police while pleading for air. \"I can't breathe\" has been chanted at protests against racism among police ever since the 2014 death of Eric Garner, who was filmed repeating those words as he was restrained by an NYPD officer.",
            "Just two months before Floyd’s death, Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old health worker, was shot dead by police during a botched raid on her apartment. The police were looking for a suspect who did not live at Taylor's residence. A new round of protests calling for justice for Taylor erupted in September when a grand jury ruled against convicting the officers involved in her death.",
            "These and other incidents revived the US Black Lives Matter movement and the #BLM hashtag that first surfaced in 2013. Across the US, more than 4,700 demonstrations waved the BLM banner with protests against Floyd’s death peaking on June 6, when half a million people turned out in nearly 550 locations across the country.",
            "Outrage against police also spilled onto the streets of Paris, where Floyd’s death shined a new spotlight on the case of Adama Traoré, a 24-year-old Black man who died in 2016 after being restrained by French police. His sister, Assa, led several anti-racism protests in which young and old, Black and White, working-class and middle-class were united in their calls for justice for Traoré. In June more than 10,000 gathered in Paris with demonstrations also taking place in Marseille, Lille and Lyon.",
            "In cities as far-flung as Sydney and Melbourne people also marched to highlight high rates of incarceration and deaths in custody among Aboriginal Australians.",
            "Anti-racism activists expanded their message, pointing to the lingering injustices due to the legacies of slavery and colonialism. Others took matters directly into their hands by defiling or pulling down statues of historical figures who profited from or supported the slave trade. In the UK and the US establishments like bars and pubs went so far as to change their names in a sign of solidarity with the BLM movement.",

            "Women precipitated the largest anti-government protests ever seen in Belarus after a contested presidential vote on August 9 saw the re-election of President Alexander Lukashenko, who has been in power since 1994. The opposition and its supporters have called on Lukashenko to quit, denouncing the election as rigged and keeping up demonstrations with as many 100,000 thronging the city of Minsk.",
            "Solidarity for the opposition remains strong even as leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya is in exile in Lithuania. But despite EU sanctions and international calls for democracy to be upheld little has changed",
            "More than 30,000 people are believed to have been arrested in Belarus since mass protests began, many facing fines or even lengthy prison sentences. Protests are now a fixture on the calendar for Belarus’s beleaguered pro-democracy movement and they show no signs of lifting the pressure on Lukashenko’s regime.",

            "Muslim voices rose in protest against French President Emmanuel Macron in October after he defended the secular values (laïcité) of the French Republic, denouncing Islamist extremism and vowing not to give up the \"right\" to caricature.",
            "At a ceremony honouring school teacher Samuel Paty, who was murdered by a Chechen Islamist who was outraged that Paty showed students caricatures of the Prophet Mohammed during a class on freedom of expression, Macron hailed Paty as a hero for representing the free-thinking values of the French Republic, including the right to mock religion.",
            "\"I can understand that people could be shocked by the caricatures but I will never accept that violence can be justified,\" Macron later said in a speech.",
            "Anger and outrage at his comments erupted in the Middle East and parts of Asia. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan called for a boycott of French goods, questioned Macron's mental health and said he had a problem with Muslims – prompting France to recall its ambassador.",
            "Effigies of the French president along with the French flag were burned as protesters amassed in their thousands in Pakistan, Lebanon, Palestinian Territories and Afghanistan and elsewhere in the Muslim world.",
            "Macron’s government was again accused of Islamophobia after it unveiled new laws against \"Islamist separatism\" on October 2. Macron triggered more scorn by declaring Islam to be a religion \"in crisis all over the world” and said the religion could instead be remade into “an Islam of the Enlightenment”.",
            "When the UK’s Financial Times published an opinion piece on November 3 that argued Macron’s words were alienating Muslims in France, the president challenged the piece, saying it contained factual errors. Macron then launched a broader attack on the Anglophone press that included the New York Times and sought to placate Muslims by explaining that France was fighting radical Islamism and not Islam itself.",
            "His tough tone have led some to speculate that Macron is already in campaign mode ahead of a 2022 presidential election, with his hardened stance a possible attempt to lure votes from far-right leader Marine le Pen.",

Their cause has now been taken up by US Black Lives Matter co-founder Opal Tometi, Greta Thunberg and even singer Alicia Keys, who are among a coterie of international celebrities to sign an open letter to Buhari for the release of the activists.

            "Tens of thousands of women, and men, poured onto the streets in a string of nationwide rallies in repudiation of the changes – and in defiance of a Covid-19 ban on mass gatherings. Holding up signs bearing a red lightning bolt they chanted the slogan, “I think, I feel, I decide” in a message that resonated with women around the world.",
            "The anti-abortion protests were among Poland’s largest in decades, not seen since the Solidarity movement of the 1980s that led to the collapse of the Soviet government.",
            "But others have also joined the fray – from farmers to entrepreneurs – swelling protesters’ ranks and coalescing around a common goal of overthrowing the government.",

Trump supporters rallied to cries of “Stop the Count” and “Stop the Steal” outside voting centres in multiple cities during regular weekend protests throughout November, at times facing off against Biden supporters who called for every vote to be counted.",
            "pic.twitter.com/4lH5PZRI9C",
            "On November 14 the post-election protests peaked with a \"MAGA March\" in Washington, DC. Just five blocks from the White House, thousands of pro-Trump and anti-Trump protesters brawled, some armed with batons, before riot police used stun guns and teargas to disperse the crowds. Several arrests were made and one person was stabbed.",
            "Another flashpoint occurred when a pro-Trump group, Women for America First, organised a rally in the capital on December 12, when disparate groups coalesced and clashed with opponents in yet another worrying show of a profoundly divided United States. A White nationalist group known as the Proud Boys, members of the religious far-right and grassroots MAGA (Make America Great Again) groups were all in Washington in overlapping protests in support of Trump. Scuffles ensued when Black Lives Matter (BLM) demonstrators and \"antifa\" (leftist anti-fascist groups), exchanged insults with members of the Proud Boys. Four people were stabbed and several were arrested.",

            "Protesters demonstrated in Paris and other French cities throughout much of November and December against a new security law proposed by the government that would have limited the right to share images of on-duty police online. Offenders would face up to one year in prison and a €45,000 ($53,000) fine.",
            "The government said the proposal was intended to protect police from retribution and online calls for violence against officers. But critics warned the bill would curtail the right to document police misconduct and undermine the ability of journalists to cover police activity, notably at demonstrations.",
            "Reporters without Borders, Amnesty International's France division and journalist unions called for the provision to be withdrawn. The UN’s High Commissioner for Human Rights and France’s own human rights ombudsman also voiced concerns that the provision – Article 25 – threatened fundamental civil rights.",
            "The importance of documenting police activity was underscored in late November when Black music producer Michel Zecler was brutally beaten by Paris police hurling racial epithets. Videos of the attack were first published by French website Loopsider but quickly went viral, receiving millions of views. An investigation into the incident is ongoing. “I was lucky enough to have videos, which protected me,” Zecler later said.",
            "On November 30 the government backed down, dropping controversial Article 25 and saying that it would be “completely rewritten”.",
            "Despite the reversal, almost 100 protests took place throughout France on December 5. In some cities, demonstrators clashed with police as vehicles were set on fire and shop windows were smashed. More than 140 people were arrested at protests the following week and police used water cannon to disperse crowds."

            "The civil settlement was substantial and relatively quick, reflecting the public pressure and emotion surrounding the case of the 26-year-old, which became a rallying cry for the Black Lives Matter movement.",
            "After Taylor's death on March 13, another black citizen, George Floyd, died on May 25 in Minneapolis while a police officer knelt on his neck, sparking protests across the country against racism and police brutality.",

            "In the wake of the killings, Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers authorized the deployment of 500 members of the National Guard to Kenosha, doubling the number of troops. The governor’s office said he is working with other states to bring in additional National Guard members and law officers. Authorities also announced a 7 p.m. curfew, an hour earlier than the night before.",
            "“A senseless tragedy like this cannot happen again,” the governor, a Democrat, said in a statement. “I again ask those who choose to exercise their First Amendment rights please do so peacefully and safely, as so many did last night. I also ask the individuals who are not there to exercise those rights to please stay home and let local first responders, law enforcement and members of the Wisconsin National Guard do their jobs.”",
            "In Washington, the Justice Department said it is sending in more than 200 federal agents from the FBI, U.S. Marshals Service and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives in response to the unrest. The White House said up to 2,000 National Guard troops would be made available.",

He shot someone!’ And everyone is trying to fight the guy, chasing him and then he started shooting again.”",
            "Scott said he cradled a lifeless victim in his arms, and a woman started performing CPR, but “I don’t think he made it.”",
            "According to witness accounts and video footage, police apparently let the gunman walk past them and leave the scene with a rifle over his shoulder and his hands in the air as members of the crowd were yelling for him to be arrested because he had shot people.",
            "As for how the gunman managed to slip away, Sheriff David Beth depicted a chaotic, high-stress scene, with lots of radio traffic and people screaming, chanting and running — conditions he said can cause “tunnel vision” among law officers.",
            "Rittenhouse was assigned a public defender in Illinois for a hearing Friday on his transfer to Wisconsin. The public defender’s office had no comment. Under Wisconsin law, anyone 17 or older is treated as an adult in the criminal justice system.",

However, video taken before the shooting shows police tossing bottled water from an armored vehicle to what appear to be armed civilians walking the streets. And one of them appears to be the gunman.",
            "“We appreciate you being here,” an officer is heard saying to the group over a loudspeaker.",
            "Before the shooting, the conservative website The Daily Caller conducted a video interview with the suspected gunman in front of a boarded-up business.",
            "“So people are getting injured, and our job is to protect this business,” the young man said. “And part of my job is to also help people. If there is somebody hurt, I’m running into harm’s way. That’s why I have my rifle—because I can protect myself, obviously. But I also have my med kit.”",
            "Sam Dirks, 22, from Milwaukee, said he had seen the gunman earlier in the evening, and he was yelling at some of the protesters. “He was definitely very agitated. He was pacing around, just pointing his gun in general. Not necessarily at anyone specifically,” Dirks said.",

            "In Wisconsin, it is legal for people 18 and over to openly carry a gun, with no license required.",
            "Witness accounts and video indicate the shootings took place in two stages: The gunman first shot someone at a car lot, then jogged away, fell in the street, and opened fire again as members of the crowd closed in on him.",
            "A witness, Julio Rosas, 24, said that when the gunman stumbled, “two people jumped onto him and there was a struggle for control of his rifle. At that point during the struggle, he just began to fire multiple rounds, and that dispersed people near him.”",
            "“The rifle was being jerked around in all directions while it was being fired,” Rosas said.",
            "Blake, 29, was shot in the back seven times on Sunday as he leaned into his SUV, three of his children seated inside. Kenosha police have said little about what happened other than that they were responding to a domestic dispute.",
