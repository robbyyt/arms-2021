    "A jury pool has been appointed in the case of the ex-Minneapolis police officer accused of killing George Floyd, an unarmed black man, last year.A total of 15 jurors have been selected for Derek Chauvin's trial after weeks of proceedings involving both prosecutors and the defence team.Mr Chauvin, 44, is accused of unintentional murder and manslaughter in the 25 May, 2020 death of Mr Floyd.Arguments will begin on 29 March, with 14 of the jurors seated.Jurors for the case, for which race has been at the centre, include three black men, one black woman, two white men, five white women and two multiracial women, according to the court. Their identities will remain anonymous for their safety.Hennepin County Judge Peter Cahill said on Tuesday that he would not release the rest of the jury pool until the 14 selected jurors are officially sworn in on 29 March.Mr Chauvin was the Minneapolis officer filmed kneeling on Mr Floyd's neck for over seven minutes in a video that sparked protests over racial inequalities worldwide.He faces a maximum penalty of 40 years in prison for the second-degree murder and manslaughter charges. A third-degree murder charge, with a maximum penalty of 25 years, was also reinstated earlier this month.Analysis by Tara McKelvey, BBC News Of the dozens of people I interviewed in Minneapolis, they all the same opinion on one issue: seating a jury would be hard. Beyond that, opinions varied; some believed the trial would be fair; others saw it as a sham. Regarding the issue of jury selection, they had good reasons for concern: the makeup of the jury lies at the heart of the matter, and will determine whether the trial is fair. Too often, US juries have skewed towards white people, and the selection of the jurors has been biased. Local demographics also posed challenges, as the state is 80% white, but most believed the jury should represent a more diverse group. The final group - nine white jurors, four Black jurors, and two who describe themselves as multiracial - embodies a diverse mix, and may help instil faith that the jury selection, and the trial itself, so far, appears to be just. Mr Chauvin is accused of unintentional second-degree murder as well as third-degree murder. Experts say the latter charge is easier to prove. To convict on a second-degree murder charge, prosecutors must prove that a serious assault had been committed by Mr Chauvin, and that it was a \"substantial causal factor\" in Mr Floyd's death. For third-degree murder, the jury must be convinced that Mr Chauvin showed a reckless disregard for human life, but not that the assault led to death. He has also been accused of second-degree manslaughter, which requires prosecutors to show Mr Chauvin created an \"unreasonable risk\" of death or bodily harm to another.Mr Chauvin is standing trial separately from the other three police officers involved in Mr Floyd's arrest. These three will come before the courts in August, charged with aiding and abetting second-degree murder.It is rare for police officers in the US to be charged - or convicted - for use of lethal force. On the evening of 25 May 2020, Mr Floyd was apprehended by police after a convenience store employee accused him of using a counterfeit bill to purchase a pack of cigarettes. He was handcuffed, but when officers tried to put him into the squad car he resisted, and a struggle ended with Mr Floyd face down on the street.Onlookers then filmed Mr Chauvin, 44, kneeling on Mr Floyd's head and neck. In the recorded footage, Mr Floyd can be heard saying he could not breathe more than 20 times before he is seen going limp.The 46-year-old was pronounced dead in hospital an hour later. Earlier this month, the city of Minneapolis agreed to pay a $27m (£19m) settlement to Mr Floyd's family - the largest ever awarded in the state.",
    "A Minnesota judge overseeing the case against ex-policeman Derek Chauvin has declined to move the high profile murder trial away from Minneapolis.Lawyers for Mr Chauvin, who is accused of killing unarmed black man George Floyd, argued he could not receive a fair trial after a settlement was paid by the city to Mr Floyd's family.Judge Peter Cahill called the timing of the $27m (£19m) payout \"unfortunate\" but said it should not delay the case.Jury selection is continuing this week.Mr Floyd's death, after being held under the knee of Mr Chauvin, was captured on camera and led to racial justice protests around the world.Twelve jurors have been selected, and two more are needed as alternates. According to the court, six are white, four jurors are black and two are multiracial.Judge Cahill did dismiss two jurors earlier this week who had heard of the settlement and had said it could affect their impartiality. Trial arguments are due to begin 29 March.Eric Nelson, who is representing Mr Chauvin, had argued that the wrongful death settlement paid to Mr Floyd's family last week had unfairly tainted the jury pool.But the judge determined that moving the case away from Minneapolis would not necessarily lead to a more impartial jury.\"I don't think there's any place in the state of Minnesota that has not been subjected to extreme amounts of publicity in this case,\" Judge Cahill said in his ruling on Friday.Also on Friday, the judge ruled that Mr Floyd's previous arrest, in which he was found with drugs, could be admitted to the jury as evidence.Prosecutors argue that the previous arrest will be unfairly used by the defence to try to dirty Mr Floyd's character. ",
    "The city of Minneapolis has reached a $27m (£19m) settlement with the family of George Floyd, the unarmed US black man whose death last May sparked protests worldwide.Mr Floyd's death after being trapped under the knee of police officer Derek Chauvin was captured on camera.Lawyers for the family said the footage created \"undeniable demand for justice and change\". Jury selection for Mr Chauvin's murder trial is currently under way. Six out of 12 jurors have been selected for hearings beginning on 29 March.The Minneapolis City Council voted unanimously to approve the pre-trial settlement, the largest ever awarded in the state of Minnesota.\"That the largest pre-trial settlement in a wrongful death case ever would be for the life of a black man sends a powerful message that black lives do matter and police brutality against people of colour must end,\" said Floyd family attorney Ben Crump.In a video of Mr Floyd's death that went viral on social media, four police officers confront the man for allegedly using a counterfeit $20 bill at a local shop.They drag him to the ground and Mr Chauvin places his knee on Mr Floyd's neck, even as he begs for his life and says \"I can't breathe\". He was later pronounced dead in hospital.Lawyers for the Floyd family filed a civil suit one month later, in June 2020.They argued the city had been negligent for failing to train officers in proper restraint techniques and for not dismissing officers with a poor track record. Dozens of complaints had previously been filed against Mr Chauvin, who had been serving on the city police force for 19 years. Speaking after the settlement was announced, Mr Crump said it was but \"one step\" on the journey to justice. Mr Floyd's death was a catalyst for reckoning on race and bias, he said. The civil settlement comes at the end of the first week in criminal court proceedings over Mr Chauvin's murder trial.The former officer is facing charges of second and third degree murder and second degree manslaughter. If found guilty on all counts, he could face a maximum sentence of 65 years in prison. He has pleaded not guilty.Six jurors have been selected for the trial so far.The final bench will require 12 jurors and four alternates - or substitutes - but suitable jurors have been hard to find in this emotionally charged and high-profile case.The three other officers involved in Mr Floyd's death - J Alexander Keung, Tou Thao and Thomas Lane - were charged with aiding and abetting murder and manslaughter, and will be tried separately later this year.",
    "A third-degree murder charge has been added against ex-Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin for the alleged killing of George Floyd.Mr Chauvin has already been charged with second-degree murder. Experts say the new charge is easier to prove in court, but carries a lesser penalty.Mr Chauvin has pleaded not guilty. His trial jury is currently being selected.He is accused of kneeling on Mr Floyd's neck for over eight minutes in an encounter that sparked global protests.The decision on whether the new murder charge would be added caused a delay in the trial earlier this week.Mr Chauvin is also accused of second-degree unintentional murder and manslaughter in the 25 May 2020 death of Mr Floyd. The maximum sentence he could face is 40 years.The less severe charge of third-degree murder was initially dismissed last year, but prosecutors requested to reinstate it.According to Minnesota state law, the maximum penalty for third-degree murder is 25 years.Hennepin County District Court Judge Peter Cahill's decision came after he initially ruled in October that third-degree murder was not appropriate.State prosecutors asked the Court of Appeals to intervene. Last week, they ordered the judge to reconsider the charge.The three judge panel ruled that Judge Cahill did not correctly apply precedent set in the trial of Mohamed Noor, the former Minneapolis officer who fatally shot an Australian woman who had called police in 2017. Mr Chauvin's defence lawyer's asked the state's Supreme Court to decide the issue, but on Wednesday the panel elected not to take up the case, effectively passing the decision back to Judge Cahill.To prove second-degree murder, prosecutors must convince jurors that a serious assault had been committed by Mr Chauvin, and that it was a \"substantial causal factor\" in Mr Floyd's death.Third-degree murder requires prosecutors to prove that Mr Chauvin showed a reckless disregard for human life, but not prove that an assault led to the death.So far six jurors have been selected for the closely-watched trial.Five are men and one is a woman.The 46-year-old was arrested on suspicion of using a counterfeit bill.He was handcuffed, but when officers tried to put him into the squad car he resisted and a struggle ended with Mr Floyd face down on the street.Mr Chauvin, 44, kneeled on Mr Floyd's back and neck for eight minutes and 46 seconds, according to prosecutors. Three other officers assisted Mr Chauvin in the arrest.Mr Floyd said he could not breathe more than 20 times. The video shows him go limp and get carried away by police.He was pronounced dead in hospital an hour later.",
    "Derek Chauvin, the former police officer filmed kneeling on George Floyd's neck before he died, is on trial in Minneapolis. Since Mr Floyd's arrest and death on 25 May, the 19-year police veteran has remained largely out of the spotlight and free on bail.Mr Chauvin will be the first of the four officers involved in the incident to stand trial. Jury selection began on 9 March.He is facing the most serious charges of the four, including second-degree murder. Mr Chauvin has pleaded not guilty to the charges.The others are charged with aiding and abetting Mr Chauvin's alleged crimes. He is charged with second-degree murder and manslaughter. Prosecutors are also seeking to add a charge of third-degree murder.Legal experts say that third-degree murder carries a lesser sentence, but it is easier to prove in court.To prove second-degree murder, prosecutors must convince jurors that a serious assault had been committed by Mr Chauvin, and that it was a \"substantial causal factor\" in Mr Floyd's death.Third-degree murder requires prosecutors to prove that Mr Chauvin showed a reckless disregard for human life, but not prove that an assault led to the death.In an unrelated case filed after Mr Floyd's death, prosecutors charged Mr Chauvin and his wife with underpaying taxes for six years. They have pleaded not guilty to nine charges against them. Each charge carries a sentence of five years in prison.Mr Chauvin, 44, was the most senior officer involved in Mr Floyd's arrest, having served for almost two decades with the Minneapolis Police Department.His record of policing included both commendations and complaints about conduct.In 2006, Mr Chauvin was recommended for a medal of valour for his role in the shooting of a man who aimed a shotgun at officers.There have been at least 15 conduct complaints against him, the Star Tribune reported, citing records from the Minneapolis Police Department's Internal Affairs. Most of the complaints were closed without discipline.Mr Chauvin's personal files were heavily redacted, but there are details of one complaint from 2007. It concerns allegations Mr Chauvin pulled a woman from her car and frisked her after she was caught driving 10mph (16 km/h) over the speed limit. A report found Mr Chauvin did not record audio of the incident and failed to switch his dashboard camera on during the stop.He was disciplined for this complaint and one other, receiving a letter of reprimand on both occasions, records show.Mr Chauvin served two stints in the US Army prior to his career with the police. He was a member of the military police from September 1996 to February 1997, and again from September 1999 to May 2000.His other previous jobs include security guard and McDonald's employee.The day after Mr Chauvin's arrest, a lawyer for his wife Kellie said she had filed for divorce.\"She is devastated by Mr Floyd's death and her utmost sympathy lies with his family, with his loved ones and with everyone who is grieving this tragedy,\" her lawyer said in a statement.After Mr Floyd's death, the owner of a nightclub in Minneapolis revealed that the two men had worked alongside each other every Tuesday night.Maya Santamaria, the owner of El Nuevo Rodeo said Mr Floyd worked security inside the club, while Mr Chauvin was paid while off duty to sit inside his squad car outside the club and occasionally help remove unruly patrons.\"I wouldn't characterise them as knowing each other,\" she told CNN, adding that \"they would have crossed paths\".Lawyers for Mr Floyd's family had argued that Mr Chauvin's alleged past relationship with Mr Floyd played a role in his death. An employee at the club initially claimed that the two men regularly \"butted heads\", but later said he had mistaken Mr Floyd for another black worker.On 7 October 2020, a judge agreed to free Mr Chauvin on a $1m (£718m) bail, pending trial. He had been held since May at a maximum-security prison in Oak Park Heights, Minnesota.Conditions of his bail include Mr Chauvin not contacting Mr Floyd's family, surrendering his firearms and not working in law enforcement or security as he awaits trial.In February, US media reported that former US Attorney General Bill Barr quashed a potential plea deal that would have seen Mr Chauvin spend 10 years behind bars in exchange for pleading guilty.The New York Times reported that Mr Barr, a Trump appointee, felt the deal was would be perceived as too lenient, and wanted state officials to be make their own decisions regarding Mr Chauvin's prosecution.The 46-year-old was arrested on suspicion of using a counterfeit $20 bill.He was handcuffed, but when officers tried to put him into the squad car he resisted and a struggle ended with Mr Floyd face down on the street.Mr Chauvin, 44, kneeled on Mr Floyd's back and neck for seven minutes and 46 seconds, according to prosecutors. Three other officers assisted Mr Chauvin.Mr Floyd said he could not breathe more than 20 times. The video shows him go limp and get carried away by police.He was pronounced dead in hospital an hour later.",

    "The first jurors have been picked in the trial of former police officer Derek Chauvin over the May 2020 killing of George Floyd, an unarmed black man.On Tuesday, two men and one woman were selected for the 12-member jury.Mr Chauvin, 44, is accused of second-degree unintentional murder and manslaughter in the death of Mr Floyd on 25 May last year. The less severe charge of third-degree murder was dismissed last year, but prosecutors have asked to reinstate it. The maximum sentence he faces is 40 years. Despite the dispute over the additional charge, Judge Peter Cahill moved forward with jury selection on Tuesday, after a one-day delay.The first juror selected, a chemist, who was white and in his 20s or 30s, described himself as \"logical\" and passionate about his work. He had not seen the video of Floyd's death, he said. The second juror, who appeared to be of mixed race and in her 20s, said she had seen the video only once and was eager to hear all the evidence as a juror. The third juror, an auditor, who was white, said that he would also examine guilt or innocence only from what is presented in the trial. All three swore to keep an open mind and weigh all the proof presented in determining the outcome of the high-profile case.The trial is scheduled to begin on 29 March. Jury selection continues on Wednesday. A total of 14 jurors are needed to make up the panel and alternates. George Floyd death: How will jurors be selected?",
    "A US judge has delayed jury selection in the case of an ex-Minneapolis police officer accused of killing George Floyd, an unarmed black man, last May.Derek Chauvin faces murder charges for kneeling on Mr Floyd's neck for over seven minutes in a widely-viewed video that sparked protests worldwide.The delay came as the judge awaits an appeals court decision on whether a new murder charge can be added.Jury selection is expected to resume on Tuesday morning.Mr Chauvin is accused of second-degree unintentional murder and manslaughter in the 25 May death of Mr Floyd. The maximum sentence he faces is 40 years.The less severe charge of third-degree murder was initially dismissed last year, but prosecutors have requested to reinstate it.Legal experts say that adding a third-degree charge could make it easier for prosecutors to get a conviction.Jury selection is expected to take about three weeks, with trial arguments due to begin on 29 March.More than 370 potential witnesses could be called to testify.The judge's decision followed prosecutors saying they would ask the appeals court to delay proceedings as the panel weighs whether the third-degree murder charge can be brought against Mr Chauvin.Hennepin County District Court Judge Peter Cahill said it was unlikely the appeals panel would respond before Tuesday.\"So unless any of the parties object I'm going to kick our jurors loose and start everything tomorrow with jury selection,\" the judge said.To prove second-degree murder, prosecutors must convince jurors that a serious assault had been committed by Mr Chauvin, and that it was a \"substantial causal factor\" in Mr Floyd's death.Third-degree murder requires prosecutors to prove that Mr Chauvin showed a reckless disregard for human life.Lawyers for Mr Chauvin said they would ask the Minnesota Supreme Court to review the court of appeals decision, which could lead to further delays.Mr Chauvin, who was fired from the Minneapolis police force and is currently free on a $1m (£725,000) bail, wore a blue suit and tie to court, as well as a black face mask. He took notes on a yellow legal pad during the hearing.The death of Mr Floyd sparked racial justice protests around the world. Most demonstrations were peaceful, though some turned violent.The trial, which is the fourth involving the killing of a civilian by a police officer in modern Minnesota history, has been highly anticipated.Barricades, fencing and barbed wire surround the courthouse in downtown Minneapolis as police brace for protests.On Monday, hundreds of demonstrators gathered in the city. Marches also occurred over the weekend.Three other ex-officers who were involved in Mr Floyd's arrest are due to stand trial together later this year.Analysis by Tara McKelvey, BBC News, MinneapolisBarbed wire surrounds the courthouse, and Forest McClarron, 34, an army veteran, walks past, looking up at the building.  He lives on Chicago Avenue, where George Floyd was pinned to the ground. \"I hope they find unbiased people,\" McClarron says, referring to the jury selection process. \"Just honest, unbiased people.\" Near him a woman walks with her husband to a vehicle parked on South Third Avenue. He has an assault rifle, and a paper cup sits on the bonnet of the vehicle. He works in private security, and they are here to keep activists safe \"from white supremacists,\" they say.  The mood is calm and the street smells like cannabis while people wait to see what happens with the jury, and with those who have gathered outside the courthouse. A jury of 12 and four alternates will be selected by lawyers for each side from a pool of eligible local citizens.Each potential juror has filled in a 16-page questionnaire, which asks about news viewing habits, how many times they watched the video of Mr Floyd's arrest, belief in the US criminal justice system, and other questions related to the case.In cases involving issues such as racism, the selection process can be seen as hugely important to the outcome of the trial and how fair it is perceived.The 46-year-old was arrested outside a convenience store on suspicion of using a counterfeit $20 bill.Officers arrived and handcuffed him, but when they tried to put him into the squad car he resisted and a struggle ended with Mr Floyd face down on the street.Mr Chauvin, 44, placed his left knee between Mr Floyd's head and neck, and kept it there for seven minutes and 46 seconds, according to prosecutors. Two other officers helped pin him down, while another prevented witnesses from intervening.Mr Floyd said he could not breathe more than 20 times. The video shows him go limp and get carried away by police.He was pronounced dead in hospital an hour later.",
    "Two legal teams fought tooth and nail over three gruelling weeks. This week, they rounded out the jury panel for arguably the highest profile murder trial in Minnesota history.Former police officer Derek Chauvin goes on trial next Monday on two counts of murder and one count of manslaughter over the death of George Floyd, an unarmed black man, last May in the city of Minneapolis.Fourteen jurors, who will remain anonymous and unseen throughout the televised trial, will decide whether Mr Chauvin should serve time in prison or be acquitted.Whatever the final verdict in this highly publicised case, it will likely have implications for the Black Lives Matter movement and the future of policing in the US.Selecting jurors in an emotionally charged case over a black man's death at the hands of a white police officer was no easy feat, but it was made even more complicated in the George Floyd case because of how well known his death was.After 11 days worth of summons, the two opposing legal teams settled on 15 Minnesota residents out of a jury pool of over 130 people.Among that group, 14 - including two alternates - will be sworn in next Monday, while the 15th juror is a backup option, in case a juror drops out before the trial begins.The jury panel skews younger, more white and more female. It includes a black grandmother in her 60s, the oldest member of the jury, who said she stopped watching the infamous video of Mr Floyd's death because \"it just wasn't something I needed to see\". She also claimed she used to live 10 blocks from where he had died.Others too admitted that they found the video difficult to watch, with one newly-wed white woman, a social worker in her 20s, saying \"I had every emotion\".The Floyd video may become the centrepiece of this trial, but prospective jurors were also questioned about their opinions on the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement, the opposing Blue Lives Matter movement (which advocates for police officers), the push among activists to \"defund the police\" and the violence associated with some BLM protests.A white woman in her 50s claimed she used to work at a suburban business damaged last summer after Mr Floyd's death. She had seen the video, but said she generally trusted the police and felt that those who followed instructions had nothing to fear.A black man in his 40s said that, while he believed minorities are mistreated regularly by the police, he strongly disagreed with defunding - or redirecting funds away from - police departments.In Hennepin County, where the trial is being held, white people make up nearly three-quarters of the population, according to US census data.It is also home to a large immigrant population, slightly higher than the national average. So the makeup of the jury is \"a mixed bag\", argues Jason Nichols, a progressive political and social analyst who teaches African American Studies at the University of Maryland.He says jurors will find the visuals of Mr Floyd's death deeply affecting: \"Once you turn that video on, it's hard to watch. We saw, in its aftermath, that was the highest Black Lives Matter had ever polled.\"\"But imagine you're somebody who looks at that situation and thinks 'that could be me,'\" he added, in a nod to the six people of colour on the jury.Mr Nichols cautions, however, that we cannot pre-judge how a juror will operate.Some of the white jurors may be progressives who view the Floyd video as \"an egregious case of racism\", he said, whereas the other ones may not \"see their husbands or fathers\" in Mr Floyd if the defence portrays him as a 6-foot-4 black man under the influence of drugs and behaving erratically.At least one black juror is an immigrant, not an African American, and Mr Nichols says \"they may not see themselves in George Floyd because their connection to police brutality is different\".Regardless of background, he said: \"It's going to be really interesting to see where the American people are, how unified we are and how willing to accept evidence, whether it's positive or negative.\"All potential jurors completed a 16-page questionnaire before arriving in the courtroom. Questions asked them to weigh in on policing in the US, racial discrimination, Black Lives Matter, Blue Lives Matter, their own interactions with police and their level of familiarity with the Floyd case.Inside the heavily-guarded courtroom, Judge Peter Cahill swore in each person before they were questioned one-by-one, a process known as voir dire.Mr Chauvin's lead attorney, Eric Nelson, posed questions on behalf of the defence, while Steve Schleicher questioned members of the jury pool for the prosecution.Each juror was only identified by a number. No names, addresses or other identifying details will be revealed at any time and they will not be shown on screen.A sensitive process was made even more complicated last week, when the city of Minneapolis settled a wrongful death civil suit with the family of Mr Floyd for a record $27m (£19.7m), the largest in the state's history.It forced Judge Cahill to dismiss two jurors who had been previously selected, as well as excuse at least three prospects, after they admitted the payout had influenced their opinions on the case.Members of the jury pool who were excused often expressed strongly negative views on Mr Floyd, Mr Chauvin or other related topics.One woman, a nursing assistant, told the court she joined a protest after Mr Floyd's death because she believed: \"It was not his time to die, and the incident should not have gone as far as it did.\"Another woman, a mother of five, denounced the violence in the wake of Mr Floyd's killing, saying: \"There is more crime than there was before. The reputation of the city seems to have taken a hit.\"It is all a sign of just how high the stakes in this trial are.Mary Frances Berry, a former chairwoman of the US Commission on Civil Rights, says the trial will be \"a test of whether the Black Lives Matter protests still have potency\".Ms Berry says \"even under the best circumstances, police officers are not convicted of murder and can argue that what they did was reasonable\".\"We're at a moment when whether or not we are going to do something about reforming police is very much contested,\" says Ms Berry, who noted the jury's verdict must be unanimous.If Mr Chauvin is convicted, she says it will be \"a departure\" from past practice and will \"send a signal to police that these kind of behaviours are not valid\".But if he is not, \"it signals that, no matter how bad the behaviour and no matter what you see with your own eyes, police are so supported and they can get away with killing unarmed people under these circumstances\", she said.Mr Nichols agrees, calling it \"a pivotal moment in our culture\". He says African Americans have seen several miscarriages of justice, especially in recent years, and does not view the justice system as valuing their lives.A conviction for Mr Chauvin will bring only \"a brief sigh of relief\", he believes, \"because we're only waiting unfortunately - until we have real systemic change - for the next George Floyd situation\".\"Justice looks at the facts and justice makes a fair determination. And, thus far, we have not seen that,\" he said.\"People are going to pay attention to this trial.\"",
    "Jury selection is about to start in the trial of Derek Chauvin, the police officer accused of killing George Floyd. Onlookers in the US city of Minneapolis recorded Chauvin - who's white - kneeling on the neck of Floyd, who was black. The incident sparked protests in the US and across the world against police brutality and racism. The 46-year-old bought a pack of cigarettes at a convenience store in South Minneapolis on the evening of 25 May 2020.A shop assistant believed he used a counterfeit $20 bill and called the police after Mr Floyd refused to give the cigarettes back.Officers arrived and handcuffed him, but when they tried to put him into the squad car he resisted, and a struggle ended with Mr Floyd face-down on the street.That's when onlookers began filming.Mr Chauvin, 44, placed his left knee between Mr Floyd's head and neck, and kept it there for seven minutes and 46 seconds, according to prosecutors. Two other officers helped pin him down, while another prevented witnesses from intervening.More than 20 times Mr Floyd said he could not breathe. The video shows him go limp and get carried away by police.He was pronounced dead in hospital an hour later.The weeks-long process will begin on Monday 8 March with jury selection. Arguments are due to start on 29 March and are expected to take at least one month.The contentious process will see lawyers for both sides question dozens - or possibly hundreds of candidates - and eventually choose 16 people.Twelve jurors will be seated to decide the case, with four other alternates chosen as backups.Potential jurors have already submitted questionnaires, describing their existing knowledge of the case, any previous contact with police and their media habits.Each side can remove a potential juror from the panel, but if either side believes a juror has been relieved due to discrimination based on race, ethnicity or sex, opposing lawyers can issue a \"Batson challenge\". The judge then decides whether the juror stays or goes.The four police officers at the scene were fired the following day as crowds took to the streets of Minneapolis to protest. The station where they worked was set ablaze and protests quickly spread to other cities.By the sixth night, there were protests in 75 cities across the US - some violent - and a national debate about police brutality against African-Americans was reignited.An anti-racism movement created in 2013 after the killing of teenager Trayvon Martin, Black Lives Matter, was re-energised by the protests.Even very white, small towns in rural parts of the US held protests to remember Mr Floyd and take a stand against racial injustice.Reforms were introduced by lawmakers to change the way some police forces make arrests and detain suspects.But the conversation soon widened from policing to issues such as workplace equality, unconscious bias and the legacy of slavery.Anti-racism protests were held in countries across the world in response to the death.Many focused on their own victims of alleged police violence.In Australia, the focus was on the indigenous community, while in the UK, a statue of a 17th Century slave trader was torn down and thrown into Bristol harbour.Many corporate brands also expressed support for Black Lives Matter, while many athletes now \"take the knee\" in solidarity before events.Mr Chauvin is charged with second-degree murder, which means causing death without intent. The maximum sentence is 40 years. It is rare that police officers in the US are charged, let alone convicted, for use of lethal force. This is partly because they can often successfully argue that they feared for their lives.Mr Chauvin is standing trial separately from the other three police officers, due to Covid restrictions on space.The others are charged with aiding and abetting second-degree murder and will come before the courts in August.The entire trial will be streamed online - unusually for a US murder case.The judge has ruled that only one member of the Chauvin and Floyd families can be in court at any one time.Face masks with slogans are banned in the courtroom.",
    "",
    "It was video footage seen across the world - Derek Chauvin with his knee pressed on the neck of George Floyd for about nine minutes before he died. Now the former US police officer faces trial on second-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter charges.Three other dismissed officers will stand trial together later this year, but proceedings in Mr Chauvin's trial will start on Monday, when jury selection begins.A pool of eligible local citizens has been called to appear by Hennepin County in Minnesota. From them, a jury of 12 and four alternates will be selected. It could take weeks.Although it is highly unlikely potential jurors will have no prior knowledge of the case - George Floyd's death in May last year in Minneapolis inspired weeks of global protests - they will be questioned to determine whether they will be able to judge Derek Chauvin fairly.The prosecution and defence can both ask Judge Peter Cahill to dismiss a potential juror \"for cause\" if they perceive bias. The prosecution can also dismiss nine potential jurors - and the defence team 15 - without giving any reason, although this can be objected to.Once 16 people have been approved, the jury can be seated. The trial itself will not begin until 29 March. Each potential juror has already been asked to fill in a 16-page questionnaire about the case.The main thrust is to determine familiarity with the case and issues such as a potential juror's own interactions with law enforcement.Key questions include:How potential jurors respond can lead to either defence or prosecution dismissing them.Prof Valerie Hans, a jury researcher based at Cornell Law School, says the questionnaire is more detailed and personal than most pre-trial documents, and asks about their \"deepest attitudes on some of the most important political and social topics of the day\".Prof Hans says the aim for the two teams is to get \"a sense of whether or not a prospective juror will be open to the kinds of arguments that they intend to make over the course of the trial\".The selection process is different from the UK. Jury trials there are less common, and jurors - picked at random - don't know which trial they will serve on until they've been sworn in. Jurors can only be dismissed by a judge in very specific circumstances.In cases involving issues such as racism, the selection process can be seen as hugely important to the outcome of the trial and how fair it is perceived. A lack of diversity could lead to questions about the legitimacy of the verdict.The jury pool in Hennepin County was 80% white and 8% black in the financial year to September 2020, the New York Times reported, a bigger gap than for Minneapolis as a whole (64% to 19%).The vetting system does try to ensure that a cross-section of society is represented, but at the same time, both defence and prosecution will be looking for jurors that will bring them a favourable outcome.In high-stakes trials, they often use special consultants who look at factors such as the jurors' backgrounds and even their body language.Prof Hans says the judge will need to keep a close eye on patterns emerging among dismissals of potential jurors by the prosecution or defence, as this cannot be done on race grounds.In general terms, legal experts say white jurors are less likely to convict law enforcement officials, although it is in unclear how much of this has changed following the worldwide reaction to the Floyd case.The chosen jurors will be partially sequestered, or isolated, during the trial and fully sequestered once deliberation starts. They will also remain anonymous until the judge allows their identities to be made public. It's not uncommon for US jurors to speak out about their deliberations afterwards, and in some infamous examples, like the OJ Simpson trial, some have even gone on to write books about their experiences.The high-profile video of George Floyd's death brought an outpouring of anger in the US and beyond, but securing a legal conviction is another matter.The first issue is the charges. To convict of second-degree murder, jurors must find that Mr Chauvin had committed, or was trying to commit, a felony that caused the death.Second-degree manslaughter would mean Mr Chauvin had consciously taken the chance of causing death or injury through his negligent actions.The defence will point to Floyd's health issues or drug consumption as a likely cause of death - although the judge has already written that the prosecution only has to prove Mr Chauvin's actions were a \"substantial causal factor\".The defence will also argue Mr Chauvin was authorised to use force in his role as a police officer, in an attempt to undermine the accusation that he was trying to commit a felony.The prosecution will rely on the strong video evidence, pointing to the length of time Floyd's neck was pressed as passers-by pleaded for him, and alleging that the officer broke police department policy.It will also submit evidence of Mr Chauvin's actions in separate cases. This will include an instance where the officer restrained a female by placing his knee on her neck.",
    "A plan to pay social media influencers to post \"city-approved\" messages ahead of the trial of a former police officer over his role in the death of George Floyd has been scrapped.Officials in Minneapolis had planned to pay six influencers $2,000 each. It was part of a wider effort to reach \"communities that do not typically follow mainstream news sources or City communication channels\".But some said it had reflected a \"lack of trust\".The city has apologised and said the plan would be abandoned.Following the backlash, officials were sent an email saying the plan had been scrapped. The message, viewed and published by ABC News, said: \"While we believe in and support the intention of this recommendation, we have seen the impact has caused harm. We are sorry and acknowledge that we will have to work to repair the harm that has been caused.\"The death of George Floyd sparked global protests and calls for police reform, spurred by the Black Lives Matter movement. The trial of Derek Chauvin, who is charged with the second-degree murder of George Floyd, is due to start on 8 March.The influencer plan was part of a wider $1m communication budget for the trial.But some questioned the need for it and asked what the phrase \"city-approved\" would actually mean.\"It really reflects that they know there's a lack of trust between community and city institutions and that's real,\" Sarah Davis, executive director of the Legal Rights Center in Minneapolis told CBS.And activist and social media influencer Toussaint Morrison told the publication: \"The key word here is 'city-approved'. What do you think the message is going to be? It's going to be pro-city, it's going to be anti-protest.\"The city has this week been preparing for protests, putting up barbed wire fences around the courthouse, city hall and county jail. ",

    "A policeman shared a grossly offensive meme of George Floyd's arrest to fellow officers, a court was told.Sgt Geraint Jones was off duty when he forwarded the altered image of the arrest just a few days after Mr Floyd died, Plymouth magistrates heard.Mr Floyd, 46, died in the US after a white police officer knelt on his neck for almost nine minutes on 25 May 2019.Sgt Jones denies sending a grossly offensive image in a WhatsApp group of six officers and two others.One of the group members complained to a senior officer and Devon and Cornwall Police's professional standards department about the image Sgt Jones had forwarded.Prosecuting barrister Lee Bremridge said Sgt Jones had been a police officer for 23 years and was based in the custody centre at Torquay.Mr Bremridge said Sgt Jones told investigators from police watchdog the Independent Office for Police Conduct: \"I deeply regret my actions. It was stupid of me and ill thought out.\"The court heard he described sending the meme on 30 May 2019 as a \"clumsy attempt at humour\".Sgt Jones told investigators that he was \"not making light of George Floyd's killing\".\"The death of Mr Floyd is not amusing, to anyone in their right mind it is not amusing,\" he said.Sgt Jones said he could \"understand that people do think it's offensive,\" but denied it was grossly offensive.He said there were no BAME members of the group and had there been he may have been a \"bit more sensitive and emotionally aware\".The court heard that some of the people on the WhatsApp responded to the meme with laughing emojis.Defence barrister James Hodivala QC said Sgt Jones intended it \"as a joke\" and was not intending to cause gross offence.Mr Hodivala said a conviction would have a \"chilling effect on humour\" and said: \"These are modern issues, society tolerates different senses of humour.\"District Judge Jo Matson said she would make her judgement and adjourned the case until 21 April.Follow BBC News South West on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.

    "A suburb of Chicago is to become the first city in the United States to pay reparations to black residents who have suffered housing discrimination.The city council in Evanston, Illinois, voted 8-1 to distribute $25,000 (£18,000) each to 16 eligible black households to use for home repairs or as down payments on property.The funds come mostly from a new tax on legalised marijuana.Black Americans were disadvantaged by racist housing decisions.To be eligible, residents must be a black person who lived in Evanston between 1919 to 1969, or a descendant of such a person. The family must also have been a victim of discrimination in housing because of policies or practices in the city in that time. Evanston has pledged distribute $10 million over a decade. Around 16% of the city's residents are black.White residents in Evanston out-earn black residents by $46,000 a year.\"We're very excited to see the first national direct benefit from some of the harms we've had to experience from the past,\" Kamm Howard, co-chair of the National Coalition of Blacks for Reparations in America, told CBS News.\"The more local initiatives occur, the more impetus there is on the federal government to act.\"But not everyone has been supportive of reparations in this form.Alderman Cicely Fleming, who is herself black and voted against the plan, said she supported reparations, but said the plan assumed black people could not manage their own money. \"True reparations should respect black people's autonomy and allow them to determine how repair will be managed,\" she said.Discussions over how to address housing discrimination increased following a report last year that illustrated how black people had faced restrictions on where they could live dating back to 1855, when the first black resident arrived.The impact over generations \"was cumulative and permanent. They were the means by which legacies were limited and denied\", the report stated.A fair housing law was passed in Evanston in 1968, but evidence showed that black people were steered towards a section of town where they were the majority until 1985. Hundreds of communities across the US are considering reparations to black people, including the state of California, Iowa City and Providence, Rhode Island. But there is not a lot of support for such reparations in the US.A Reuters/Ipsos survey last year found that just 20% of respondents backed using \"taxpayer money to pay damages to descendants of enslaved people in the United States\". The movement towards some form of reparation for African Americans as a restitution for centuries of slavery and racism accelerated in the wake of the death of George Floyd last year. The unarmed black man died in Minneapolis while detained by police and this sparked worldwide protests. ",
    "Successive governments have failed to tackle racial discrimination in Wales, according to a leading expert.  Prof Emmanuel Ogbonna said laws designed to protect people simply have not been implemented and he was now involved in developing a Race Equality Action Plan for the Welsh government. It comes as one charity has seen an increase in people seeking support for race discrimination and hate crimes.  Deputy minister Jane Hutt acknowledged action to date had not been enough. Race Equality First said it was compiling a report to the UN, examining Wales' progress in eliminating racial discrimination. Roon Adam, from the charity, said the death of George Floyd in America last year changed things, prompting others to raise problems and have their voices heard. \"These communities have been in Wales for 50, 60, or 100 years,\" she said.  \"The problems they are facing now more or less existed then. It's a different generation now but it's the same problem and it's not being solved.\" Prof Ogbonna, who is an academic at Cardiff University, in a recent report for the Welsh government looking at Covid's impact on black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) communities, found systemic institutional racism may have played a role. \"The challenge ahead is huge,\" he said. \"Successive governments have not taken any action on race.\" But he argued any future action plan needed to be underpinned in law - although he acknowledged existing laws had failed to make the change required. \"People continue to suffer racial and ethnic discrimination - the reason being that organisations and institutions have simply failed to implement the laws - and nobody's asked questions. Nobody's asked why,\" he said.\"As part of this action plan, we plan to hold institutions and the Welsh government to account.\" Ms Adam said: \"Wales still has a long way to go.\" She explained Race Equality First has worked in this field in Wales for 45 years. From racist bullying being \"an everyday reality for BAME children\", to healthcare, housing, employment and racial profiling, \"you name it, we deal with it all\". She said the issues affect all areas of people's lives, leaving many feeling isolated, humiliated or even suicidal. \"Last year we had nearly 200 cases, but the number of enquiries is far greater,\" she said.\"In many cases people don't take it forward - they don't have trust in the justice system, they feel there's no point.\"She said over the last year they'd seen a big increase in the number of calls for support, as well as anti-discrimination and racism training for organisations. \"A lot of people and organizations understood that it is not enough to simply 'not be racist' but that you have to be 'actively anti racist',\" she added.One person who agrees that more need to be done said she often receives racist abuse.Zoe - not her real name - has had problems with her neighbour for more than three years, involving attacks on her property and racist slurs.It has now reached the point where Zoe can only make certain phone calls from her stairs, as she is aware the neighbour listens in.She said that she does not feel safe living in her home because of this.She said: \"I feel scared that she's unpredictable, but the people she invites to the house could also cause me harm as well, because of the drinking involved.\"It's caused lots of sleepless nights. It's caused fear in case she comes into my garden - she previously tried to break down my door.\"Her neighbour was given a suspended sentence, curfew and restraining order, but attempts to have her evicted have so far failed.\"It feels like her needs are being put before mine,\" said Zoe.Jane Hutt, deputy minister and chief whip, said: \"We've recognised that there is structural inequality in the way we plan and deliver our policies and services - institutional racism results from that.\"It's crucial we get this [action plan] right and that we're held to account.\"It's about a fundamental change of behaviour and the way we plan and prioritise our services, and that includes budgets. It means everything should go through the lens of 'what is this going to do to tackle racial disparities?'\"  She added that as well as putting a responsibility on all levels of government, private, public and third sector, political parties must also change and show better diversity. \"This is not going to happen overnight, but I think there is a commitment there that this is one of the most important things for Wales going forward,\" she said.\"We want to be an anti-racist Wales.\" Jane Dodds, leader of the Welsh Liberal Democrats, said: \"There is no place in Wales for discrimination of any type and whilst progress has been made, more needs to be done.\"Everyone in society needs to work together to address and eliminate the discrimination which exists in Wales. Everyone from the government down has a role to play in this.\"Plaid Cymru's shadow minister for equalities, Leanne Wood, said: \"Systematic and systemic racism in Wales has long been rife, and it has been made clearer than ever during Covid through its disproportionate effects on BAME communities.\"The report from Welsh government's advisory group emphasising such issues should have been a final wake up call for the Welsh government to take urgent and immediate action to tackle the long standing inequalities that exist in Wales. \"Plaid called last summer for a full and thorough investigation into systemic racism in Wales with concrete recommendations to be honoured, and lead various debates in the Senedd calling for the mandatory inclusion of the history of black people and people of colour in the new curriculum to inform pupils and set a precedent for a modern, forward thinking country free of prejudice.\"Plaid Cymru is also advocating for Wales to have its own justice system in order to tackle the inequalities that exist within it, including the disproportionate imprisonment rates among BAME communities.\" A Welsh Conservative spokesperson said: \"We're not surprised to find that the Welsh government's duties and responsibilities with reference to anti-discrimination policies haven't been properly implemented; they join a long litany of other areas where this Labour government has let down the very people it serves.\"However, we are pleased to learn that Professor Emmanuel Ogbonna is working on the Race Equality Action Plan, and look forward to future discussions with him about how to tackle the sadly still-existing problem of racism and racial discrimination in Wales, which are completely unacceptable to - thankfully - the vast majority of people living in a modern, dynamic, and diverse United Kingdom.\"",
    "Minneapolis police have released bodycam footage of a fatal shooting by officers, the first death at the hands of police in the US city since that of George Floyd, a black man, in May.The victim, Dolal Idd, 23, was a suspect in a felony and was stopped by police on Wednesday. He was also black.Initial witness statements and police say Mr Idd fired first and was shot dead when the officers returned fire.Minneapolis saw months of unrest after Mr Floyd's death in police custody.The protests spread across the US amid allegations of police brutality. Mr Floyd died after a police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes.The footage from Wednesday's fatal shooting, from the bodycam of one of the officers involved, was released late on Thursday.It shows the officers' cars blocking a white vehicle at a petrol station on the city's south side, not far from where Mr Floyd died.The police are heard shouting \"Stop your car, hands up, hands up!\" before shots are fired, including by the officers.A female passenger in the car with Mr Idd was not hurt, police said, nor were the officers.Minneapolis police chief Medaria Arradondo said a gun was found at the scene.\"When I viewed the video that everyone else is viewing - and certainly the real-time slow-down version - it appears the individual inside the vehicle fired his weapon at the officers first,\" he said.People including Mr Idd's father Bayle Gelle gathered at the scene the following day, prompting fears of renewed protests.\"He was just sitting in the car, and bullets were shot at him, and no reason,\" he said, quoted by CBS News. \"Why are we here?... Because of colour. He is a black man. We want to know why my sweet son gets shot and killed.\"City mayor Jacob Frey said he was committed to getting the facts and pursuing justice.\"We know a life has been cut short tonight and that trust between communities of colour and law enforcement is fragile,\" he said in a statement.\"Rebuilding that trust will depend on complete transparency.\"Mr Floyd's death in May led to calls for reform or even abolition of the city's police department, but those efforts have stalled.",

    "The recorded music industry made $21.6bn (£15.7bn) last year, the highest figure since 2002.Revenues grew by 7.4%, driven by the success of artists like Billie Eilish, Taylor Swift and Drake in the charts.BTS had the best-selling album, Map Of The Soul: 7; while The Weeknd's retro-pop anthem Blinding Lights was the biggest single, shifting 2.7bn copies.Streaming sites like Spotify and Apple Music accounted for 62.1% of all revenues, reaching $13.4bn (£9.7bn).More than 443 million people now pay for a music streaming subscription, said the IFPI, which represents the global music industry.That means 102 million people signed up for a new account last year, compared to 85 million in 2019, and 79 million in 2018. However, while the number of subscribers jumped by 29%, revenues from streaming only grew by 19.5% - as price plans tend to be lower in new markets like India and Russia.The figures, revealed in the IFPI's annual Global Music Report, are a reminder of \"the enduring power of music to console, heal and lift our spirits,\" during the pandemic, said chief executive Frances Moore.\"Some things are timeless, like the power of a great song or the connection between artists and fans. But some things have changed. With so much of the world in lockdown and live music shut down, in nearly every corner of the globe most fans enjoyed music via streaming.\"The IFPI's figures do not include live music revenue, which is the sector of the industry most affected by the pandemic.However, performance revenues - the royalties earned when music is played on radio, TV or in concert - were counted, and declined by 10.1% to $2.3bn (£1.7bn).It is hoped that live music will resume this summer, depending on the roll-out of the Covid-19 vaccine; but the IFPI's annual report highlighted how livestreams and virtual concerts had helped musicians reach fans over the last 12 months.US rapper Travis Scott performed a show inside the video game Fortnite during the first lockdown in April, attracting 12.3 million fans, and boosting his streaming numbers by 136%.\"We definitely exposed him to new audiences, and these are fans that will now stick with him forever,\" said Sylvia Rhone, who runs Epic Records. \"This was truly global and fuelled a massive global following for him.\"British pop star Dua Lipa enjoyed a similar boost from her ambitious Studio 2054 livestream in November, which pulled in five million views, including more than 1.9 million unique log-ins from China.In addition to the show's Hollywood-scale production values, fans were sent glitter balls and strobe lights in advance to make it feel like a \"proper event\", said Jessica Keeley-Carter, vice president of marketing at Warner Music.\"Everyone's aware of the amount of lo-fi live streams that started popping up when everyone was locked in. They became boring really quickly, so what was great was the team thought, 'How can we shake this up?'\"That became our world tour,\" added Joe Kentish, Warner's head of A&R, \"and we did massive amounts of promotion in every significant territory based around that event - it was different, but it was also sort of the same.\" He added: \"I watched it again the other day and I'd almost forgotten the whole point of this record - it is basically a party. And I have to admit, I thought, 'This would have been so good at Glastonbury'.\"BTS were the world's biggest act, marking the first time a South Korean band has topped the global chart. The pop group pushed Taylor Swift, who took the crown last year, into second place, while Drake came third - despite not releasing a new album in 2020.BTS had two of the year's top 10 best-selling records, led by Map Of The Soul: 7, which fans bought or downloaded 4.8 million times. Their fifth album, Be, which was recorded in response to the coronavirus pandemic, was the fourth biggest-seller, on 2.69 million copies; while the Japanese-language Map Of The Soul: 7 - The Journey, sold 1.17 million.The UK retained its place as the world's third-biggest music market, with revenues of $1.5bn (£1.1bn).Lewis Capaldi's Divinely Uninspired To A Hellish Extent was the UK's biggest-selling album for the second year in a row; while Harry Styles' Fine Line was the best-selling British album globally.They helped the UK's music industry achieve a fifth consecutive year of growth, although the rate of growth slowed down (from 7.3% in 2019 to 3.8% in 2020), due to the pandemic.Income from performance rights was predictably the worst affected, dropping by more than a fifth to $145m (£105m).\"The lockdowns inevitably affected financial results in 2020,\" said Geoff Taylor of the BPI, which represents record labels in the UK.\"But, unlike other parts of our industry which were hit very hard, the seamless connectivity of streaming and the enduring love of vinyl meant that recorded music was relatively insulated from its worst effects, and was still able to post growth.\"The IFPI's annual report also looked at the record industry's efforts to improve diversity and representation in the wake of the Black Lives Matter protests last summer.Record labels reacted by dropping outdated words like \"urban\" from their repertoire, while some bands - including Dixie Chicks and Lady Antebellum - changed their names because of associations to slavery. Internally, many companies launched taskforces to help identify and develop female, black and underrepresented executives within their ranks.\"The challenge is to keep the work going long after it is politically expedient, sexy and at the forefront of people's minds,\" said Warner Music's head of diversity and inclusion, Dr Maurice Stinnett.\"When it's no longer a hot button, that's when we continue to do the work that desperately needs to be done.\"Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

    "In March 1991, black motorist Rodney King was beaten by white police officers in Los Angeles - and it was caught on camera. The trial and subsequent acquittal of the officers involved sparked violent riots in a community that felt there had been no sense of accountability. The outcry eventually forced changes to the Los Angeles Police Department.Three decades later in Minneapolis, the death of George Floyd at the hands of police is also filmed by bystanders. Protests erupt in cities across the US, and later, around the globe.Now, as a city awaits the trial and its aftermath, here's a look back at another influential American courtroom, some 30 years ago, thanks to newly released sketches from the King trial.The black-and-white witness footage of four white officers beating and kicking King nearly to death was one of the first instances such brutality had been filmed.The community had been grappling with excessive use of force by the majority white police department for years before the King incident -  but now, there was proof.A year later, in 1992, acquittal of the officers involved that sparked massive unrest in Los Angeles. Tensions over longstanding race and economic inequalities boiled over. Shopping centres were looted and burned. Fifty-four people died. Thousands were arrested.Following that grainy video of King's beating were many more incidents of police brutality against black Americans. Dozens have made national headlines, led to protests, movements, calls for real change.These courtroom sketches, recently acquired by the US Library of Congress, capture the tense and febrile atmosphere of the trial.The footage and outcry over George Floyd's death has perhaps been the most influential in recent years.The George Floyd trial begins on 8 March, with jury selection. Twelve jurors will be seated to decide the case.Arguments are due to start on 29 March and are expected to take at least one month. .",
    "A self-proclaimed member of a violent anti-government group has been charged with rioting during the George Floyd protests in Minnesota.Federal prosecutors said Ivan Hunter, a 26-year-old from Texas, opened fire on a Minneapolis police precinct to escalate the unrest back in May.He was arrested in an FBI investigation into the Boogaloo Bois extremists.Other far-right groups have also been suspected of trying to foment violence at recent racial justice protests.The protests began after the death of George Floyd, a black man, in police custody. At times, the demonstrations turned violent.The US Attorney's Office in Minnesota has charged Mr Hunter with one count of travelling across state lines with the intent to participate in a riot. Prosecutors allege Mr Hunter had travelled from Boerne, Texas, in an effort to incite unrest with other members of the Boogaloo Bois group.Mr Hunter is accused of firing 13 rounds from an AK-47 style semiautomatic rifle into the police department on 28 May. He was filmed high-fiving others and shouting \"Justice for Floyd\", according to the criminal complaint announced on Friday. Officials also said another person involved in the incident told authorities Mr Hunter was the one who fired the shots.The police building was eventually set on fire by protesters.Prosecutors say when he returned to Texas, Mr Hunter referenced participating in violence in Minneapolis on social media, allegedly messaging someone saying that he \"set fire to that precinct with the black community\".He was stopped by police in Austin, Texas, on 3 June, as the vehicle he was in had traffic violations. He was one of three individuals in the vehicle, and he had loaded magazines for an assault rifle on his person, officers said.There were three semi-automatic rifles in the vehicle and two loaded pistols. Following the traffic stop, federal agents learned of his connections to the Boogaloo Bois, a loosely organised extremist group that wants to overthrow the government. Mr Hunter had an online affiliation with Steven Carrillo, another Boogaloo Bois member accused of murdering a federal officer in California.A statement from the Minnesota US Attorney's office said Mr Hunter was arrested on 21 October in San Antonio, Texas, and appeared in court on 22 October.Some are capitalising on the protests to engage in acts of violence against authorities. Three Boogaloo members were charged with terrorism offences in Nevada in June for alleged attempts to \"spark violence\" in protests.",
    "All children will be taught about racism and the contributions of Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic communities, the education minister said.Almost 35,000 people have called for Britain's colonial past to be taught in school lessons. Under changes to the new curriculum the teaching of BAME histories will be mandatory, Kirsty Williams said.Ms Williams said it would help pupils become \"informed citizens of the world\".However, Plaid Cymru argued the changes were not included in the school curriculum law, passed in the Senedd last week, but instead in a code which could be changed or got rid of by ministers. The Welsh government said this was \"incorrect\" and the teaching of BAME stories would be required in every school.Wales' new curriculum, set to be introduced in 2022, is based on six \"areas of learning and experience\" and does not set out exactly what schools should be teaching.However, the changes will now mean all learning areas will need to reflect the diverse experiences and contributions of BAME communities and individuals to both past and present Wales.Following worldwide protests after the death of George Floyd in US police custody, there were calls for greater recognition of Wales' role in colonialism and slavery to be taught in schools.Prof Charlotte Williams, who led a working group set up by the Welsh government to look at how BAME contributions through history was taught in schools, said there was considerable evidence of \"racial inequality\" in Wales' education system.She said the new curriculum was an opportunity for \"significant change\", and it was the right of \"every child to learn about histories and contributions that have shaped the Welsh nation\".In a report published on Friday, Prof Williams said with schools able to set their own curriculum under the national framework BAME histories could \"continue to be marginalised or ignored\", unless made mandatory.While learning about diversity, identity and equality is mandatory under the new curriculum, there is no requirement for schools to teach pupils about slavery, the British Empire, or the Holocaust, Ms Williams writes.Prof Williams said this was concerning as these areas were \"topics of central understanding to the histories of racism and diversity\".In 2019, 12% of all pupils aged five and over came from minority ethnic backgrounds, but this differs widely across Wales, from 34.4% in Cardiff to 4.1% in Anglesey, according to Pupil Level Annual School Census data.Fewer than 1% of teachers in Wales say they are black, Asian, or from other or mixed minority ethnic backgrounds, according to the 2019-20 school workforce census.Forty of the 1,065 students who began training to become teachers in Wales in 2018-19 said they were from a minority ethnic group.Prof Williams, who has previously spoken about growing up in Llandudno where her family were the only black family, said children were being \"failed\" by a lack of positive role models in schools and a curriculum that did not represent their histories.She said all children should be able to learn about diverse history and talent regardless of their background or where they lived.The report states that current resources to support the teaching of ethnic minority themes is disproportionately focused on slavery, colonialism and Empire, and that positive contributions and role models needed to be celebrated.The report makes 51 recommendations for changes in the new curriculum and teacher training including:The Welsh government has said all of the recommendations in the report had been accepted, and it had allocated £500,000 to help with their implementation.Ms Williams said: \"Our new curriculum can only be enriched by revealing the diversity of perspectives and contributions made by the ethnic minority communities to the development of Wales across its history and in the present.\"Angel Ezeadum, member of UK Youth Parliament for Cardiff, said it was a relief that \"finally we are doing something\" to tackle racism and inequality.The 16-year-old student said she hoped the changes would lead to the next generation of pupils having more opportunity to have a \"different mindset to perhaps their parents or grandparents\".\"If we want a society which is better for all, where there's equality, and there's fair representation then we need this,\" she said.\"It's massive in terms of shaping who young people are going to be in the future whether that's a police officer, a teacher, a politician.\"Plaid Cymru's education spokeswoman Sian Gwenllian said that schools were not required to deliver Welsh history under the newly-passed curriculum law, which was a \"major flaw\".While teaching humanities is one of the learning areas under law, Welsh history and the teaching of BAME stories is included in statutory guidance, called the What Matters Code.\"It has the potential of being transformational in the way our society is developing...and it has been left out [of the law],\" Ms Gwenllian said.\"It has to be mandatory in our schools, otherwise we are not going to be equipping our young people with the information that they want, with the knowledge about where we have come from as a people and as a nation.\"However, the Welsh government said the What Matters Code was mandatory and must be taught to all pupils.\"It is incorrect to claim otherwise,\" a spokesman said.",

    "At the end of January Ade Alabi made a big investment. He bought a four-storey building with two ballrooms, three restaurants, a night club and a radio station, just down the road from Minneapolis's Third Precinct police headquarters.By the end of May it was gone, a heap of rubble and ashes, consumed by the inferno that destroyed the police station and many of the businesses around it. The image of the burning precinct, abandoned by police in the face of angry and violent protesters, signalled for him that something different was happening in Minneapolis.This was the station where the four policemen charged in the killing of George Floyd worked. The explosive reaction to his slow and gruesome death, his neck pinned to the ground by an officer's knee, created momentum to change the way not only the city, but the country, is policed.Nearly five months on, however, ambitious policy efforts to address police violence in Minneapolis have slammed into bureaucratic roadblocks and public opposition. In the charged atmosphere after the Floyd killing, city counsellor Alondra Cano says she \"knew in my gut that we had to do something different… to send a message nationally that would rupture through the traditional approach\", to police misconduct.Reform hadn't worked, she said. It was time now to transform.So in early June a majority of city council members took a step that shook Minneapolis and drew national and international attention. They pledged to dismantle a policing system long accused of racism, and build something new - \"to end policing as we know it\".They then proposed an amendment to the city's charter to put on the November ballot. It called for replacing the police department with a new entity of community safety and violence prevention.The proposal was short on detail but council members said there would be a public engagement process to fill in the blanks.Instead, they faced public opposition, most vocally from North Minneapolis, a largely black neighbourhood, which saw a dramatic rise in gun crime and robberies after Floyd's death. Residents have become so alarmed they are suing the city.\"We have historically had victims of violence by police,\" said Cathy Spann, a community organiser, at a recent neighbourhood gathering. \"But we are under siege right now with gunfire every single night. The council has to bring in extra force to stop this from happening!\"The consensus at the backyard gathering was that the council's declaration had emboldened criminals and demoralised the police department. Whatever the case, dozens of officers have left the force, quitting or claiming medical leave.\"We want to reimagine community policing, desperately, to save the lives of our young black and brown men and women,\" said Jon Lundberg, whose house was hit by random gunfire last week. \"But what we need now is to reinstitute some systems of control. Because right now it's off the hook, it's off the chain.\"Some city counsellors have begun to backtrack given the backlash. Cano is not one of them.She says the proposal was meant to set the direction for a complex and lengthy process.\"Now is where we should be digging deeper and tackling those very important questions around why are we seeing an increase in gun violence and robberies and we shouldn't shy away from that,\" she says.\"That doesn't mean what we did on 7 June doesn't work. What that means is that we're in it and that we need to stay committed and dedicated to solving long-term problems that even our police officers can't solve.\"But those efforts have been set back by the city's charter commission, an appointed state body, which determined that the police amendment was too vague, and put off any vote for another year. In the meantime the council has taken some steps. It diverted $1.1m from the police budget to newly formed community patrols. And Minneapolis has instituted some incremental reforms, such as banning police chokeholds.But Dave Bicking, a veteran activist against police violence, says the council's radical move has done more harm than good.\"The diversion of that pledge and the city charter amendment I think are steps that took away from the chance to make short-term changes to the behaviour of the police department that would have made a difference,\" he says, citing in particular investigation of and discipline for incidents of misconduct and excessive force.In South Minneapolis, another community caught in the line of fire is trying to make its own sense of the city's upheavals.Ade Alabi has banded together with others in the neighbourhood to try to preserve the diverse and distinctive character of the commercial district around the Third Precinct. In the face of enormous rebuilding costs, they are fighting to keep it in the hands of the community rather than lose it to a handful of corporate property developers.They too, talk about transformation, hoping to bring more minority business owners into their corner of the city, and create more cultural and social space. It's something that lawyer Daniel Kennedy, who's part of the collective, calls \"an opportunity that nobody wanted\".The battered police station sits abandoned on this block of destruction. One option being discussed is to hand it over to the community. If nothing else, the killing of George Floyd has shifted the conversation about the function of a police force, even as it has starkly exposed how difficult that is to change.\"I don't want to go back to normal,\" says Meena Natarajan, the owner of a theatre company and another member of the group, \"because normal was racist.\"",

    "The former US police officer charged with the murder of unarmed black man George Floyd has been released from prison on bail.Derek Chauvin posted a $1m (£774,000) bond and was released on Wednesday morning, court records show.The white officer was filmed pressing his knee on Mr Floyd's neck for almost eight minutes before he died on 25 May.Mr Floyd's death led to global protests and calls for police reform, spurred by the Black Lives Matter movement.Mr Chauvin was fired from his job and now awaits trial in March next year on charges of second-degree murder and manslaughter. Three other officers - J Alexander Kueng, Thomas Lane and Tou Thao - were also fired and charged with aiding and abetting murder.All four officers accused in connection with the killing of Mr Floyd in Minneapolis, Minnesota, have now posted bail and are free until their trial next year.Chauvin had been at the maximum-security prison in Oak Park Heights, Minnesota, since late May.In June, a judge set a bail of $1.25m with no preconditions, or $1m with conditions which include Mr Chauvin not contacting Mr Floyd's family, surrendering his firearms and not working in law enforcement or security as he awaits trial.Mr Chauvin was released on conditional bail, which court records showed was guaranteed by a bail-bond agency, CBS Minnesota reported.In the US, bail-bond agents promise to pay authorities the full bail amount for defendants if they cannot afford do so or fail to appear at court.Mr Chauvin was released from custody shortly before 11:30 local time (17:30 GMT) on Wednesday, according to the Hennepin County Sheriff's Office.Ben Crump, a civil rights lawyer representing Mr Floyd's family, said Mr Chauvin's release on bail was a \"painful reminder\" that \"we are still far from achieving justice for George\".\"Although George Floyd was denied justice in life, we will not rest until he is afforded full justice in death,\" Mr Crump said.Currently, all four accused officers are scheduled to face trial together in March, but a judge is considering trying them separately.The incident that led to their prosecution highlighted deep wounds over racial inequality in the US.The Black Lives Matter demonstrations - some of which turned violent - became a central political issue in the run up to November's presidential election in the US.",
    "In the weeks following the death of George Floyd, much has been said about the long struggle by African Americans for equality in the US. It is 57 years this August since civil rights leader Martin Luther King led the March on Washington to demand racial justice.So how much progress have black people in the US made since the 1960s? We've looked at six measures.In 2016, the latest data available, the average wealth of a white family was almost seven times more than a black family in the US. The black-white wealth gap was larger in 2016 than it was in 1983, when black family wealth data was first collected.In the 1960s, the data collected had non-whites all grouped together, rather than in separate groups.The disparity was at a similar level then as in the most recent data, with white families having about seven times more wealth on average than non-white families.  Researchers at the Brookings Institute say: \"The wealth gap reflects a society that has not and does not afford equality of opportunity to all its citizens.\"Wealth is calculated by a family's assets - such as a house or savings - minus their debts.Inheritance accounts for roughly 4% of annual household income in the US - so generational inequalities continue to have an impact, with less money being passed down through black families.In 2016, an average white family's wealth was over $700,000 (£550,000) more than that of an average black family.Although the wealth disparity remains significant, African Americans have become more economically well off since the 1960s.According to the latest data, as of 2019 a smaller proportion live in poverty than ever before, In 2019, the black poverty rate was 18.8% - about half of that in 1966. The white poverty rate has remained relatively steady.There are about 8 million African Americans living in poverty, according to the latest US Census Bureau data.Poverty in the US is calculated by judging if a family's total income is less than the family's needs.If it is, then every person in that family is considered to be in poverty.This is another area in which progress has been made since the 1960s.More African Americans had completed four years of higher education by 2019 than ever before - 26% compared with just 4% in 1962.College attainment by white Americans has also increased since the 1960s - but at about half the rate.The African-American unemployment rate reached a record low of 5.5% in September last year - but it has spiked sharply because of the huge impact of the coronavirus crisis on the US economy. Before this, the white unemployment rate had consistently been about half of the black unemployment rate since records began, in the 1970s.The recent uptick in job losses has also disproportionately affected African Americans - their unemployment rate is 4.6% higher than the overall figure.There hasn't been much movement in the disparity between the wages of black and white Americans either.The average income of black households is just over 60% that of white households, with this disparity barely changing over the past 50 years.Black wages have gone up, but roughly in line with white wages.And today's average wage adjusted for inflation has about the same purchasing power as it did 40 years ago.Progress has been made in black representation in politics, with today's US Congress being the most diverse ever. The current Congress - the US legislative branch of government, made up of the House of Representatives and the Senate - has 55 African-American members, up from 50 in the previous term. As voting rights and protections were expanded during the civil rights movement, the number of black lawmakers increased.The first elected Congress of the 1960s had just four African-American members - but by the end of the 1960s, there were 11.This number has continued to grow and has more than doubled since the start of the 1990s.Read more from Reality CheckSend us your questionsFollow us on Twitter",
    "As protests continue across the US over the death of an African-American man, George Floyd, President Donald Trump has said he's done \"more for the black community than any president since Abraham Lincoln\".He tweeted that he had delivered the lowest African-American unemployment, poverty and crime rates in US history.So how has he done?The African-American unemployment rate reached 13.0% in August this year, the latest data available.It's spiked sharply because of the huge impact of the coronavirus crisis on the US economy. And this has disproportionately affected African-Americans - their unemployment rate is 4.6% higher than the overall figure.But it's worth saying it went as low as 5.5% in September last year - the lowest figure recorded since the US Department of Labor started collecting these statistics in the 1970s.Prior to the coronavirus crisis, there had been a consistent downward trend in African-American unemployment under President Trump.But it's a trend which began under President Barack Obama, who saw the rate decline from 12.6% to 7.5% during his two terms in office from 2009 until 2017.However, there remains a disparity in wages between different groups in the US. The average income of African-American households is almost 60% less than white households, with growth stalling under President Trump, according to the latest statistics.In 2019, the latest data available, the African-American poverty rate was 18.8% - which is the lowest on record, beating the previous year, since the official count began in the 1960s.That represents just over 8 million African-Americans in poverty, according to the US Census Bureau.The US Census Bureau calculates poverty by judging that if a family's total income is less than the family's needs, then every person in that family is considered to be in poverty.Black poverty also came down under President Obama, and was 21.8% in 2016  - his last full year in office.This is hard to answer with any certainty.There are crime statistics gathered by the FBI, but there isn't comprehensive data categorised by race.Violent crime overall has fallen under President Trump, continuing a trend which started after a peak in 1991. When you look at the number of African-Americans arrested - which can give some indication - you can see arrests have come down over recent years.They've remained relatively steady for the last four years. The latest available data is from 2018 and shows that 2,115,381 African-Americans were arrested, according to FBI statistics. Read more from Reality CheckSend us your questionsFollow us on Twitter",
    "Hundreds of people have gathered in the US city of Louisville for a rally to mark a year since the death of Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old black paramedic shot dead when police raided her home.The incident caused outrage, spurring protests against racism and brutality.Ms Taylor was shot by officers who forced entry into her home using a \"no-knock\" warrant that meant they did not have to announce themselves.The three police officers who carried out the raid were eventually sacked.During the operation Ms Taylor's boyfriend Kenneth Walker shot and wounded one of the officers. Earlier this month a charge of attempted murder against him was dropped.Mr Walker said he fired once because he believed criminals were breaking in. The officers responded with 32 shots, six of which struck Ms Taylor.However, a grand jury decided not to charge any of them over Ms Taylor's death, sparking protests.During Saturday's demonstration in Louisville, speakers demanded justice for Breonna Taylor. \"It's been a year and justice has not been served,\" Camille Bascus, a 50-year-old African American, told the AFP news agency.Ahead of the rally, Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear said in a statement that he would \"never understand the unimaginable grief\" of Ms Taylor's family and loved ones. \"Today we remember Breonna Taylor, her tragic and unnecessary loss and the immense work we have ahead of us,\" he said. The FBI's Louisville field office also issued a statement saying that its investigation into Ms Taylor's death had made \"significant progress\" since it began last May, without providing further details. Ms Taylor's killing did not initially attract nationwide attention. But it received renewed focus after the police killing of unarmed black man George Floyd in Minneapolis, which ignited anti-racism protests around the world.By Shrai Popat, BBC News in LouisvilleOn the anniversary of Breonna Taylor's death, her hometown of Louisville is determined that the US doesn't forget her. Flowers, candles and murals of Ms Taylor are centre stage in Jefferson Square Park - dubbed Injustice Square or \"Breewayy\" by many locals. Surrounding roads have been closed off, but many feel that the security measures are excessive for a day of remembrance. \"No-one who organised today asked for these barricades,\" said Attica Scott, a Kentucky state representative. Ms Scott has been a fixture at many of the marches following Ms Taylor's death. She has also proposed a state-wide adoption of \"Breonna's Law\" - the Louisville legislation banning the use of no-knock warrants. \"We're going to keep on fighting,\" she said. The chant \"Say her name\" resounded at the anti-racism protests of last summer, a call for justice for black women in the US. But for many in downtown Louisville, this demand hasn't been met. \"There's always time to arrest, indict and convict the men who killed Breonna Taylor,\" said Lonita Baker, the Taylor family lawyer. So far, that hasn't happened.The city of Louisville paid $12m (£8.6m) to Ms Taylor's family and agreed to police reforms to settle a wrongful death lawsuit.Only one of the police officers who took part in the deadly raid faced any charges linked to the botched raid. Brett Hankison was charged with endangering Ms Taylor's neighbours by firing into a next door apartment.Earlier this week the city of Minneapolis reached a $27m settlement with the family of George Floyd - the unarmed US black man whose death last May sparked protests worldwide.Mr Floyd's death after being trapped under the knee of police officer Derek Chauvin was captured on camera.\"That the largest pre-trial settlement in a wrongful death case ever would be for the life of a black man sends a powerful message that black lives do matter and police brutality against people of colour must end,\" said Floyd family attorney Ben Crump.Jury selection is under way for the murder trial of police officer Derek Chauvin, who was filmed with his knee on Mr Floyd's neck as he begs for his life and says \"I can't breathe\". He was later pronounced dead in hospital.",
    "CrossFit owner Greg Glassman has sold his fitness company, after stepping down as chief following outcry over remarks he made about George Floyd.The comments, in which he asked why he should mourn for Mr Floyd, had prompted athletes, gyms and sportswear firms to cut ties with the business.Incoming owner Eric Roza, a tech executive and co-founder of a successful CrossFit gym, said he would be \"working hard to rebuild bridges\".Terms of the deal were not disclosed.The value of the Crossfit business, which is based on a branded exercise regimen focused on high intensity workouts, has previously been estimated at about $4bn (£3.1bn). It is affiliated with about 13,000 gyms in 158 countries worldwide.\"In the past weeks, divisive statements and allegations have left many members of our community struggling to reconcile our transformative experiences in the local box with what we've been reading online,\" said Mr Roza, a former Oracle executive who is now working for US venture capitalists General Catalyst. \"My view is simple: Racism and sexism are abhorrent and will not be tolerated in CrossFit.\"In early June, Mr Glassman had courted controversy by responding to a public health body on Twitter that was saying racism was a public health issue.Mr Glassman tweeted: \"It's FLOYD-19\", an apparent reference to the coronavirus.He followed it up with a second tweet saying: \"Your failed model quarantined us and now you're going to model a solution to racism? George Floyd's brutal murder sparked riots nationally.\"He also called an affiliate \"delusional\" for questioning why CrossFit had been silent on the killing in Minneapolis.Hours before posting the fateful tweets, Mr Glassman had told gym owners on a private Zoom call that was leaked to reporters: \"We're not mourning for George Floyd - I don't think me or any of my staff are.\"Can you tell me why I should mourn for him? Other than that it's the white thing to do.\"The comments prompted affiliate gyms to drop CrossFit branding and were rebuked by athletes, as well as Adidas-owned Reebok, which said it was ending its partnership with the brand. The backlash set off further reports that alleged incidents of sexism at the firm.In a statement this month announcing his retirement, Mr Glassman acknowledged that he had \"created a rift in the CrossFit community and unintentionally hurt many of its members\".He added: \"I cannot let my behaviour stand in the way of HQ's or affiliates' missions. They are too important to jeopardise.\"On Wednesday, in its announcement of the new owner, CrossFit shared a statement from Mr Glassman, which said it was \"time\" for him to move on.\"The world has changed but the magnificent human machine, the proven benefits of CrossFit, and its market opportunity remain unchanged,\" he said.Mr Glassman's retirement was the latest corporate fallout from the protests set off by George Floyd's death in the hands of police, which have reignited discussions of racism and prompted many firms to speak out.",

    "A Manchester mural paying tribute to George Floyd has had a \"sickening\" racist slur spray painted on it.The portrait, in the city's Stevenson Square, was painted by artist Akse P19 in memory of Mr Floyd, who died after being arrested in the US in May.The city's council said it would \"do everything we can to find out who committed this abhorrent crime\".CCTV footage is being reviewed by police in an attempt to identify the person who caused the damage. The defacement is believed to have happened overnight and was discovered by Greater Manchester Police officers on a routine patrol in the area earlier.A force spokesman said an investigation into the \"racially aggravated criminal damage\" had begun, but no arrests had been made.Akse P19, who has since repaired the mural, said he was \"disgusted\" by what had happened. \"I do not tolerate racism as I have suffered from it since childhood,\" he said.\"It just emphasises the need to carry on the fight against racism.\"Manchester City Council's deputy leader Nigel Murphy said it was \"utterly sickening that this type of behaviour exists in our society\".\"We will do everything we can to find out who committed this abhorrent crime,\" he added.\"Manchester is a place that celebrates our diversity and we will not tolerate hate in our city.\"Mr Floyd's death prompted Black Lives Matter protests across the world, including a rally in Manchester.Local group Black Lives Matter Manchester said the graffiti was \"horrible\" and \"explicitly racist\", but added it would \"take a lot more than a few individuals with markers and spray cans to stop us standing on the side of justice\".Why not follow BBC North West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram?

    "Protesters in Utah who splashed paint on a prosecutor's office could be given life sentences after they were accused of acting as a \"gang\".Salt Lake City District Attorney Sim Gill, whose office was targeted by Black Lives Matter marchers issued the charges. Critics, including the city's mayor, have called the felony charges excessive.The paint splashing occurred during a 9 July protest against racism.According to Utah's criminal code, the \"gang enhancements\" felonies Mr Gill filed are applied to \"offences committed in concert with two or more person or in relation to a criminal street gang\". In effect, prosecutors are \"calling participants in a protest gang members,\" a lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union told AP.Mr Gill, a Democrat who says he declined to charge other Black Lives Matters protesters for curfew violations, downplayed the potential serious life sentence such charges carry. He did not think \"anyone is going to be going to prison on this,\" he said. Plea deals are said to be often used in cases such as these to avoid a full sentence.\"There's some people who want to engage in protest, but they want to be absolved of any behaviour,\" Mr Gill said. \"This is not about protest. This is about people who are engaging in criminal conduct.\"However, Mayor Erin Mendenhall condemned the gang upgrade, saying the \"potential punishment facing some protesters is excessive\".  \"While I believe there should be consequences for breaking the law, the potential to spend life in prison for buying paint is too severe,\" she said in a video on her Twitter account.Seven suspects are face first-degree felonies for allegedly buying or transporting the paint, splashing it on the government property or breaking windows, according to the Salt Lake Tribune.Lawyers for the accused told the newspaper the charges were retaliatory and a conflict of interest, because the protest took place at Mr Gill's office and protesters have repeatedly called him out by name.Mr Gill agreed that it was \"not the ideal solution\" to have his office file the charges, since they are the alleged victim, but he said short-staffing due to the coronavirus pandemic required it. He said the case will ultimately be handled by another district attorney's office. Madalena McNeil, 28, one of the protesters who is facing a life sentence, said: \"I was really shocked because I just don't think any of the allegations against me warrant life in prison\". She was charged for buying paint and pushing an officer.She told CBS that she feels confident that she will not receive such a long sentence, but \"it would be silly to look at the potential of life in prison and not be scared\".",

    "The sister of George Floyd, whose death in police custody sparked months of racial turmoil across the US, has urged civil rights protesters to \"be his legacy\" as thousands gathered for a rally in Washington DC.\"My brother cannot be a voice today,\" said Bridgett Floyd. \"We have to be that voice, we have to be the change\".Ms Floyd was one of several relatives of black Americans harmed or killed by police to address the event commemorating a historic 1963 civil rights march.Speakers demanded racial justice and urged people to vote.Jacob Blake Sr, whose son was shot in Wisconsin on Sunday, told the rally they were holding court on racism in America - and the verdict was \"guilty, guilty, guilty!\".Thousands of people gathered in Washington DC for the event that commemorated the 1963 civil rights March on Washington and in protest at police violence.Called the Commitment March: Get Your Knee Off Our Necks - a reference to the death of George Floyd, who died in May after a policeman knelt on his neck for several minutes - it follows renewed protests over the police shooting of Jacob Blake.The event brought together generations of activists to call for police reform and to urge Americans to vote in November's general election. It was organised by civil rights leader Reverend Al Sharpton and Martin Luther King III - the eldest son of Mr King Jr.The families of black Americans shot or killed by police spoke at the same site where Martin Luther King Jr delivered his I Have a Dream speech.The 1963 March on Washington was a seismic event in US history, credited with spurring the passage of the Civil Rights Act outlawing segregation the following year. Some 250,000 supporters packed the 1.9 miles (3 km) strip from Lincoln Memorial to the Washington Monument, making it one of the largest political gatherings the country had ever seen. Rev Sharpton announced the 2020 march - which falls on the 57th anniversary of the 1963 event - at Mr Floyd's memorial service in June. His organisation, the National Action Network, worked with Mr King III to convene the rally.\"The nation has never seen such a mighty movement, a modern day incarnation of what my father called the coalition of conscience,\" said Mr King III. \"And if we move forward with purpose and passion, we will complete the work so boldly began in the 1960s.\"The event comes in the wake of at times violent protests over Mr Blake's shooting that have left two dead in Kenosha, Wisconsin. Mr Blake was shot and injured by police.Since Mr Floyd's death in May, marches in support of the Black Lives Matter movement and against racism and police brutality have swept the US and the globe. BBC's Sam Cabral and Shrai Popat in Washington DCAttendees lined along Constitution avenue as early as 7am in anticipation of the march. Lloyd Miner travelled from Philadelphia as says: \"I'm here to play my role and give this administration the mandate that we mean what we say: we want change,\" he says. For Rex Ikwueme there's a sense of urgency.\"We're in a crisis and we really have got to get things in order,\" he says. \"We can't be living like this and we can't be seeing my people die on film every week. That's not normal.\"\"Clearly with the way that the police have been behaving in different areas of the country, they're looking at us as targets and we can't have that,\" he continued. \"It contradicts the entire American dream.\"Police violence against African-Americans is top of mind today for many marchers.Artelia Bryant, from Roanoke, Virginia, says in her opinion, little has changed since 1963.Bryant wants lawmakers and law enforcement held accountable for the deaths of black people in police custody.Where do they start?\"Cops being arrested,\" says Bryant. \"They can start with the cops that killed Breonna Taylor.\"Many called for the immediate passage of national police reform legislation known as the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, named after the late civil rights icon and congressman. Patrick Reyes travelled to Washington from Brooklyn, New York. He points out the 57 years since the first March on Washington saw seminal policies like the Voting Rights Act - a landmark law designed to protect minority voters - but says empty legislation has followed since then: \"Voter suppression still exists today.\"\"We're not asking for it, we're not requesting it,\" said Reyes. \"We're demanding justice.\"Speakers during the morning's programming included congresswoman Ayanna Pressley, who paid tribute to the activism of black Americans of the past whose \"sacrifice and self-determination shaped history and brought us to this moment\".\"We are Black with a capital B,\" she said. \"We are the manifestation of the movement. We are a symbol of social, political and cultural progress.\"Other presenters included a young activist who called for an end to the gun violence that plagues black communities, and representatives from unions, gay rights groups and Hispanic activism groups, who expressed solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement.Democratic vice-presidential nominee Senator Kamala Harris addressed the rally virtually. Harris, who grew up in an activist household, paid tribute to civil rights leaders of the past. \"Let's March on for our ancestors and let's march on for our children and grandchildren,\" she said.Among the initiatives on the agenda were slavery reparations, defunding police departments and investment in healthcare, housing and social services in black communities, organisers said. It was drafted by hundreds of delegates from across the country.",
    "It's just a few miles short of 4,000 in fact, no more than a stone's throw considering how fast the shock and anger over George Floyd's death in police custody have swept around the world. Some of the strongest reactions have come in areas like ours which are home to diverse communities including those of African-Caribbean heritage. The enduring rage, the sense of burning injustice, rekindles yet again the often toxic arguments surrounding racial discrimination and double standards in the treatment of white people and black people.  Dave Thompson, the chief constable of West Midlands Police, England's second largest force, recognised the significance of this right from the start:\"Young black people right across the West Midlands will rightly feel strongly about these events and the fact they are in the US makes no difference,\" he warned. \"They affect how policing is seen on our streets.\"Reminding us that he had a great deal of contact with policing in the States, he concluded: \"It is so very different to what we have in the UK.\"How fair is it for the demonstrators, including the thousands who gathered in Birmingham this week, to carry posters alleging that \"the UK isn't innocent\"?Mr Thompson acknowledged serious concerns about recent incidents in which his officers had been accused of using unnecessary force against black men. The regional director of the Independent Office for Police Conduct, Derrick Campbell, confirmed that the IOPC was currently investigating nine such cases in Birmingham alone this year.    The police commissioner for the West Midlands, David Jamieson, takes the matter so seriously that he is giving the public an opportunity to question the police about their use of force. This must surely count as a clear example of democratic accountability in action. Remember, Mr Jamieson is himself an elected Labour politician.Though the police here may have serious questions to answer, at least they are subject to political and investigatory scrutiny.    Compare this with the disturbing picture of policing in America which emerged during a BBC News at Ten report on Wednesday 3 June 2020 by Clive Myrie. Having covered the US on and off for nearly three decades, he told us:\"Policing in America is opaque. There is little transparency. Powerful unions can protect bad cops and the principle of qualified immunity means officers accused of misconduct are almost always given the benefit of the doubt. The policing system is fragmented to the point of farce. There are 18,000 different forces. In California, training can last 24 to 48 weeks. In North Carolina, just 16 weeks to become a police officer; half the time to become a licensed barber in the state.\"So beware glib comparisons about policing on opposite sides of the Atlantic. They may be equally glaring examples of double standards.None of us needs to be reminded that the outrage surrounding the death of George Floyd coincides with the relentless and increasingly fractious atmosphere that's built-up during the Covid-19 emergency, like one thing on top of another.Our BBC West Midlands News Online pages reporting on the protests here have been viewed in their hundreds of thousands, prompting Facebook comments which are mostly critical of the apparent disregard for social distancing. Some even venture that among those now taking such a tolerant view of the rules may be at least some of the campaigners who have been giving Dominic Cummings such a hard time over his \"minor infringement\".          Perhaps that's enough double standards for now.",
    "People who arrived from the Caribbean to start a new life in Britain 72 years ago have been celebrated at a virtual event to mark National Windrush Day.Race Council Cymru hosted the occasion to mark the second annual Windrush Day.HMT Empire Windrush arrived in Essex on 21 June 1948 and its almost 500 passengers disembarked the next day.In March, a review found \"profound institutional failure\" led to some being deported, detained or losing their right to work or NHS treatment.Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford, who attended the online event, thanked them for the \"huge contribution they had made to both our country and our culture\".In the aftermath of World War Two, the UK saw huge investment and bombed cities were rebuilt, transport systems expanded and new institutions, such as the NHS, had to be staffed, so people from all over the Commonwealth came to help fill the labour shortage.Monday's event provided an opportunity for members of the Windrush generation and their relatives to share their thoughts on the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement and their experiences of racism.In recent weeks, protests have taken place around the world after George Floyd, an unarmed black man, died in police custody in Minneapolis in the United States.There have been several protests in Wales and more than 30,000 people have signed a petition to make it compulsory for slavery, colonialism and the impacts on black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) communities to be taught to Welsh schoolchildren.But what do the Windrush generation make of the changes in society over the past 72 years?It was October 1958 when 15-year-old Roma Taylor travelled to Wales from Antigua to be reunited with her with her mother and brother.She went on to found Windrush Cymru Elders in 2017, a group which brings together older people from diverse communities across Wales.Mrs Taylor, 76, said: \"The only time I had a problem with racism was when I was in the Army - I was about 50 then.\"I went swimming with some friends and a little girl looked at me and said 'you're black'. \"She probably didn't see many black people though so that didn't hurt me.\"Mrs Taylor lived in the Cardiff docklands community of Tiger Bay when she came to the city. \"My Tiger Bay\", she described it.\"You did not get racism in Tiger Bay, not that I know of because I didn't get any. It was fabulous!\"But as the years went on, racism became more of a feature in her life: \"One of my little girls, when she was five, said that the teacher told her 'you must go back and sit in the corner you little monkey'.\"She said police were stopping black boys more than ever and she was disgusted by the death of George Floyd.\"I cried for the whole week. I've been crying for a week because that really hurts,\" she said.\"People are angry because when the Windrush came over to rebuild Britain, they came over and they worked hard and did the dirtiest work.\"They kept themselves to themselves and never got into problems.\"But after seeing what they did to George Floyd, this generation is angry. You can see it in their faces... we haven't progressed at all.\"She said the younger generation would not \"stand for any nonsense\".\"They're not like us - we zipped our mouths and took everything that they threw at us.\"But Mrs Taylor is hopeful of change: \"Every child should be taught [black history]. It's deep, but fabulous and wonderful\".An 11-year-old Hadassah Radway came from Jamaica to Newport with her siblings in 1967.The former teacher, now 63, said she was one of only five black families in her school.  She said the the colour of her skin meant she was not seen as clever and had to work hard to prove herself. \"When I was growing up they used to throw banana skins,\" she said.She said during her 30 years teaching she experienced sniggering and often felt humiliated.\"One student said to me 'Africa is back that way. What are you doing here?'\"She said the experience left an \"indelible mark\" and all she wanted was for the child to be taught about race equality.\"Black history and our contribution has been whitewashed from our curriculum and it is time for it to come back,\" she said. Ms Radway was concerned about protests happening during the Covid-19 pandemic, especially as statistics show more people from BAME groups are dying from the virus than those from white ethnic groups. She said the fact the younger generation was still fighting for change \"says a lot about how far we still need to go\".She added: \"When my father came here and others like him in the 60s, they had to fight. They were fighting for their lives in places like Pillgwenlly [in Newport] where they were being attacked because of the colour of their skin.\"She said it was time for policies that bring about \"real change\" for her community.",

    "Facebook has removed a number of Justice for George Floyd groups for exhibiting \"inauthentic behaviour\". BBC News had highlighted some suspicious groups had switched their focus to call for justice for the black man killed in police custody.Some, run by accounts seemingly based in Vietnam or Bangladesh, had posted misleading images.And others had previously focused on coronavirus, 5G conspiracies and support for US President Donald Trump. A Facebook spokesman said it had \"removed the vast majority of them, for violating our policies\".There has been a surge in membership for Facebook groups supporting the Black Lives Matter movement, following the protests sparked by Mr Floyd's death, on 25 May.But for some it is unclear what the motives of their administrators are.In some cases, they could be exploiting the movement to gain followers and/or stoke tensions.Some of the profiles based outside the US had frequently posted inflammatory images and videos before Facebook intervened.One group, Justice for George Floyd, had almost 2,000 members. Set up in March, it originally focused on the coronavirus but later that month switched to \"US breaking news\", featuring stories sympathetic to the US president, before turning to Black Lives Matter.In its final incarnation, two administrators - identified as in Vietnam - had repeatedly shared posts critical of the protesters, including images of battered police cars that predate the current protests.Another group, Justice For George Floyd & Latest Updates, was run by a profile claiming to be based in Bangladesh.The administrator's profile photos had all been copied from other websites and included images of celebrities and animals.And it used highly emotive language in contradictory posts that supported both the police and the protesters.Others included:This would not be the first time Black Lives Matter groups have been hijacked.Investigations into foreign interference during the 2016 US presidential election accused Russia of being behind a misinformation campaign that had taken advantage of the movement.However, no evidence has been presented to indicate Moscow is involved this time.",
    "George Floyd, 46, died after being arrested by police on 25 May in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Footage of the arrest shows a white police officer, Derek Chauvin, kneeling on Mr Floyd's neck while he was pinned to the ground.Mr Floyd's death triggered a wave protests across the United States. ",
    "A new name is being sought for a university building named after former Prime Minister William Gladstone who had links with the slave trade.The University of Liverpool agreed to rename Gladstone Hall after students campaigned for its removal in June.Gladstone spoke out against abolition in Parliament because his family had slaves on plantations in the 1800s.The university said it was \"determined to address contemporary racism\" and wanted ideas by 19 March.Students and staff have been asked to come up with names linked to the theme of racial equality and Liverpool for the halls of residence.The decision to change the building's name follows Black Lives Matter protests in the city in response to the death of American George Floyd and the tearing down of a statue of slave trader Edward Colston in Bristol.Liberal politician William Ewart Gladstone was born in Liverpool in 1809, who is described as having \"ultra-conservative\" views and used his maiden speech in the House of Commons to support his father's interests, arguing against abolition.When slavery was abolished in the 1830s, the Gladstones received more than £90,000, about £9.5m in today's terms, as compensation for the slaves they were forced to free.Students campaigned over the issue for several years, arguing that the University of Liverpool should not be honouring people who benefited from slavery.A spokesman said it was \"determined to address the consequences of contemporary racism and racial inequality\".\"It is important that the names used within the university, including our halls of residence, reflect the values of openness, transparency and respect that underpin our work,\" he added.",

    "An avid sports fan, father and brother, Floyd is laid to rest in Houston as those close to him mourn his loss.As George Floyd is laid to rest in Houston, family members and friends remember the man who spawned a movement.According to those who knew him, he was a man who drew people in with his kindness in the Third Ward of Houston where he grew and everywhere else he went. Floyd was remembered by family members as a man everyone wanted to be around. Philonise Floyd, George’s brother, said he was like “a general” that everyone wanted to follow.Growing up in a single-parent household, Floyd was remembered as a loving, supportive and guiding presence by his siblings at a memorial in Minneapolis last week.“He was like a big brother,” Terai Lawson, who grew up in Houston, told National Public Radio in an interview that aired on Tuesday morning.Terai is the younger brother of Ortierre Lawson, Floyd’s friend and former football teammate.Terai said Floyd took an interested in his sports life. “I always mysteriously see him in the stands, watching me play basketball all the way through high school,” Terai said.Ortierre, who played football with Floyd at Yates High School, remembered him as a man who carried the team through challenging times with his good nature and support.At practices in the blistering Houston heat, their football coach would not allow water breaks, Ortierre said. To help his team get through the tough practices: “Someone like Floyd would bust out singing,” Ortierre remembered in conversation with NPR.“When he would start singing and the whole team would start singing.”Floyd helped the football team make the state championships during his time at Yates High School. State championships are a monumental accomplishment in Texas, where football is often considered a second religion for residents.Floyd was an avid sportsman. He was 6’4″ (194cm) and loved basketball. He was a huge fan of LeBron James, star player for the Los Angeles Lakers who made his mark on basketball with the Cleveland Cavaliers.“He was the biggest LeBron James fan,” Floyd’s nephew Brandon Williams recalled at his eulogy service in Minneapolis. When James won the championship with the Cavaliers against the Golden State Warriors in the 2016 NBA finals, Floyd was elated.“When the [Cavaliers] came back on the Golden State Warriors in the Finals, and I remember the very first phone call. I told him, ‘You’re too happy. You sound like you won a championship.’ “Floyd responded: “Man, you know how I feel about LeBron. I did win a championship”.James commented on Instagram about Floyd’s killing by former Minneapolis Officer Derek Chauvin on May 26, juxtaposing the image of Chauvin kneeling on Floyd’s neck with that of former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick.Kaepernick protested against police brutality and racial injustice by taking a knee during the US National Anthem at football games starting in the 2016 season.Kaepernick received support from many but was also criticised by the NFL and others, even Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, for his protest.James captioned his post with “Do you understand NOW”?An 'eerie' parallel of two knees: Floyd's death renews debate on Kaepernick protesthttps://t.co/yIyANGitiC pic.twitter.com/oecYjBoyOO— ABC Columbia (@abc_columbia) June 3, 2020James also posted a photo of himself wearing a shirt emblazoned with the words “I can’t breathe”, which were the last words of both Eric Garner, killed in New York in 2014, and Floyd.Michael Jordan, another legendary basketball player, said his “heart goes out” to the Floyd family in a May 31 statement.After graduating from Yates in 1993, Floyd went to South Florida Community College where he played basketball for two years. He then transferred to Texas A&M University in Kingsville, where played basketball until he dropped out.Floyd was also a musician, rapping with a group called the Screwed Up Click in Houston’s hip-hop scene in the 1990s.Floyd went to prison in 2009 after armed robbery and home invasion charges were brought against him.He was paroled in 2013 and returned to Houston, where residents say he supported and upheld the community as a leader and mentor.Floyd moved to Minneapolis in 2014 to look for employment. He worked as a truck driver and bouncer there, until he lost his job due to the coronavirus pandemic in 2020, shortly before his death.Floyd was 46 when he died. He is survived by five children. Chauvin, the officer who held Floyd down, had his third-degree murder charge upgraded to second-degree murder and also faces a second-degree manslaughter charge.The three other officers present when Floyd was killed face charges of aiding and abetting second-degree murder and manslaughter. All four have been fired from the Minneapolis police force. Floyd’s death sparked a movement that is drawing calls to defund the police, but according to DJD, another Lawson brother and friend of Floyd who spoke to NPR, he cannot help but remember his “brother”. “To see one of your best friends on TV all day long … it’s just another person to everybody and a movement to everyone else. But it’s a friend to me. I don’t see George Floyd. I see Big Floyd.”",
    "Documents and video evidence provide a detailed – and at times contradictory – account of the day Floyd was killed.The killing of George Floyd on May 25 has triggered unprecedented protests in the United States, with curfews being imposed in cities across the country and President Donald Trump briefly evacuated to a bunker during a night of violent demonstrations.One former police officer involved in the killing, Derek Chauvin, has been charged with second-degree murder and manslaughter. Three other officers at the scene – Thomas Lane, J. Kueng and Tou Thao – were charged with aiding and abetting second-degree murder. All four of the officers had already been fired. Here’s what happened on the day Floyd died, according to publicly available documents and news reports:A transcript (PDF) of the emergency call between someone working at a shop where Floyd allegedly attempted to pay for goods with a counterfeit $20 bill details the events leading up to the police call, from the shopkeeper’s perspective.The person at the shop, whose name is redacted, claimed they asked Floyd to return cigarettes that he purchased with the allegedly fake $20 bill. Floyd refused and was “awfully drunk”.However, the caller said Floyd didn’t appear to be leaving the premises and remained in his car.“Alright, I’ve got help on the way. If that vehicle or that person leaves before we get there, just give us a call back, otherwise we’ll have squads out there shortly, okay?” the 911 dispatcher said.According to the criminal complaint (PDF) against Chauvin, police arrived at the scene at 8:08pm local time.It said officer Thomas Lane was speaking to Floyd, who was in the driver’s seat of his car. Lane pulled his gun on Floyd until he put his hands on the steering wheel.Lane then “pulled” Floyd out of the car. The complaint said Floyd “actively resisted being handcuffed”, but then became compliant.Mahmoud Abumayyaleh, the owner of the shop where Floyd used the allegedly counterfeit bill, told CNN he reviewed his own surveillance footage and saw no resistance from Floyd when officers attempted to take him into custody.At 8:14pm, as Floyd was being led to the police car, he “fell to the ground, and told the officers he was ‘claustrophobic'”.Floyd was allegedly noncompliant with getting into the car, according to the complaint. He “struggled with the officers by intentionally falling down”, it said.After apparently getting him into the vehicle, at 8:19pm Chauvin “pulled” Floyd “out of the passenger side of the squad car”. Floyd “went to the ground face down and still handcuffed”.Chauvin placed “placed his knee in the area of Mr Floyd’s head and neck”, the complaint said. Officer Kueng held Floyd’s back and Lane held his legs.Floyd repeatedly told officers he couldn’t breathe multiple times, saying “please” and “Mama”, both the complaint and harrowing video of his death show.Chauvin’s knee remained on Floyd’s neck, and the other officers did not change positions. They told Floyd he was “talking fine” in response to his claims that he could not breathe.Lane asked Chauvin: “Should we roll him on his side?”Chauvin responded: “No, staying put where we got him.”Lane said he was “worried about excited delirium or whatever”.Excited delirium is a condition characterised “by agitation, aggression, acute distress and sudden death, often in the pre-hospital care setting”, according to research from 2011.The designation has been around since the 1800s, but has gained recent notoriety for its use in explaining deaths involving police officers, the study said.While more research was needed at the time, “it is important to note that a lack of recognition of the condition in the context of law enforcement activities does not negate the significance of the behavioral and physical signs”, it said.Chauvin said in response to the expressed concern about excited delirium, “That’s why we have him on his stomach.”At 8:24pm, Floyd stopped moving. A minute later, “the video appears to show Mr Floyd ceasing to breathe or speak”.A police officer checked his pulse and said, “I couldn’t find one” at 8:25pm. The officers remained in their positions.At 8:27pm, Chauvin took his knee off Floyd’s neck.“The defendant had his knee on Mr Floyd’s neck for 8 minutes and 46 seconds in total,” the complaint said. “Two minutes and 53 seconds of this was after Mr Floyd was non-responsive. Police are trained that this type of restraint with a subject in a prone position is inherently dangerous.”Two autopsy reports released on Monday – one from county officials and another from independent experts – both listed Floyd’s death as a homicide. However, they differ in the cause.The independent report found Floyd died from “asphyxiation from sustained pressure”, resulting from Chauvin’s knee and body weight being placed on Floyd’s neck, with other officers kneeling on his back.The Hennepin County medical examiner’s office lists Floyd’s cause of death as “Cardiopulmonary arrest complicating law enforcement subdual, restraint, and neck compression”.Cardiopulmonary arrest means Floyd’s heart failed. There was no mention of asphyxiation. The county report also lists the presence of fentanyl, an opioid similar to morphine, in his system and “recent methamphetamine use”.However, the report does not say how much of either drug Floyd ingested.The cause of death was listed as “Homicide”.The report stated the manner of death “is a statutory function of the medical examiner, as part of death certification for purpose of vital statistics and public health”.The report’s determination on Floyd’s death “is not a legal determination of culpability or intent, and should not be used to usurp the judicial process”, it added.Lawyers for Floyd’s family told CNN: “Whether or not he was intoxicated or had medications in his system is irrelevant to the cause of death, which is homicide, which is death by the hand of another.”The US has erupted in protests over Floyd’s death.More than 350 cities have seen demonstrations and National Guard troops, a component of the US Army, have been deployed in at least 23 states to handle the sometimes violent demonstrations.Looting has also been common.Media members, demonstrators, and medics have faced excessive force from police. Some police officers have marched alongside demonstrators in certain cities, avoiding conflict.Trump and members of his government have called for harsh crackdowns on the protests, and threatened to designate Antifa, a loose conglomeration of anti-fascist activists, as a “terrorist” organisation.Trump has also threatened to deploy the military to deal with the unrest, prompting criticism and accusations.",
    "Four Minneapolis officers fired after the death of George Floyd, who died after being pinned down by a white officer.A Black man who yelled “I cannot breathe” as a white Minneapolis police officer pinned him down with his knee in the US state of Minnesota died late on Monday, police confirmed, drawing outrage from community members and leaders, and leading to the officers’ termination. Video of the incident shows the police officer pinning down George Floyd, believed to be in his 40s, to the pavement with his knee on the man’s neck for several minutes. Floyd was identified by prominent civil rights lawyer Ben Crump, who said he had been retained by the Floyd family. Floyd can be heard saying in the video: “Please, please, I cannot breathe.”The officer tells Floyd to “relax”.Floyd responds: “I can’t breathe. Please, the knee in my neck.”The officer continues to hold down Floyd with his knee for several minutes, with Floyd pleading and asking for water.“My stomach hurts. My neck hurts. Please, please. I can’t breathe,” Floyd cries out, while moaning and trying to cough.Floyd eventually appears motionless under the officer’s knee.Those who were watching the incident unfold can be heard begging police to move off Floyd.“He’s not f****** moving,” an onlooker can be heard saying. “Get off of his f****** neck.”It is unclear what happened before and after the video was taken.Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo said during a news conference on Tuesday that the four officers involved in the incident were now “former employees”. The city’s mayor, Jacob Frey, confirmed that the officers had been terminated, saying “this is the right decision for our city”. Four responding MPD officers involved in the death of George Floyd have been terminated.This is the right call.— Mayor Jacob Frey (@MayorFrey) May 26, 2020In a statement earlier on Tuesday, the Minneapolis Police Department said its officers were responding to a “report of a forgery in progress”.“After [the suspect] got out [of his car], he physically resisted officers,” the statement said. “Officers were able to get the suspect into handcuffs and note he appeared to be suffering medical distress.”He was then transported to a nearby medical centre where he died a short time later, the department said.The Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehensive (BCA) said it was “investigating the circumstances surrounding an incident”.It added that it was sharing information with the FBI, which “is conducting a separate federal civil rights investigation at the request of the Minneapolis Police Department.”Arradondo has said he requested the FBI involvement after receiving additional information “from a community source”. He did not elaborate. The police officers involved in the incident were wearing body cameras, the Minneapolis police department said. The footage has not been made publicly available. Community members and leaders have expressed outrage over the incident, with many drawing comparisons to Eric Garner, an unarmed Black man who died in 2014 after being placed in a chokehold by New York City police and pleading: “I can’t breathe.” That incident sparked nationwide protests. “We all watched the horrific death of George Floyd on video as witnesses begged the police officer to take him to the police car and get off his neck,” Crump, the Floyd’s lawyer, said in a statement on Tuesday.“This abusive, excessive and inhumane use of force cost the life of a man who was being detained by the police for questioning about a non-violent charge,” he added. “How many ‘while Black’ deaths will it take until the racial profiling and undervaluing of black lives by police finally ends?”Nekima Levy Armstrong, a local lawyer and prominent activist, wrote on Facebook that this “is trauma on trauma on trauma”.“We can’t escape police violence even in a global pandemic,” she added.Minneapolis Police officers killed a Black man last night by placing a knee on the back of his neck while he was handcuffed and lying on the ground. This is pure evil. This is what we are dealing with here. Eric Garner Part 2: Trigger warning: Graphic: https://t.co/beqIdpyGxe— Nekima Levy Armstrong (@nvlevy) May 26, 2020Minneapolis Mayor Frey called the incident “wrong on every level”.“Being black in America should not be a death sentence,” he said in a Facebook post.“This officer failed in the most basic, human sense,” he added. All I keep coming back to is this: this man should not have died … To our Black community, to the family: I’m so sorry.”Others said that while the firing of the officers involved was a good first step, they should also be prosecuted. “The actions of the officers involved are inexcusable and warrant swift consequences,” said Leslie Redmond, the president, Minneapolis chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP).  “Their actions represent a dangerous precedent set forth by the racist, xenophobic, and prejudicial sentiment in our society against Black people. We witnessed a violation of our human rights, and we must hold all involved criminally accountable for the death of Mr Floyd,” she said in a statement.  Hundreds of protesters rallied in Minneapolis later on Tuesday to express outrage and demand greater action. Organisers urged participants to wear masks and adhere to social distancing guidelines due to the coronavirus pandemic.Protesters chanted “I can’t breathe” and “no justice, no peace” as they moved from the intersection where Monday’s incident occured to the police precinct where the officers involved worked. Video of the protests showed police using tear gas on demonstrators. Police said some protesters damaged police vehicles and a window of a precinct.  Video- pic.twitter.com/5bert02z8Z— Evan Frost (@efrostee) May 26, 2020Monday night’s incident comes on the heels of several cases of Black men and women being killed by police or former law enforcement across the US.The FBI is investigating the police shooting death of Breonna Taylor in Louisville, Kentucky. Taylor, a Louisville emergency medical technician, was killed by police in the early hours of March 13 as she laid in her bed. Police said they were serving a warrant as part of a drug investigation when they returned fire from the apartment. Taylor’s boyfriend said he was firing in self-defence, believing his home was being broken into. No drugs were found in the apartment. One officer was injured.The US Department of Justice is weighing possible hate crime charges in the US state of Georgia over the shooting death of Ahmaud Arbery, an unarmed Black man, and the police handling of the case.Arbery was killed in February as he ran through a predominantly white neighbourhood in Glynn County, Georgia. The arrests of Gregory McMichael, a retired investigator for the local prosecutor’s office, and his son, both of whom are white, came more than two months after the incident and only after a video of the shooting went viral, raising questions about the handling of the case. Police have also since arrested the man who filmed the incident.The Georgia Bureau of Investigation is also investigating the shooting death of Yassin Mohamed, a Sudanese American man, who was killed by police on May 9 after having “several altercations” with law enforcement in the 24 hours before his death. Police say they fired on Mohamed after he charged officers with a large rock. The Council on American-Islamic Relations in Georgia has condemned the incident and called for answers, including whether Mohamed was suffering from mental health issues.#GeorgeFloyd is not an isolated incident.

According to the database, Black Americans are killed by police at a disproportionate rate. African American adults are nearly six times as likely to be imprisoned or jailed than white adults, according to the Sentencing Project watchdog group.These racial disparities have given rise to Black Lives Matter, which was founded in 2013 and seeks to end police violence and build local power to intervene in violence inflicted on Black communities.",
    "Protests over the US police killings of Black people have spread across the US, and worldwide.The police killing of George Floyd, an unarmed Black man, in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on May 25 sparked protests across the United States and worldwide.A video of the incident shows Derek Chauvin, a white police officer, kneeling on Floyd’s neck for nearly nine minutes as the 46-year-old pleaded: “I can’t breathe.” Following the killing, protests erupted in at least 140 US cities, with thousands of people taking to the streets against police violence. While protests have remained largely peaceful, looting, vandalism and fires have taken place in some cities. The police have also used tear gas and other non-lethal projectiles on protesters, including on peaceful gatherings.  National Guard troops were activiated in more than 20 states, and several cities imposed temporary curfews.Here is a timeline of the protests:George Floyd, a 46-year-old African American man, dies after a white Minneapolis police officer pins him to the ground with his knee on Floyd’s neck.A video of the incident is widely shared on social media.“Please, please, I cannot breathe,” Floyd can be heard in the video as Chauvin continues to kneel on his neck. Minneapolis residents and community leaders express outrage over the incident with many drawing comparisons to Eric Garner, an unarmed Black man who died in 2014 after being placed in a chokehold by New York City police and pleading: “I can’t breathe.” Hundreds in the city protest against Floyd’s killing and demand the four officers involved be held accountable.The four officers involved in Floyd’s deadly arrest are fired.Protests against police brutality spread to other US cities, including Memphis, Tennessee, Los Angeles, California, and Louisville, Kentucky, where 26-year-old Breonna Taylor was killed by white police months earlier. Looting and fires are seen in some parts of Minneapolis and other cities. The view of the protest from the top of a building next door. @mprnews pic.twitter.com/prBI5cJl1g— Evan Frost (@efrostee) May 26, 2020A state of emergency is declared by Minneapolis   Mayor Jacob Frey. Meanwhile, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz activates the National Guard.Protesters overrun a police precinct in Minneapolis and the building is set on fire as demands grow for charges to be brought against the four officers involved in Floyd’s deadly arrest. Protests continue to spread across the US. President Donald Trump sends out a tweet blaming the violence on a lack of leadership in Minneapolis and threatens to send in the National Guard. Many respond with outrage after he calls the protesters “thugs”. As protests grow, Chauvin is charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter over Floyd’s death. Twitter hides one of Trump’s tweets, saying the president violated its policies on “glorifying violence” by his apparent call for the military to use force against the protests in Minneapolis. Secret Service agents rush Trump to a White House bunker as hundreds of protesters gather outside the president’s residence.Our country allows for peaceful protests, but there is no reason for violence. I’ve seen our citizens unify & take care of one another through COVID19 & we can’t stop now. My deepest condolences to the family of George Floyd. As a nation, let's focus on peace, prayers & healing.— Melania Trump (@FLOTUS) May 29, 2020Minneapolis Mayor Frey compares the protests to “domestic terrorism”. Protesters remain undeterred. What started as largely peaceful protests for George Floyd have turned to outright looting and domestic terrorism in our region. We need you to stay home tonight.— Mayor Jacob Frey (@MayorFrey) May 30, 2020The Pentagon puts active-duty members of the army on standby for deployment to Minneapolis as protests continue across different cities in the US.The US sees some of the largest protests yet, with demands growing for the three other officers involved in Floyd’s death be arrested and charged. Some 350 officers of the Minnesota National Guard and local police are deployed to enforce a curfew in Minneapolis. In Minneapolis, the driver of a tanker truck drives into a massive crowd of demonstrators. No protesters appear to be injured and the driver is arrested.US media report scuffles between Secret Service officers and protesters in front of the White House as demonstrators return to the area, leading to a White House lockdown. Police use tear gas and other non-lethal projectiles on protesters, including members of the press. My security advisor and I were shot with rubber bullets tonight.

It said Floyd suffered “other significant conditions”, including heart disease and hypertension, fentanyl intoxication and recent methamphetamine use.There aren’t many things more momentarily terrifying than a crowd of scared people running your way. This happened a few times near the White House as police set off flash bangs to push back protesters. In the moment, no one’s sure what the sound is & panic ensues 🎥: @iAMSHOOTER pic.twitter.com/A18RBbvtVi— Malika Bilal (@mmbilal) June 1, 2020Thousands take to the streets with many going to the site of Floyd’s death.Public health experts express serious concerns over COVID-19 spread. “It could be … devastating,” Kathleen Sebelius, former US health secretary, says, adding that protesters have a responsibility to get tested so as not to infect family and friends. Health experts worry specifically about the use of tear gas on protesters, saying it causes people to remove masks and touch their eyes. Prosecutors level new criminal charges against four Minneapolis officers involved in the death of Floyd. Chauvin, already jailed on charges of third-degree murder and manslaughter, is charged with second-degree murder.The added charge, defined under Minnesota law as unintentionally causing another person’s death in the commission of a felony offence, can carry a sentence of up to 40 years, 15 years longer than the maximum sentence for third-degree murder.Three fellow officers fired from the Minneapolis police department along with Chauvin the next day are charged – each with aiding and abetting both second-degree murder and manslaughter.Hundreds gather in Minneapolis for the first of several planned memorials for Floyd. “George Floyd’s story has been the story of Black folks. Because ever since 401 years ago, the reason we could never be who we wanted and dreamed to be is you kept your knee on our neck,” said Reverend Al Sharpton, who eulogised Floyd. “It’s time for us to stand up in George’s name and say, ‘Get your knee off our necks!'” Those in attendance and hundreds who gathered outside the event space held an 08:46-minute moment of silence at the end of the service.  Tomorrow we will lay out how we will mobilize nationally in the name of #GeorgeFloyd, AhmaudArbery, #BreonnaTaylor, and more.

Tens of thousands rallied in Washington, DC, New York City, and elsewhere. Meanwhile, outraged protesters from Sydney to London continue global rallies against racism and police brutality. “It is time to burn down institutional racism,” one speaker shouted through a megaphone outside the Houses of Parliament in London. “Silence is violence,” the throng shouted back in the rain.Protests continue as people take to the streets to show their support for the Black Lives Matter movement.Protesters target Confederate statues and symbols across the US south, with some being toppled by demonstrators and others being removed by cities or defenders of the monuments. Protesters in the English city of Bristol topple a statue of a 17th-century slave trader.Demonstrators attached ropes to the statue of Edward Colston before pulling it down to cheers and roars of approval from the crowd and dumping it in the river.In Brussels, protesters clambered onto the statue of former King Leopold II and chanted “reparations” daubing the word “shame” on the monument. Historians estimate that some 10 million people died during Leopold’s brutal rule of the Congo. Calls to defund police departments across the US grow. Nine of the 12 Minneapolis council members – a veto-proof majority – announce plans to disband the city’s police department. They later say they will work with the community to determine the details of the plan. Thousands of mourners attend a public viewing of Floyd in Houston, Texas, where Floyd grew up. They line up for hours to file through the doors of The Fountain of Praise church, which Floyd attended for most of his life, and past the open gold-coloured coffin where he lay dressed in a brown suit. Meanwhile, Democrats propose legislation to reform police practices but stop short of endorsing activists’ calls to “defund the police”.The funeral service for Floyd begins in Houston, Texas, with family members and invited dignitaries filing into The Fountain of Praise church to pay their respects. The funeral – broadcast live – is in part a celebration of Floyd’s life and in part a call to action to continue to demand the end of police brutality. Floyd’s brother testifies at a House Judiciary Committee hearing on issues of racial profiling, police brutality and lost trust between police departments and the communities they serve.“I’m tired. I’m tired of the pain I’m feeling now and I’m tired of the pain I feel every time another Black person is killed for no reason,” Philonise Floyd says during his testimony.“Teach them what necessary force is,” he says. “Teach them that necessary force should be used rarely, and only when life is at risk.” He also reminds the panel that police were called because his brother had allegedly used a counterfeit $20 bill.Minneapolis police promise reforms, as the Minneapolis Police Department will withdraw from police union contract negotiations, Chief Medaria Arradondo says as he announces the first steps in what he said would be transformational reforms to the department.Army General Mark Milley, the US’s highest-ranking military officer, said he was wrong to have accompanied Trump on a walk to a church outside the White House, where he was photographed in his combat uniform with the presidential entourage.“My presence in that moment and in that environment created a perception of the military involved in domestic politics,” Milley said. “As a commissioned uniformed officer, it was a mistake that I have learned from, and I sincerely hope we all can learn from it.”Trump meanwhile attacks leaders in Washington state over actions taken by protesters there. Protesters and self-described anarchists have created what they are calling a “Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone”, occupying several city blocks after police vacated a precinct there. Trump on Twitter demands Seattle’s mayor and Washington’s governor to “take back” the city. Mayor Jenny Durkan shoots back, tweeting: “Make us all safe. Go back to your bunker.” Protesters in large US cities are expected to continue demanding an end to police brutality.",
    "Friends and relatives pay tribute to the Black man who suffocated under the knee of a white policeman in Minneapolis.George Floyd, the unarmed Black man who suffocated under the knee of a white policeman in the United States city of Minneapolis, has been described as “a loving person” and a devoted father who worked hard to support his family.“Everybody loved my brother,” Philonise Floyd said on Tuesday, a day after the killing that sparked nationwide protests and growing demand for justice amid renewed accusations of systemic racism in the US.“He’s a gentle giant,” he told CNN. “He don’t hurt anybody.”The late 46-year-old moved to Minneapolis from his native Houston several years ago in hopes of finding work and starting a new life, according to Christopher Harris, Floyd’s lifelong friend.But he lost his job as a security guard at a restaurant when Minnesota’s governor issued a stay-at-home order as part of measures to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus. Harris told The Associated Press news agency he had spoken to Floyd on Sunday night and gave him some information to contact a temporary jobs agency.Floyd grew up in Houston’s Third Ward, one of the city’s predominantly Black neighbourhoods, where he and Harris met in middle school.At an imposing two metres (6.6 feet), that earned him the nickname “gentle giant”, Floyd became a star athlete in basketball and football at a young age.“Quiet personality but a beautiful spirit,” Donnell Cooper, one of Floyd’s former classmates said. His death “definitely caught me by surprise. It’s just so sad, the world we’re living in now”.Floyd was charged in 2007 with armed robbery in a home invasion in Houston and in 2009 was sentenced to five years in prison as part of a plea deal, according to court documents.Harris, Floyd’s childhood friend, said he and some of their mutual friends had moved to Minneapolis in search of jobs in around 2014. Harris said he talked Floyd into moving there as well after he got out of prison.“He was looking to start over fresh, a new beginning,” Harris said. “He was happy with the change he was making.”Floyd found a job as a security guard at a Salvation Army store in the city centre of Minneapolis.Later, he started working two jobs, one driving trucks and another as a security guard at Conga Latin Bistro, where he was known as “Big Floyd”.“Always cheerful,” Jovanni Tunstrom, the bistro owner, said. “He had a good attitude. He would dance badly to make people laugh. I tried to teach him how to dance because he loved Latin music, but I couldn’t because he was too tall for me. He always called me ‘Bossman’. I said, ‘Floyd, don’t call me Bossman. I’m your friend’.”On Monday evening, Minneapolis police arrested Floyd because he allegedly matched the description of someone who attempted to pass off a counterfeit $20 bill at a store to buy cigarettes.In a widely circulated video of the arrest, Floyd can be seen on the ground with his hands cuffed behind his back. Officer Derek Chauvin pressed him to the pavement with his knee on Floyd’s neck. The video shows Chauvin holding Floyd down for minutes as Floyd complains he cannot breathe. The video ends with paramedics lifting a limp Floyd onto a stretcher and placing him in an ambulance.His sister, Bridgett Floyd, said it was “heartbreaking” for him to die at the hands of police.“That’s exactly what they did,” she told NBC News. “They murdered my brother. He was crying for help.”Roxie Washington, the mother of his six-year-old daughter in Houston, described him as a devoted father.“People mistake him because he was so big that they thought he was always a fighting person,” Washington said, according to the Houston Chronicle.“But he was a loving person … and he loved his daughter.”One of Floyd’s longtime friends, Stephen Jackson, became an NBA basketball star, but Floyd never let that change their friendship.“We called each other Twin,” Jackson said in an emotional video post on Instagram.“He was changing his life,” moving to Minnesota for work so he could support his children, Jackson added. “My boy was doing what he was supposed to do, man, and you all go and kill my brother.”Floyd’s girlfriend, Courtney Ross, said he had remained a shining light in the community.“This is nothing but an angel that was sent to us on earth,” she told CBS News. “And we demonised him, and we killed him.”Chauvin was fired by the Minneapolis police department on Tuesday, along with three other officers who were also at the scene. On Wednesday, Mayor Jacob Frey called for Chauvin to be criminally charged, without mentioning the other officers.On Friday, after days of protests, Chauvin was taken into custody and charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter by state prosecutors.",

Police told the TV station “things are escalating, not de-escalating”.Crowds rallied in different parts of the city, with some chanting “Prosecute the police” and “I can’t breathe”.Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner has urged protesters to remain peaceful after a group of people demonstrating against Floyd’s death blocked highway entrances and threw objects at police officers.Some protesters clashed with police in downtown Houston, Texas, with officers deploying tear gas or pepper spray to disperse crowds.Organisers believe more than 3,000 people gathered with Black Lives Matter Houston to protest Floyd’s death with chants of “I can’t breathe” and “No justice, no peace”.Turner said some were arrested for attempting to block roads, but no injuries were reported.

Let’s keep the focus on the life that was lost,” he said.“I can tell you not to go out and demonstrate but the reality is it’s going to happen,” Hancock said at a news briefing, stressing he shared outrage over what he has called the “senseless and tragic murder” of Floyd in Minneapolis.Hancock blamed what he called a minority of agitators among peaceful protesters for inciting violence downtown on Thursday. That violence included throwing rocks at police officers, setting small fires, and breaking windows and damaging cars at the state Capitol and at businesses.A police car was set on fire in Atlanta, where protesters used barricades to break the windows of cruisers while others jumped on the vehicles and shattered windshields as they demonstrated against the death of Floyd.Hundreds of protesters confronted police outside CNN’s downtown headquarters.

It’s very simple, nobody should have any problem with this other than the haters, and those looking to cause trouble on social media. Honor the memory of George Floyd!” Trump said. The phrase “looting leads to shooting” was first used, however, by former Miami Police Chief Walter Headley in declaring war on criminals, according to the Washington Post. “I’ve let the word filter down that when the looting starts, the shooting starts,” Headley reportedly said.A fired Minneapolis police officer has been charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter in the death of George Floyd, Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman said.Former officer Derek Chauvin knelt on Floyd’s neck for several minutes before the Black man went motionless, a video of the incident showed.   Minneapolis residents called the arrest a good “first step” but demanded the three other officers involved be arrested and charged as well. Freeman said those officers are still under investigation.According to local media, the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension has taken into custody former officer Derek Chauvin, who knelt on Floyd’s neck for several minutes before the Black man went motionless. No criminal charges have been filed as of yet.Former President Barack Obama issued a statement on Floyd’s killing via Twitter. Obama cited conversations with friends in recent days, including one with an African American business owner who said Floyd’s killing “hurt” to watch.While it’s “natural” for people to want things to return to normal, Obama said, “we have to remember that for millions of Americans, being treated differently on account of race is tragically, painfully, maddeningly ‘normal’.”My statement on the death of George Floyd: pic.twitter.com/Hg1k9JHT6R— Barack Obama (@BarackObama) May 29, 2020“This shouldn’t be ‘normal’ in America.

The National Guard said about 500 members would be sent to the area. The on-air arrest of CNN journalist Omar Jimenez, who is Black, was condemned by Dorothy Tucker, president of the National Association of Black Journalists (NABJ). “It is unfathomable and upsetting to witness this structural racism in real time.

A live video stream by Unicorn Riot, an independent media organisation, showed protesters eventually entering the precinct and alarms and sprinklers going off as some rooms were set ablaze. Police were evacuated from the building “in the interest of the safety of our personnel”, police said in a statement, which added that “protesters forcibly entered the building”. Protesters outside the police building could be heard yelling: “We’re sick and tired of being sick and tired.”Minnesota Governor Tim Walz called in the US National Guard and declared a state of emergency for the Twin Cities area, which includes Minneapolis and Saint Paul. The city of Minneapolis also declared a 72-hour local emergency. Earlier on Thursday, a small group of protesters “occupied” the space outside the home of Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman, who will handle the case, to demand criminal charges for the four officers – identified as Derek Chauvin, Thomas Lane, Tou Thao and J Alexander Kueng – involved.“We aren’t going anywhere until Mike Freeman prosecutes and charges the officers,” protesters said in a Facebook Live video, with at least one tent put up on the pavement outside the county attorney’s home.Freeman’s office said in a statement on Tuesday it was “shocked and saddened by what appeared in a recent video”.It said it would make a decision on prosecution after it receives the completed findings of the investigations by the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension and the FBI.Freeman said on Thursday his office would work through the case “as expeditiously, as thoroughly as justice demands”. “We just can’t rush this,” Freeman said. “These need to be done right. Please give me and give me the United States attorney time to do this right and we will bring you justice.”Thursday’s protest followed similar demonstrations in Minneapolis that have taken place for the last two days. Floyd’s death has been compared with that of Eric Garner, an unarmed Black man who died in 2014 after police put him in a chokehold. Some of Garner’s last words were: “I can’t breathe.”While the protests started peacefully, they descended into chaos with reports of looting, arson and vandalism.Police used tear gas and non-lethal projectiles to disperse the crowds, drawing anger from residents.“The way the police – MPD – have been treating people, having been treating the community, have been treating young people is incredibly frustrating,” said Ramla Bile, a Somali American Minneapolis resident. “Seeing all the sophisticated gear that they have is disgusting,” she told Al Jazeera.Bile said she found it especially frustrating that “for a city where we are continuing to talk about inequity and disparities … we continue to funnel money to the police” instead of investing in these communities. Protests also took place on Thursday in cities across the US, including Columbus, Ohio, Oakland, California and New York City, where dozens of people were reportedly arrested. Hundreds also rallied in Louisville, Kentucky, to protest against police brutality and draw attention to the killing of Breonna Taylor who was shot dead by police in March as they served a search warrant. At least seven people were shot at the protest, police said on Thursday. One person is in a critical condition and no arrests have been made, police said.#BlackLivesMatter protest #GeorgeFloyd pic.twitter.com/Nxssshw9bk— Gili Getz 🔥 (@giligetz) May 28, 2020In Denver, Colorado, hundreds of people descended on the state capitol. Police confirmed that shots were fired near the area where the protest was taking place. It is unclear if the shots were related to the protest. Police said there were no immediate reports of injuries.Several more protests are scheduled for Friday and over the weekend.Several prominent activists and sports starsm meanwhilem took to Twitter to express outrage over Floyd’s death and support for those protesting.Rights activist and former National Football League player Colin Kaepernick, who took a knee during the national anthem at US football games to protest against police brutality, tweeted: “We have to fight back!”When civility leads to death, revolting is the only logical reaction. The cries for peace will rain down, and when they do, they will land on deaf ears, because your violence has brought this resistance.We have the right to fight back! Rest in Power George Floyd— Colin Kaepernick (@Kaepernick7) May 28, 2020“When civility leads to death, revolting is the only logical reaction,” Kaepernick said in support of the protesters. “The cries for peace will rain down, and when they do, they will land on deaf ears, because your violence has brought this resistance.”In a joint statement on Thursday, US Attorney Erica MacDonald and FBI Special Agent In Charge Rainer Drolshagen said the US Department of Justice had made the investigation into Floyd’s death a “top priority”.US President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly been accused of stoking racial tensions, on Thursday said he and his administration were “very much involved”.He said the video of Floyd’s arrest was a “very shocking sight”, but he declined to say whether he believed the officers should be charged.In the early hours of Friday morning, Trump called the protesters participating in any looting and setting fires “thugs” and warned the military “will assume control” if needed.“Just spoke to Governor Tim Walz and told him that the Military is with him all the way. Any difficulty and we will assume control but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts. Thank you!” the president tweeted without elaborating. Twitter later hid Trump’s tweet, saying it violated the platform’s rules on glorifying violence. Back in Minneapolis, Mayor Jacob Frey, who has called for the arrest of the officer who pinned Floyd down, said on Thursday the city’s anger is “not only understandable, it’s right”.“‘What we’ve seen over the last two days and the emotion-ridden conflict over the last night is the result of so much built-up anger and sadness … that has been ingrained in our Black community – not just because of the five minutes of horror, but for 400 years,” he said.For communities of colour in Minneapolis, however, the words of politicians ring hollow. “At this point, it’s status quo,” Minneapolis resident Bile said. “And status quo in the middle of a pandemic when we’ve been disproportionately harmed by everything that’s been going on on top of the existing disparities, we are being suffocated.”",
    "Several US states activate National Guard troops as protests over police killings of unarmed Black people grow.Latest updates:Between 2013 and 2019, police in the United States killed 7,666 people, according to data compiled by Mapping Police Violence, a research and advocacy group. On May 26, 2020 at 9:25pm (02:25 GMT, May 27), George Floyd, a 46-year-old resident of Minnesota, became yet another victim of police brutality as he was killed by an officer while unarmed.Floyd’s death has prompted thousands of protesters to march in cities around the country demanding justice and an end to police violence. The number of police killings in the US disproportionately affects African Americans. Despite only making up 13 percent of the US population, Black Americans are two-and-a-half times as likely as white Americans to be shot and killed by the police. The map below shows how disproportionate these killings are across the US’s 50 states.Donald Trump said on Sunday that the US will designate Antifa as a “terrorist organisation” accusing the anti-fascist network of the violence seen in several cities across the country.The United States of America will be designating ANTIFA as a Terrorist Organization.— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 31, 2020Antifa, short for anti-fascist or Anti-Fascist action, is a fringe movement, a loose collection of organisations and ideas with no party line and no formal leadership, but its fight against the far right has found centre stage in the polarised climate of Trump’s America.Minnesota Governor Tim Walz said on Sunday state authorities were hit by cyber attackers before law enforcement launched operations on Saturday to clear protests.Walz described the incident as a “a very sophisticated denial of service attack” and said it was executed on “all computers”. He did not offer additional details.Walz pointed to the hack as evidence that unrest in his state in recent days has been stoked by coordinated, outside groups trying to sow mayhem.“That’s not somebody sitting in their basement,” he told reporters on Sunday. “That’s pretty sophisticated.” Minnesota authorities say 20 percent of those arrested had out-of-state addresses.President Donald Trump will not invoke federal authority over the National Guard for now, National Security Adviser Robert O’Brien said on Sunday.“We’re not going to federalise the guard at this time,” O’Brien told reporters at the White House, saying law enforcement decisions should rest with governors and mayors.“In city after city, we are witnessing actions that could be considered unnecessary or excessive force. We call for an immediate end to any such use of force and for law enforcement to ensure and protect the legal right to protest,” Rachel Ward, National Director of Research at Amnesty International USA, said in a statement.According to the human rights group, police tactics used so far can trigger escalating violence. “Equipping officers in a manner more appropriate for a battlefield may put them in the mindset that confrontation and conflict are inevitable,” read the statement, adding that police “should demilitarize their approach and engage in dialogue with protest organizers”.Protests turned violent in the city of La Mesa near San Diego, California where demonstrators set buildings ablaze.“Fires continue burning across the city. Protests have been ongoing since early this morning,” Hunter Sowards, a reporter from local KUSI News media, said in a tweet. The City of La Mesa has enacted a curfew beginning May 31st from 1:30AM-7:00 AM. Fires continue burning across the city. Protests have been ongoing since early this morning. City leaders urge people to go home. @KUSINews pic.twitter.com/W7IBD3qLNL— Hunter Sowards (@huntersowards3) May 31, 2020The city is under curfew from 1.30am (8.30am GMT) until 7am (2pm GMT).“We don’t need a curfew, we need change,” Mia, a 20-year resident of Minneapolis told Al Jazeera. Going home would “[send] the wrong message that they can shut us up when they want to, and that’s not the case here”, she said, as protesters have promised to remain in the streets at least until all four officers involved in Floyd’s death have been charged.Read Lucien Formichella’s full story here.The brother of George Floyd said he was not given “the opportunity to even speak” when President Donald Trump called the Floyd family on Friday.“It was so fast. He didn’t give me the opportunity to even speak. It was hard,” Philonise Floyd told MSNBC.“I was trying to talk to him but he just kept like pushing me off like ‘I don’t want to hear what you’re talking about’,” he said.“And I just told him I want justice, I said I can’t believe they committed a modern day lynching in broad daylight. I can’t stand it,” Philonise Floyd added. “I just want to understand, why do we have to go through this?”Protesters in Atlanta said they had to take to the streets to protest against police brutality despite the dangers associated with the coronavirus pandemic.“It’s not OK that in the middle of a pandemic we have to be out here risking our lives,” Spence Ingram, a Black woman marching in Atlanta, told The Associated Press news agency.It came as health experts and officials raised concerns over the virus’s spread during the protests that keep gripping major cities across the US.“If you were out protesting last night, you probably need to go get a COVID test this week,” Atlanta Mayor Keisha Bottoms said, adding that “there is still a pandemic in America that’s killing Black and Brown people at higher numbers”.Two members of a Reuters TV crew were shot with rubber bullets in Minneapolis shortly after a curfew as they were covering the protest.“My security advisor and I were shot with rubber bullets tonight. He had PRESS labeled clearly and visibly on his bulletproof vest,” one of the two reporters, Julio-Cesar Chavez, said in a tweet as he posted a photo of a previous moment when a police officer was aiming directly at him.My security advisor and I were shot with rubber bullets tonight.

Police spokesman John Elder requested a copy of the video.San Francisco Mayor London Breed has declared the implementation of a citywide curfew starting on Sunday at 8pm (03:00 GMT).“People are hurting right now. They’re angry. I’m angry,” she said on Twitter, as she announced the decision.“The city and the police will support peaceful protests, as we did all day today,” however, she added, “We can’t tolerate violence and vandalism.

Now is the time to go home.— London Breed (@LondonBreed) May 31, 2020Joe Biden, the presumptive US Democratic presidential nominee, said in a statement early on Sunday that:  “We are a nation in pain, but we must not allow this pain to destroy us.”“These last few days have laid bare that we are a nation furious at injustice. Every person of conscience can understand the rawness of the trauma people of color experience in this country … like the horrific killing of George Floyd,” the former vice president said.“Protesting such brutality is right and necessary … But burning down communities and needless destruction is not. Violence that endangers lives is not. Violence that guts and shutters businesses that serve the community is not.”We are a nation in pain, but we must not allow this pain to destroy us. We are a nation enraged, but we cannot allow our rage to consume us. Please stay safe. Please take care of each other. https://t.co/Y224rANwUF— Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) May 31, 2020The mayor of Los Angeles says the National Guard will be deployed overnight to help local law enforcement as protests continue in the country’s second-largest city. Mayor Eric Garcetti says he asked California Governor Gavin Newsom on Saturday to send 500 to 700 guardsmen. Crowds of demonstrators have torched police cars, vandalised and burglarised shops and clashed with officers. Hundreds of people have been arrested since Friday night. Police have used tear gas to disperse the crowd. Protests are continuing in Salt Lake City despite a curfew issued by the mayor and National Guard troops deployed by Utah’s governor.Police officials say they are prepared to give people time to leave, but they plan to arrest people who refuse to comply.What started as a peaceful demonstration on Saturday against the death of George Floyd turned destructive. A group of people flipped over a police car and torched it. A second car was later set on fire.Police officials say six people have been arrested and that a police officer was injured after being struck in the head with a baseball bat.The National Guard has been deployed in Washington, DC, as pockets of violence erupted during a second straight night of protests.Hundreds of protesters converged on the White House during the day on Saturday and marched on the National Mall, chanting “Black lives matter,” “I can’t breathe” and “No justice, no peace”.

That was in 2014 when the police shot and killed 17-year-old Laquan McDonald.” (Read more about that police killing here.)Lucien Formichella in Minneapolis, Minnesota: “There was a tense moment here in Minneapolis earlier when what was believed to be a drunk man attempted to drive his car through the protest area. The situation was de-escalated by protesters, and the man was sent back. Protesters then erected makeshift barricades to stop cars from driving down the street.”Rob Reynolds in Los Angeles: “As night falls the standoff between protesters and police continue.”Mike Hanna in Washington, DC: “The demonstrations here have been largely peaceful through the course of the day and indeed in the course of the evening. There had been some scuffles.

The Metropolitan Police Department said there were break-ins at a Target and a shopping centre that houses major retailers, a cinema and specialty stores. Police said several individuals were detained.The truck company that owns the semi-truck that drove through thousands of people marching on the Minneapolis highway said in a statement that it was informed of an incident involving one of its independent contractors and it would be cooperating with investigating authorities.Video showed the lorry had a logo on its side for “Kenan Advantage Group,” an Ohio-based transportation company.Read about the incident here. San Diego police said officers fired tear gas to disperse a crowd of demonstrators that was pelting them with rocks and bottles.Hundreds of people, many with facial masks to protect against the coronavirus, marched through downtown chanting “George Floyd” with signs, including some saying “I can’t breathe,” a reference to Floyd’s dying words when a Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee on the back of his neck. Some demonstrators dropped to one knee at times.The demonstration began peacefully at 10am. San Diego police said on Twitter that a crowd of 100 to 200 people was throwing rocks but stopped. Authorities said multiple vehicles were vandalised.Minnesota’s state attorney general Keith Ellison said on Sunday he will lead the prosecution of the case involving the killing of George Floyd.It with a large degree of humility and a great seriousness, I accept for my office the responsibility for leadership on this critical case involving the killing of George Floyd.

The incident is being investigated as a criminal matter”, the Minnesota Department of Public Safety tweeted. The driver has reportedly been arrested. Video of the incident appears to show the lorry barrelling towards a large group of demonstrators, who split in time to avoid harm. No injuries have been reported, though circumstances remain unclear. Minnesota Governor Tim Walz announced that Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison will head the prosecution in the case surrounding George Floyd’s death. Former officer Derek Chauvin was charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter days after Floyd’s death.Ellison asked in a Fox News appearance on Sunday that the public be patient. “To ask people to be patient who have suffered so long and been denied justice so long is really asking a lot of them, but if you want to make sure that this case results in a successful prosecution, you’ve got to understand the defence attorneys who are going to be on the other side are very skilful and they will try to break every single link in the prosecutorial chain,” Ellison said before the appointment. Video shared on social media show protesters kneeling and sitting to hold moments of silence nationwide.Many lasted for eight minutes and 46 seconds – the amount of time a white police officer knelt on George Floyd’s neck in Minneapolis.8 minute 46 second moment of silence in Murfreesboro TN rally today. pic.twitter.com/0mNuXtO6ea— Teresa Taylor (@Lemons_N_Laughs) May 31, 2020A semi-truck appeared to drive into a crowd of protesters marching down a Minneapolis freeway, live video showed.Video shows a large group of protesters parting and running as the lorry barrels towards them.It then comes to a stop and protesters run towards it.It is unclear what happens next and whether there are any injuries. Protesters and residents in the area told Al Jazeera that the scene is very chaotic. Warning: Graphic footage. BREAKING- Truck moves at full speed into a crowd of thousands of demonstrators #GeorgeFloyd #Minnesota @KSTP pic.twitter.com/pUscK8JgFB— Brett Hoffland (@BrettHoffland) May 31, 2020Two police officers have been fired and three others placed on desk duty for excessive use of force during a protest arrest incident, Atlanta’s mayor said.Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said at a news conference that she and Police Chief Erika Shields made the decision after reviewing body-camera footage of a Saturday night incident that first gained attention from video online and on local news.“Use of excessive force is never acceptable,” Bottoms told reporters. Shields called the footage “really shocking to watch”.The video, shown on TV as captured by local reporters, shows a group of police officers in riot gear and gas masks surround a car being driven by a man with a woman in the passenger seat. The officers pull the woman out and appear to use a stun gun on the man. They use zip-tie handcuffs on the woman on the ground. The couple did not appear to be fighting police.Former NBA star Michael Jordan said in a statement that he is “deeply saddened, truly pained and plain angry”.“I stand with those who are calling out the ingrained racism and violence toward people of color in our country.

Governor Brian Kemp said more would be ready on Sunday for demonstrations planned in Athens, Savannah and other cities.Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms signed an executive order on Sunday extending the curfew in the city, according to text and email notifications sent to residents. It takes effect at 9pm on Sunday and will end at sunrise.Atlanta police said on Sunday they had arrested more than 150 people overnight as protesters threw rocks at officers and broke windows in the downtown area. That brought the total number of arrests during two nights of protests to nearly 230.Officials in Philadelphia announced plans to close much of the centre of the city Sunday after peaceful protests over George Floyd’s death turned into a night of destruction with store windows smashed near City Hall, merchandise looted from stores, and police and other vehicles and structures set ablaze.But television news helicopter footage on Sunday afternoon showed people running into multiple stores in northeast Philadelphia, well outside the city centre, and emerging with merchandise as disorder continued for a second day elsewhere in the city.Peaceful protest at police HQ #phillyprotests #philly #phillyprotest pic.twitter.com/XlRwGNbaT6— DEFUND PPD (@twomuchbrew4u) May 31, 2020Philadelphia Police Commissioner Danielle Outlaw said much of the city centre would be blocked off, affecting roads, bridges and expressway entrances and exits, as well as the city’s transit agency. The Benjamin Franklin Bridge between Philadelphia and Camden, New Jersey, was closed until further notice.An 8pm (00:00 GMT) curfew in the city announced earlier was moved up to 6pm (22:00 GMT) on Sunday, and retail establishments were ordered to close immediately, with people cleaning or securing vandalised properties ordered to finish up and return home by 5pm (21:00 GMT) so that the curfew could be enforced.Local television showed live aerial shots for more than an hour on Sunday afternoon of people running from store to store in strip malls in northeast Philadelphia’s Port Richmond neighbourhood, emerging with armfuls of merchandise as police units tried to keep up.San Francisco’s mayor and police chief said on Sunday the city’s 8pm (03:00 GMT) curfew would be extended indefinitely and that people who are out after that time would be stopped.Mayor London Breed said Governor Gavin Newsom had approved sending in about 200 extra officers from other agencies.England footballer Jadon Sancho joined protests across German football at the weekend by lifting his jersey after scoring to reveal a T-shirt with the handwritten message “Justice for George Floyd” on the front.Sancho was shown a yellow card for his gesture which came after he scored a second goal for Borussia Dortmund against Paderborn on Sunday.Earlier, Marcus Thuram took a knee after scoring in Borussia Monchengladbach’s win over Union Berlin.The Gladbach striker scored in the first half and then dropped his left knee to the ground and rested his right arm on his right thigh as he bowed his head in reflection. Thuram spent five seconds in this position before getting up again to continue.“No explanation needed,” Gladbach FC said on Twitter, with a picture of Thuram kneeling.The mayor of the nation’s capital said on Sunday that violence and vandalism from the previous night’s protests were committed by “an organised group that appeared more bent on destruction than protest”.Muriel Bowser also acknowledged what she described as the legitimate grievances of the peaceful protesters.Bowser and Police Chief Peter Newsham toured the city around 3am (07:00 GMT) on Sunday, assessing dozens of broken windows, damaged storefronts and a few looted shops.In a news conference, Newsham said 17 protesters were arrested, and he expected more arrests as police examine security camera footage.A contingent of 500 members of the DC National Guard remain on standby and will continue to be deployed to assist local security, Bowser said.____________________________________________________________________Hello and welcome to Al Jazeera’s continuing coverage of the protests in the US over the deadly arrest of George Floyd in Minneapolis, Minnesota. This is Laurin-Whitney Gottbrath in Louisville, Kentucky, Lucien Formichella in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and Creede Newton in Washington, DC. Here are a few things to catch up on:See the updates from Friday and Saturday night’s protests here and  here  . ",
    "The video captures an apparent lack of urgency to render aid to Floyd for long minutes after he stopped moving.Body-camera footage made public Wednesday from two Minneapolis police officers involved in George Floyd‘s arrest captured a panicked and fearful Floyd pleading with the officers in the minutes before his death, saying “I’m not a bad guy!” as they tried to wrestle him into a squad car.“I’m not that kind of guy,” Floyd says as he struggles against the officers. “I just had COVID, man, I don’t want to go back to that.” An onlooker pleads with Floyd to stop struggling, saying, “You can’t win!” Floyd replies, “I don’t want to win!”A few minutes later, with Floyd now facedown on the street, the cameras record his fading voice, still occasionally saying, “I can’t breathe” before he goes still.Though transcripts of the footage were released earlier, the video itself is the fullest public view yet of Floyd’s interaction with the officers who were later charged in his death. It also captures an apparent lack of urgency to render aid to Floyd for long minutes after he stopped moving.The recordings from officers Thomas Lane and J Alexander Kueng are part of the criminal case against them and two other officers in Floyd’s May 25 death in the United States. Derek Chauvin, who held his knee against Floyd’s neck for nearly nine minutes, is charged with second-degree murder. Lane, Kueng and another officer, Tou Thao, are charged with aiding and abetting.All four officers were fired the day after Floyd died. Journalists and members of the public were allowed to view the footage Wednesday by appointment. Judge Peter Cahill, without explanation, has declined to allow publication of the video.The footage shows the officers’ view of a death already widely seen on a bystander’s mobile phone video, which set off tumultuous protests in Minneapolis that quickly spread around the world and sparked a national reckoning on race and policing.Floyd appears distraught from the moment officers ask him to step out of his vehicle near a south Minneapolis corner grocery, where he was suspected of passing a counterfeit $20 bill. When Floyd did not immediately display his hands, Lane pulled his gun, leading Floyd to say he had been shot before.Floyd’s hands are soon handcuffed behind his back, and he grows more anxious, telling the officers that he’s claustrophobic and pleading with them not to put him in the back of a squad car.In the struggle, Floyd loses a shoe. What appears to be Chauvin’s chest-mounted body camera winds up underneath the squad car, and Floyd eventually winds up on the pavement with the officers holding him down.Chauvin and Kueng each grip one of Floyd’s handcuffed hands to hold them in position behind his back, with Kueng’s knee appearing to press on Floyd’s bottom or just below. Lane is at Floyd’s feet.The officers sound clinical as the minutes tick by. “I think he’s passing out,” one officer says. “You guys all right, though?” someone asks. “Yeah – good so far,” says one. Another – apparently Lane – says: “My knee might be a little scratched, but I’ll survive.” Kueng reaches out with a free hand to pull a pebble from the police SUV’s tire tread and toss it to the street.Lane did not sound particularly worried the first time he asked Chauvin whether they should roll Floyd on his side and suggested that Floyd might be in delirium. People in the crowd can be heard expressing fear for Floyd’s condition, asking whether he had a pulse and was breathing.A couple of minutes later, Lane sounds a bit more concerned when he asks again about rolling Floyd onto his side. The officers go quiet but show no apparent urgency as Kueng checks for a pulse and says he cannot find one.Lane’s camera shows him following an unresponsive Floyd on a stretcher into an ambulance, where EMTs instructed him to perform CPR. The video shows Lane performing constant chest compressions by hand with no visible results.The ambulance parks a few blocks away from the store for several minutes while Lane and the EMTs work on Floyd, rather than heading straight to the hospital, even though they all know that Floyd is in full cardiac arrest, as indicated by dispatcher audio.Christine Hill, a spokeswoman for Hennepin County Medical Center, the hospital that provided the ambulance, said she could not talk specifically about Floyd’s treatment because of medical privacy restrictions. But she said it is not unusual for paramedics to load a patient into an ambulance and move to a more secure location as they provide life-saving care.A coalition of news organisations and attorneys for Lane and Kueng have said the court should allow the body-camera footage to be copied and published to provide a more complete picture of what happened when Floyd was taken into custody.The viewing of the video took place on the same day Floyd family attorney Ben Crump announced a lawsuit against the city and the police officers involved in Floyd’s death.The body camera videos and transcripts were filed in court last week by Lane’s attorney, Earl Gray, as part of a request to have Lane’s case dismissed. Gray said at the time that he wanted the videos to be made public, telling the Star Tribune that they would show the “whole picture”. Gray said the bystander video shows just the last piece of what happened and “is not fair”.Gray’s request highlighted portions of the body camera video that show Floyd “actively resisting and acting erratic” with officers. It also noted Floyd’s “request” to be put on the ground. Gray also argued that Lane did not have a clear view of what Chauvin was doing.Kueng’s attorney, Tom Plunkett, has also asked that the video be made public.",
    "Lawsuit says Trump and officials ‘unlawfully conspired to violate’ demonstrators’ rights when clearing Lafayette Park.South Africa’s governing party said it is launching a “Black Friday” campaign in response to the “heinous murder” of George Floyd and “institutionalised racism” in the United States.Twitter has removed President Donald Trump’s campaign tribute video to George Floyd on its platform, citing a copyright complaint.Rights group the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has sued the Trump administration, claiming officials violated the civil rights of protesters.Mayor of Washington, DC, called for the withdrawal from the city of military units sent from other states to deal with protesters.Los Angeles County Sheriff’s office has said it will no longer enforce a curfew put in place to quell protests.Latest updates:This blog has been closed out for the day. Please go here for the latest on the protests against police brutality in the US. Minnesota’s county attorneys want to give the state attorney general the authority to handle all cases of police-involved deaths.The Minnesota County Attorneys Association voted Thursday in transferring that power during an emergency meeting, which included Attorney General Keith Ellison.Ellison is leading the state’s case against the four police officers involved in George Floyd’s death instead of the Hennepin County Attorney’s Office.State lawmakers would need to pass legislation during this month’s special session to give the attorney general the ongoing authority.“If this is the path the Legislature and governor choose to take, my office will accept the responsibility,” Ellison said. “But it must come with resources sufficient to do the job thoroughly and to do justice in the way Minnesotans have a right to expect.”Activists and politicians called on Trump to idenfifiy which law enforcement agencies were deployed across DC in response to protests against police brutality. Law enforcement facing down demonstrators were seen without identification, including badges or names, across the protests. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi wrote a letter on Thursday asking Trump to clarify which agencies were present at the protests. “I am writing to request a full list of the agencies involved and clarifications of the roles and responsibilities of the troops and federal law enforcement resources operating in the city. Congress and the American people need to know who is in charge, what is the chain of command, what is the mission, and by what authority is the National Guard from other states operating in the capital,” she wrote.Britain’s embassy in Washington, DC has raised the issue of continuing protests in the US with the Trump administration, including the treatment of British journalists by police, a spokesman for Prime Minister Boris Johnson said.“Our embassy in the US has raised the issue of the protests with the US administration – including on behalf of British journalists who were subject to police action,” the spokesman told reporters.South Africa’s governing party said it is launching a “Black Friday” campaign in response to the “heinous murder” of George Floyd and “institutionalised racism” in the US, at home, in China and “wherever it rears its ugly head”. A statement by the African National Congress said President Cyril Ramaphosa on Friday evening will address the launch of the campaign that calls on people to wear black on Fridays in solidarity. The campaign is also meant to highlight “deaths by citizens at the hands of security forces” in South Africa, which remains one of the world’s most unequal countries a quarter-century after the end of the racist system of apartheid. “The demon of racism remains a blight on the soul of our nation,” the ANC statement said.Patrick Mahomes, Saquon Barkley and Michael Thomas are among more than a dozen National Football League stars who united to send a passionate video message to the NFL about racial inequality.The 70-second video was released on social media platforms on Thursday night and includes Odell Beckham Jr, Deshaun Watson, Ezekiel Elliott, Jamal Adams, Stephon Gilmore and DeAndre Hopkins, among others. Thomas, the New Orleans Saints wide receiver who has led the league in receptions the past two seasons, opens the video with the statement: “It’s been 10 days since George Floyd was brutally murdered.” The players then take turns asking, “What if I was George Floyd?”The players then name several of the Black men and women who have recently been killed, including Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery and Eric Garner. #StrongerTogether pic.twitter.com/sfwF9Uvgaa— Patrick Mahomes II (@PatrickMahomes) June 5, 2020Australia’s most populous state, New South Wales, has lodged a legal application to stop a Black Lives Matter protest in Sydney, state Premier Gladys Berejiklian said on Friday.Thousands of people have pledged to attend a protest organised in Sydney on Saturday following the police killing of George Floyd, an unarmed Black man.The organisers had secured permission for the protest as they originally planned to have fewer than 500 people. But Berejiklian said when it became clear that thousands planned to attend, the legal application was made to the state’s Supreme Court.Twitter has disabled President Trump’s campaign tribute video to Floyd on its platform, citing a copyright complaint.The clip, which is a collation of photos and videos of protest marches and instances of violence in the aftermath of Floyd’s death, has Trump speaking in the background.“We respond to valid copyright complaints sent to us by a copyright owner or their authorised representatives,” a Twitter representative said.The 03:45-minute video uploaded on Trump’s YouTube channel was tweeted by his campaign on June 3.The clip, which is still on YouTube, had garnered more than 60,000 views and 13,000 likes. Dozens of protesters gathered in the South Korean capital of Seoul to condemn police brutality in the US and demand justice for Floyd’s death.  Announcing a joint statement in front of the downtown US Embassy, members of human rights groups and other participants also called for South Korea’s government to make a statement against the “racial discrimination and state violence” of its ally.  They said South Korea should also address its own problems with racial discrimination and urged the government to push for an anti-discrimination law, which had been resisted by conservatives and church groups for years, to improve the lives of migrant workers, undocumented foreigners and other minorities.“As the US civil society empowered and stood in solidarity with Korean pro-democracy activists in the past, we will now stand in solidarity with citizens in the United States,” said activist Lee Sang-hyun, referring to South Koreans’ bloody struggles against military dictatorships that ruled the country until the late 1980s.“In remembering George Floyd, we also wish to eliminate discrimination in South Korea’s society,” Lee said, reading out a statement.  Scott Morrison, the prime minister of Australia, urged people not to attend Black Lives Matter protests that are expected to take place in major cities this weekend citing concern over the possible spread of the coronavirus at the gatherings. Organisers expect thousands of people to attend rallies in Sydney, Melbourne and other cities that aim to focus attention on Australia’s poor record on police treatment of Indigenous people. The protests have split opinion, with some state police and legislators approving the action despite the health risks. Morrison said people should find other ways to express their anger.“The health advice is very clear, it’s not a good idea to go,” Morrison told reporters in Canberra. “Let’s find a better way and another way to express these sentiments … let’s exercise our liberties responsibly.”Read more here. A man seen on video charging protesters in New York while wearing a glove with four long, serrated-edged blades surrendered to authorities, the Queens district attorney said.People were peacefully gathering on the overpass above the Cross Island Parkway when Frank Cavalluzzi, 54, jumped out of a vehicle on Tuesday afternoon, shouting “I will kill you,” and chasing protesters while wearing the knife-claw glove, a press release from the office of District Attorney Melinda Katz said.He then got back into his vehicle and drove on a pavement, nearly running over the demonstrators, the release said.Cavalluzzi turned himself in on Thursday morning and was arraigned on charges of second-degree attempted murder, multiple degrees of attempted assault, reckless endangerment and other offences.“In a burst of anger and rage, this defendant allegedly sought to kill protesters who were peacefully assembled and exercising their right to free speech,” Katz said, adding that it was “amazing” no one was injured.Buffalo Police Commissioner Byron Lockwood has ordered the immediate suspension of the two officers involved in a video showing them pushing a man after a protest in Niagara Square. Local media reported that the man in the video was taken to the hospital. Warning: Graphic videoGRAPHIC: Buffalo police shove a peaceful elderly man to the ground, he hits his head, goes unconscious and starts bleeding out.

George Floyd’s has a number: 8:46.Eight minutes, 46 seconds – that’s the length of time prosecutors say Floyd was pinned to the ground under a white Minneapolis police officer’s knee before he died last week.In the days since, outraged protesters, politicians and mourners have seized on the detail as a quiet way to honour Floyd. Even as prosecutors have said little about how they arrived at the precise number, it has fast grown into a potent symbol of the suffering Floyd – and many other Black men – have experienced at the hands of police.Demonstrators this week laid down on streets staging “die-ins” for precisely eight minutes, 46 seconds.In Washington, Democratic senators gathered in the US Capitol’s Emancipation Hall, some standing, some kneeling on the marbled floor for the nearly nine minutes of silence.Mourners at a memorial service for Floyd in Minneapolis stood in silence for eight minutes and 46 seconds, as they were asked by the Reverend Al Sharpton to “think about what George was going through, laying there for those eight minutes, begging for his life”.Read more here. Starting Thursday night, the buildings of downtown Detroit, Michigan, will be lit purple in honour of George Floyd and all those whose lives were tragically cut short by injustice, violence and police brutality, the city’s municipality announced in a press release.The effort will go through June 9, the day of Floyd’s funeral in Houston. Detroiters will also hold a silent vigil in front of their homes on Sunday night. “The idea to light the city and host a citywide vigil came to me in recognition of the deep pain and brokenness we are all feeling, especially our black community, in light of George Floyd’s murder,” councilmember Raquel Castaneda Lopez said. “Too many black and brown lives have been lost to violence and police brutality, perpetuating the trauma these communities have experienced for generations,” she said.Anger built in Mexico over its own police brutality case: a young man allegedly beaten to death after officers detained him for not wearing a face mask during the coronavirus pandemic.The #GeorgeFloyd protests have inspired people in Mexico to call out murders at the hands of the police.

Hours later, Lopez was taken from his cell for medical treatment and died. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) sued the administration of US President Donald Trump, alleging that officials violated the civil rights of protesters who were forcefully removed from a park near the White House by police using chemical agents before Trump walked to a nearby church to take a photo.The lawsuit, filed in federal court, comes as Attorney General William Barr defended the decision to forcefully remove the peaceful protesters, saying it was necessary to protect officers and federal property.The suit argues that Trump, Barr and other officials “unlawfully conspired to violate” the protesters’ rights when clearing Lafayette Park on Monday. Law enforcement officers aggressively forced the protesters back, firing smoke bombs and pepper balls into the crowd to disperse them from the park.The lawsuit was filed on behalf of the group Black Lives Matter DC and individual protesters who were present. It is filed by the ACLU of DC, Washington Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights and Urban Affairs, Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law and the law firm of Arnold & Porter.A US man captured on video aiming a bow and arrow at protesters in Salt Lake City, Utah over the weekend was charged with assault and weapon possession.Brandon McCormick was charged with possession of a dangerous weapon by a restricted person, as well as aggravated assault and threatening or using a dangerous weapon in a fight or quarrel.He was reportedly pushed to the ground on Saturday after pointing the bow and arrow at people protesting the death of George Floyd at the hands of police. People then flipped over his car and set it on fire.Tennessee National Guard troops face a “tremendous challenge” as they head to the nation’s capital at the request of President Donald Trump to help quell protests, Governor Bill Lee told troops.“You’ve been called upon to protect the rights, the freedoms, and the privileges that Americans have to peacefully protest – to exercise their First Amendment rights in a way that they feel safe, and therefore, they can be heard,” Lee said before the 278th Armored Cavalry Regiment boarded a C-17 military transport plane headed to Washington, DC.“But you’ve also been called up to protect the lives and the property … against those who hijack peaceful protests and turn them into violent riots. Balancing that protection is a tremendous challenge,” the Republican continued.Tennessee is one of several states to send National Guard troops to Washington. Roughly 1,000 Tennessee troops are expected to be in Washington no later than Saturday. However, at least three states with Democratic governors – New York, Virginia and Delaware – have so far rejected the request.The Trump administration asked multiple states to send troops to Washington at the same time as the president recently criticised many governors as “weak” for not using the National Guard more aggressively in their own states.Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers defended his decision to deploy the Wisconsin National Guard to help police control protests over George Floyd’s death.Evers told reporters during a conference call that he deployed the Guard to protect property in Madison, including the state Capitol building, and utilities in Milwaukee. If the troops actively intervened, they did so at the direction of local authorities, he said.Evers said Thursday the protests are a watershed opportunity to fix systemic racism. He encouraged people to demonstrate lawfully.“First Amendment rights are not to be trampled in this state or any other state,” Evers said. “Those who decide to do damage are damaging the First Amendment and they’re damaging the opportunity for thousands of people across Wisconsin to exercise that First Amendment right.”In Minneapolis, Minnesota, where George Floyd died, Reverand Al Sharpton cut into a session of religious music to start an eight-minute silence to honour Floyd, who was held down by Chauvin’s knee for eight minutes and 46 seconds. Sharpton called actress Tiffany Haddish and Gwen Carr, Eric Garner’s mother, to stand next to him during the silence. Garner died in 2014 after a police officer put him in a chokehold. In his last moments, he could be heard saying: “I can’t breathe.”Haddish was joined in attendance by other celebrities including actors, musicians, activists and politicians. Kevin Hart, Ludacris, TI, Tyrese Gibson, Master P, Reverend Jesse Jackson and Minnesota senator Amy Klobuchar were all at the memorial service.Read more here.Reverend Al Sharpton gave the eulogy at Floyd’s memorial in Minneapolis. He said it wasn’t a “normal” funeral and Floyd didn’t die of natural causes.“He died of a common American criminal justice malfunction”, Sharpton said. “There has not been the corrective behaviour that has taught this country that if you commit a crime, it does not matter whether you wear blue jeans or a blue uniform, you must pay for the crime you had committed.”, he continued.Sharpton said he eulogised Eric Garner, another Black man who was killed by police officers and whose final words were “I can’t breathe”.  What happened to men like Floyd and Garner “happens every day” in the US, through institutional racism, Sharpton said. “We were smarter than the underfunded schools you put us in, but you had your knee on our neck. We had creative skills, we could do whatever anybody else could do, but we couldn’t get your knee off our neck.” Calling for change, Sharpton said it’s “time to stand up in George’s name … and say get your knee off our necks”.Benjamin Crump, the lawyer for Floyd’s family, started his address to the Minneapolis memorial service with a quote from Dr Martin Luther King Jr: “He who passively accepts evil is as much involved in it as he who helps to perpetrate it. He who accepts evil without protesting against it is really cooperating with it.”Crump, who yesterday celebrated the elevation of charges against former police officer Derek Chauvin, who knelt on Floyd’s neck – along with charges for the three other cops involved – said that what people saw in the video of Floyd’s death was “torture”.  Crump called on people to protest the injustice committed against Floyd and against other members of the African-American community. “We cannot cooperate with evil,” he said. “We cannot cooperate with injustice. We cannot cooperate with torture. Because George Floyd deserved better than that.”Philonise Floyd, George’s brother, told mourners at his memorial that George was like “a general” and that people wanted to follow him. Philonise described his brother as a man who made people feel “like the president”. He said people “wanted to greet him” and “wanted to have fun with him.”Philonise ended his remarks by saying “everybody want justice, we want justice for George. He’s going to get it.”Hundreds are expected to attend on Thursday the first of several planned memorials for George Floyd, an unarmed Black man killed by police in Minneapolis, Minnesota last month.The Minneapolis event will kick off a week of services to honour Floyd, whose death on May 25, captured on video, set off protests across the United States, and worldwide.Read more. The mayor of Washington, DC, on Thursday called for the withdrawal from the US capital of military units sent from other states to deal with protests against police brutality and racism.“We want troops from out of state out of Washington DC,” Mayor Muriel Bowser told a news conference. Protesters – particularly in cities that have struggled to control the novel coronavirus – should “highly consider” getting tested for COVID-19, the illness caused by the virus, a top US health official said on Thursday.“Those individuals that have partaken in these peaceful protests or have been out protesting, and particularly if they’re in metropolitan areas that really haven’t controlled the outbreak … we really want those individuals to highly consider being evaluated and get tested,” Robert Redfield, director for the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told a US House of Representatives committee.Redfield also said the World Health Organization (WHO) continues to be a close colleague in public health efforts. US President Donald Trump said on Friday that the US will end its relationship with the WHO over the body’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic.US Senator Lisa Murkowski, a Republican, said on Thursday that she is struggling over whether she can support President Donald Trump’s re-election bid, saying criticism of Trump’s response to nationwide protests by former Defense Secretary James Mattis rang true.Asked if she supported Trump, a fellow Republican who faces the nation’s voters again in November, she said, “I am struggling with it. I have struggled with it for a long time.”“He is our duly elected president. I will continue to work with him … but I think right now as we are all struggling to find ways to express the words that need to be expressed appropriately,” Murkowski added.The Los Angeles County Sheriff’s office said on Twitter that it will no longer enforce a curfew put in place to quell protests. “Based upon current situational awareness and the recent pattern of peaceful actions by protesters, the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department (@LASDHQ) will no longer enforce a curfew,” Sheriff Alex Villanueva tweeted. “Other jurisdictions are free to make their own decisions.”Other jurisdictions are free to make their own decisions.____________________________________________________________________Hello and welcome to Al Jazeera’s continuing coverage of the protests in the US over the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, Minnesota. This is Laurin-Whitney Gottbrath in Louisville, Kentucky, Creede Newton in Washington, DC, and Lucien Formichella in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Here are a few things to catch up on:See the updates from Tuesday’s protests here.",
    "Fifteen jurors are chosen for the trial of former policeman Derek Chauvin charged in the killing of George Floyd.A jury has been seated in the US city of Minneapolis, Minnesota for the trial of a former police officer charged in George Floyd‘s death, with opening statements set for March 29 in a case that led to weeks of protests and soul-searching about racial justice.The final juror was chosen on Tuesday, wrapping up a process that took more than two weeks and was complicated by worldwide attention to Floyd’s death, even before the city of Minneapolis announced a $27m settlement to his family early in the process.Lawyers and the judge worked through more than 100 potential jurors, dismissing most because they acknowledged strong views about an encounter that was captured on bystander video.Community murals painted on the side of what was the Lake Street Kmart, which was destroyed in the wake of George Floyd’s death in Minneapolis, Minnesota, US [Leah Millis/Reuters]The panel now includes 15 jurors. Twelve will deliberate, with two alternates; Hennepin County Judge Peter Cahill has said he will excuse the extra juror when opening statements begin on Monday if the 14 others still are able to serve.Derek Chauvin is charged with second- and third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter in the May 25 death of Floyd. The Black man was declared dead after Chauvin, who is white, pressed his knee against his neck for about nine minutes while Floyd was handcuffed and pleading that he could not breathe.The widely seen video set off street protests in Minneapolis, some violent, that spread across the US and the world.The final juror chosen is a married accountant who said he initially formed a somewhat negative opinion of Chauvin, saying it seemed like the length of his restraint on Floyd was longer than necessary. But he said he would be able to put that aside and weigh the case based on the evidence.He said Floyd’s death sparked discussions about racism at work, and he decided to educate himself by reading a book about the subject. He said he has a healthy respect for police and views Black Lives Matter somewhat favourably. However, he said some of the frustrations boiled over and may have been a factor in violent unrest in Minneapolis.Defence lawyer Eric Nelson, left, and defendant former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin listening while Hennepin County Judge Peter Cahill presides over pre-trial motions, prior to continuing jury selection in Minneapolis, Minnesota [Court TV/Pool via AP]Several other potential jurors were dismissed earlier in the day, including a former truck driver who called a movement to defund the police “lunacy” and said he would likely believe police officers over citizens. Others dismissed included a woman who said she feared for her safety if chosen for the panel and a man who said he could not be impartial.The defence frequently struck people who told the court they already had strong feelings about Chauvin’s guilt. The prosecution frequently used its allotted challenges against potential jurors who were not just supportive of police but said they would favour their testimony over others. They also sought to block potential jurors who were critical or doubtful about the Black Lives Matter movement.With the jury seated, both sides now gear up for opening statements on Monday. Legal experts have said the bystander video – already seen by almost everyone on the jury – is compelling footage but that a conviction is not a slam-dunk for prosecutors.Of the first 14 jurors seated, eight are white, four are Black and two are multiracial, according to the court. Nine are women and five are men, and they range in age from their 20s to 60s. The race and age of the 15th juror were not immediately released by the court.Cahill on Friday had dismissed a defence request to delay or move the trial because the $27m civil settlement for Floyd’s family came on March 12, just as jury selection was getting under way.“Unfortunately, I think the pretrial publicity in this case will continue no matter how long we continue it. Perhaps some of it may, with time, be forgotten by people,” Cahill said.“And as far as change of venue, I do not think that that would give the defendant any kind of a fair trial beyond what we are doing here today.”",
    "The Black Lives Matter struggle is no longer confined to the national borders of the United States.Wherever we live in the world, we, Black Americans, cannot escape the feeling of collective grief that has overwhelmed our community after George Floyd, a Black man, was murdered by a white police officer in Minneapolis.  Watching the widely circulated video showing the last moments of Floyd’s life, I felt the devastating pain and anger at the never-ending injustice that Black Americans face in their own country. It was not so long ago that we marched in New York over the brutal death of Eric Garner at the hands of the police – another Black man who died pleading “I can’t breathe!” It was not long ago that protests were held for other Black victims of white supremacy – all clearly ignored by the system which supports and protects Black oppression.Sitting in my small apartment in Berlin, I also felt the survivor’s guilt – the guilt of knowing that I have escaped the gruesome reality of Black life in America, which was once again laid bare by the recent cascade of Black death – from the killing of Floyd to the killings of Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, Tony McDade, Rayshard Brooks and many others whose stories have not made it to mainstream media. And then the streets of America erupted. Hundreds of thousands braved a pandemic and sadistic police brutality to declare that Black lives matter and enough is enough. Hundreds of thousands persisted in their protest, as the US president threatened “where there is looting, there is shooting” and officials called for the army to be deployed and martial law. They resisted, as the media tried to distort their demonstrations and politicians and pundits conspired to shift the conversation towards piecemeal reforms. Despite the repression, slander and obfuscation, the new iteration of the Black Lives Matter protests led by Black women, men and transgender and other queer people, persevered and stayed on course. It was inspiring to watch from afar their political acuity and tenacity and their insistence on revolution, not reform.It was breath-taking to see their spectacular success at putting prison abolition and defunding the police on the current political agenda and drawing attention to divestment from oppressive policing to investment in communities to address housing precarity, economic inequality and health disparities. It was galvanising to see issues of marginalisation within the Black community raised. Some 15,000 people marched in Brooklyn for the visibility of Black transgender lives and an end to violence against Black transgender people, declaring “We [transgender people] are not going to be left out.”My pain was mixed with elation and pride watching people articulate versions of freedom that I have believed in for years – a Black freedom struggle that does not leave anyone behind and that is grounded on full equality through revolutionary change, not symbolic reform. Indeed, I so wished I was in the United States to take part in this historic moment, in this revolutionary movement. But return home for me is not an option. I am in debt exile – a consequence of the same economic oppression that leaves so many Black Americans destitute. Apart from a student loan of $120,000, what keeps me away from the US is also the trauma of Black life. My family, too, has been affected by the American carceral state which preys on Black people. In 2014, my brother – who suffers from schizophrenia – was incarcerated for more than eight months for trespassing on someone’s lawn and in 2019, he was shot and survived a gun wound. Some of my cousins are currently imprisoned in the state of Florida, awaiting their release, while being in solitary confinement to avoid contracting COVID-19. Similar to James Baldwin, who fled suffocating racism and spent some pivotal years living in Europe during the civil rights movement, I feel guilty about living abroad during this moment where I am afforded the space to write, breathe, and be debt-free.But unlike Baldwin, I cannot return. After three years of setting up a home in Berlin, building a community with local activists and artists, and finding stability for the first time in my life, a return to the US would be a reckoning with the full gravity of being Black in America – it would be a return to the indebted and worried existence of physical and economic survival, and that is something I can no longer bear.But, we, Black American emigres, did not watch idle the revolutionary momentum that the George Floyd protests triggered.  The anger, pain and despair that poured out in the streets of America were so powerful that they shook the whole world, inspiring solidarity protests in dozens of countries, which gave more ammunition to challenge police state violence and the legacies of colonialism. And we joined. In France, Black Parisians reignited the struggle for justice for Adama Traore, a 24-year old Black Parisian who died in police custody. In England, protesters attacked the statue of historic figures who played a leading role in British imperialism and the slave trade, starting a nationwide conversation about the whitewashing of British colonial history. In Belgium, after mass protests forced the removal of several statues of King Leopold II, notorious for his barbaric rule of Congo; they also prompted the head of parliament to call for a truth and reconciliation commission to address colonial time crimes.In the Netherlands, demonstrations elicited calls for the use of blackface to portray “Black Pete” in Christmas celebrations to be banned.In Brazil, the last country in the Americas to officially abolish slavery, there have also been protests in support of Black Lives Matter. The country itself is still struggling with the anti-Black racist legacy of its colonial period and the brutal US-backed dictatorship during the Cold War period. There, too, Black people are the main victim of police brutality and systemic discrimination. In Australia, protests have pushed to the fore public discussions about white settler colonialism and state violence against the Aboriginal people, which the white majority has long sought to suppress. In fact, the local authorities sought to ban protests in cities like Sidney, using the COVID-19 pandemic as an excuse. In Germany, local protests which were held not just in Berlin, but in other large cities across the country, also sparked national conversations about racism. Many people, including white Americans I know, insist that racism is not as bad in Germany as it is in the US. But official statistics, as well as testimonies of brown and Black people, tell a different story. These protests offered a much-needed space for me and other Black Americans to voice our pain publicly. I spent three weekends protesting with hundreds of people outside Brandenburg Gate, tens of thousands at Alexanderplatz, and several thousand in Hermannplatz, chanting, grieving, and decrying the ongoing assault on Black life in America and around the world. Indeed, deep-rooted, debilitating, structural racism is an international problem. It is a transatlantic creation, forged and maintained by white people in both Europe and the Americas and it is heavily interlinked. White supremacy and neo-colonialism do not stop at national borders but rather form transnational systems of oppression that subjugate, exploit, and brutalise for the benefit of the white elite at the top.I, as a Black Haitian-American, have experienced racism both at home and abroad and I see these experiences in a continuum. And I have come to believe that the anti-racism struggle may take different forms in different places, but if we want honest and concrete ways to address the violent histories that we have inherited, then we have to engage in the fight against racism globally. The renewed momentum of the Black Lives Matter movement sparked by the death of George Floyd has opened up spaces for this kind of global struggle against racialised violence, oppression and neocolonialism. And people like me, guilty survivors of racist oppression in the US, are able to find renewed meaning in our struggles. “Once you find yourself in another civilisation,” Baldwin noted, “you’re forced to examine your own.” And it is from this distance, as a writer and an activist that I am honing in and participating in anti-racism activism here in Europe, the birthplace of white supremacy and colonialism.As a descendant of Africans who were enslaved and forcibly transported to the Americas, I am challenging racism on the very continent from where the enslavement and subjugation of my ancestors were organised, directed and justified. This gives me space and perspective to grapple with this complex centuries-old system of oppression from its roots all the way to its many modern-day manifestations both locally and internationally.

    "Minneapolis braces for fifth night of protests as activists demand charges for all four cops involved in Floyd’s death.Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA – The governor of Minnesota, where protests have erupted over police brutality and the death of George Floyd during the last week, has fully mobilised the National Guard to Minneapolis for the first time in state history.Governor Tim Walz said the deployment comes as part of an effort to help quell the protests, which have often started off peaceful before descending into chaos, with fires and looting – violence he largely blamed on outsiders.“We do not have the numbers,” Walz said. “We cannot arrest people when we are trying to hold ground.”Minnesota National Guard General Jon Jensen said all the state’s guardsmen had been activated, and some 2,500 members were expected to be mobilised by midday. “It means we’re all in,” Jensen said.It is the “largest domestic deployment in the Minnesota’s National Guard’s 164-year history,” the National Guard said on Twitter.The deployment comes more than four days after the killing of George Floyd, which has set off angry protests across the United States against police brutality and the treatment of African Americans. Friday saw demonstrations and marches, sometimes violent, in Minneapolis, Louisville, Kentucky, Atlanta, Georgia, Houston, Texas, Washington, DC, and elsewhere.Floyd died on Monday after Derek Chauvin, a white officer, pinned the Black man’s neck down to the ground with his knee for nearly nine minutes.A bystander video of the incident shows Floyd pleading for help, repeatedly saying: “I can’t breathe.”  Floyd eventually goes motionless, and Chauvin continues to kneel on Floyd’s neck for nearly three minutes despite appeals by bystanders to get off of him, according to court documents.The four officers involved, including Chauvin, were fired on Tuesday. Chauvin was arrested and charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter on Friday, more than three delays after the incident.Governor Walz said he expected Saturday’s protests in Minneapolis to be the most intense yet. Protesters have previously told Al Jazeera they plan to stay in the streets until at least all four officers have been arrested and charged, despite nightly curfews and the presence of the National Guard.“They would not need the [National Guard] if they would just listen to the people,” said Aman Mohamed, another Minneapolis resident.It’s uncertain what exactly it’s going to take for things to calm down, but Layla Ahmed, another resident, told Al Jazeera “having one person arrested is not enough. We need all four.”In a joint statement with the family of Floyd, Benjamin Crump, a prominent civil rights lawyer whose firm is representing their case, called the arrest of Chauvin “a welcome but overdue step on the road to justice”.Crump and the family also expressed disappointment with the charge itself. “We expected a first-degree murder charge,” they said. “We want a first-degree murder charge. And we want to see the other officers arrested.”The fact that the three other officers, identified as Thomas Lane, Tou Thao, and J Alexander Kueng, stood by while Chauvin pinned Floyd with his knee for almost nine minutes “demonstrates a breakdown in training and policy by the city” the statement said. “We fully expect to see the other officers who did nothing to protect the life of George Floyd to be arrested and charged soon.”Over 6 MILLION of you have signed this petition (started by a 15 year old, btw) to urge @MayorFrey & DA Mike Freeman to ARREST & CHARGE ALL FOUR officers involved in the murder of George Floyd. Join the fight as we get #JusticeForGeorgeFloyd!! Petition: https://t.co/hrm4TXXCHA pic.twitter.com/NvjrmgLkm6— Ben Crump (@AttorneyCrump) May 30, 2020The bail for Chauvin has been set at $500,000, according to an official document provided by CNN. If convicted, he could face up to 25 years in prison.In addition to more arrests, Crump and the family said it is essential that Minneapolis “closely examines and changes its policing policies and training procedures to correct for their lack of proper field supervision; the use of appropriate, non-lethal restraint techniques; the ability to recognise medical signs associated with the restriction of airflow, and the legal duty to seek emergency medical care and stop a civil rights violation.”Crump also said the family had hired an independent medical examiner to conduct their own autopsy, following the release by the preliminary autopsy report by the Hennepin County Medical Examiner’s office.The report said there were “no physical findings that support a diagnosis of traumatic asphyxia or strangulation”.Floyd likely died from “the combined effects of … being restrained by police, his underlying health conditions and any potential intoxicants in his system,” the report added.Responding to the report, Floyd’s family said: “We are not surprised, yet we are tragically disappointed in the preliminary autopsy findings released today by the medical examiner. We hope that this does not reflect efforts to create a false narrative for the reason George Floyd died.”Meanwhile, in south Minneapolis on Saturday morning, community members cleaned up from the previous night’s protests as National Guardsmen continued to arrive in the city.“It doesn’t seem like [the National Guard] contained much,” said Stefanie Rangel, 27, who helped organise the clean-up crew that has been picking up “lots and lots” of broken glass in the hopes that children can walk around safely.It's not hyperbolic to say that every business has been effected, but many locally owned ones were spared in comparison to the major corporate outlets. pic.twitter.com/Mi9uFrvvCo— Lucien (@lucien_form) May 30, 2020Wahab T, a resident of 25 years, who said he knows half of the small business owners in the area from living just a few blocks away, is ambivalent about the National Guard’s involvement. “They’re here to help,” he said. The bad part, he thinks, is that kids have to see guardsmen walking around with guns. “They think this is a warzone.”Another longtime resident, Marvin Smith, who describes himself as a peaceful bystander that was at the Plymouth protests of 1966 in North Minneapolis, said the Guard “should have been here”, but that “you can’t tell people not to protest 400 years of injustice.”Smith said he “hopes it’s peaceful forever,” that it was unfair to compare brick and mortar buildings to “blood, sweat, and tears”. He said he believed there is still a long way to go before people of colour have the same opportunities and freedoms as white people. “The idea that this is going to go away when the rioting stops is asinine.”In addition to the National Guard, the Pentagon on Saturday ordered the Army to put military police units on alert in case they are requested in the city, The Associated Press news agency reported.US President Donald Trump, who reportedly requested the rare move by the Pentagon, has – without providing evidence – blamed the violence on “radical left” protesters.But Minnesota Governor Walz said on Saturday authorities believe some of the violence in Minneapolis is the work of a “tightly controlled” group of outsiders, including white supremacist groups and drug cartels. He did not elaborate.Layal Ahmed, a resident, also had her suspicions.“I believe these fires are not being started by the youth,” she said,“I believe it’s being started by people coming from the suburbs, or even white supremacists,” she added. “People that live here love this city, but we don’t stand for injustice.”",
    "Tou Thao, one of four officers charged for the death, says he was a ‘human traffic cone’ focused on crowd control.A former Minneapolis police officer involved in George Floyd’s arrest has told investigators he was focused on crowd control and minimised his role in the actions that led to Floyd’s death, video of the interview shows.Tou Thao, one of the four former officers charged in Floyd’s death, described himself as a “human traffic cone” as he held back onlookers who became increasingly horrified at the police officers’ actions during the May 25 incident, the Star Tribune reported on Saturday, citing video that was released a day before.Floyd, a handcuffed Black man, died after a white officer, Derek Chauvin, pressed his knee against his neck for nearly nine minutes on May 25 as Floyd repeatedly said he could not breathe and as bystanders pleaded with officers to help him.“I don’t want anyone to die,” Thao told an investigator who asked what his reaction was to Floyd’s death. “It was kind of a sombre moment, especially for me. My heart kind of sank.”Thao voluntarily participated in the one-hour, 40-minute interview with the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension eight days after Floyd’s death. He said as the bystanders got louder, he became worried they might rush Chauvin and two other officers who were holding Floyd on the ground.Floyd’s death has prompted a national reckoning over racial injustice and police atrocities that has seen months of protests across the United States.Thao and Chauvin had gone to the scene to help two officers, Thomas Lane and J Alexander Kueng, who were attempting to arrest Floyd for allegedly passing a counterfeit $20 bill at a convenience store.While they were on the way, Thao said dispatch cancelled the backup call. But Thao, who was driving, said he felt compelled to respond because Lane and Kueng were new officers and the intersection was known to be “especially hostile” to police.In the interview, Thao said Floyd appeared to be on drugs, resisted arrest and used his legs to get out of a squad car.As the officers restrained Floyd on the ground, Thao said he heard him say he could not breathe, adding, “but then he was obviously yelling and talking”.Thao also said he has never used the manoeuvre that Chauvin used to pin Floyd to the ground.Although a woman who identified herself as a Minneapolis firefighter approached Thao and demanded that officers check Floyd’s pulse, Thao told investigators his job was securing the scene and that he could not “be in two places at once”.Thao, Lane and Kueng are charged with aiding and abetting both second-degree murder and manslaughter.Chauvin is charged with second-degree murder, third-degree murder and manslaughter. All four officers were fired and are scheduled for trial in March.The video of Thao’s interview was made available on Friday after Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison’s office filed it to support a motion to have all four officers tried jointly.The next court hearing for the four is scheduled for September 11.",
    "Prosecutors urge longer sentences for four officers charged over Floyd’s death, saying they showed ‘particular cruelty’.Minnesota state prosecutors have filed a motion to seek longer sentencing beyond the current state guidelines for the four officers involved in the death of George Floyd.The 46-year-old died after police office Derek Chauvin knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes during an incident in Minneapolis on May 25.Video recordings of Floyd telling the officers he could not breathe before going silent have sparked national and international condemnation and protests against racial injustice and police brutality.The charges against Chauvin include unintentional second-degree murder and three other officers – J Alexander Kueng, Thomas Lane and Tou Thao – have been charged with aiding and abetting second-degree murder and aiding and abetting second-degree manslaughter.  The reasons given by prosecutors to justify the longer sentencing include that Floyd was “particularly vulnerable” because he was already handcuffed and had been placed “chest down on the pavement”. They also said the fact that officers did not respond to Floyd’s pleas that he could not breathe represented “particular cruelty”, that the officers abused their authority, that they acted in a group, and that they “committed the crime in the presence of multiple children”. In a separate court filing, lawyers for Chauvin called for the second-degree murder charges against the former police officer to be dismissed.In the documents filed on Friday, Chauvin’s lawyers argued there was not enough evidence to prove the officer intended to kill Floyd.In the court filings, the defence lawyers also charged that Floyd died from an overdose of fentanyl combined with other drugs and pre-existing health conditions, not from Chauvin’s actions, while adding that Chauvin was following police training during the death.“What Mr Chauvin saw was a strong man struggling mightily with police officers, which seemed contradictory to Mr Floyd’s claims about not being able to breathe,” said the filing.“Mr Chauvin could not have known about Mr Floyd’s underlying issues when he arrived on the scene,” said the filing, which cited a June autopsy report conducted by the Hennepin County Medical Examiner and a conversation between the medical examiner and the prosecutors in support of the claim. In a statement for the Wall Street Journal, Ben Crump, a lawyer representing the Floyd family, called the request for dismissal a “desperate attempt with charlatan tactics” and cited the results of an independent autopsy requested by the family that showed the cause of death to be “asphyxia from the compression of his neck and back”.Chauvin’s lawyers also argued that a fair trial could not be held in the Twin Cities Metropolitan Area, which includes Minneapolis and Saint Paul, as the “jury pools have surely been tainted” by local and international coverage of the protests, “riots and lootings” in the area following Floyd’s death.",
    "Philonise ‘tired of seeing Black men die’ as protests continue across the US over deadly arrest of unarmed Black man.Philonise Floyd, the brother of George Floyd, a Black man who died earlier this week after a white police officer pinned him down with his knee for several minutes, said he just wants justice for his brother.A video of Monday’s incident shows George, who was unarmed, pleading with Minneapolis police officers, saying “I can’t breathe” while pinned to the ground, before becoming unresponsive with the officer’s knee still on his neck.He was pronounced dead at a local hospital later on Monday.Protests have since erupted across the United States as anger over his death intensified, with some demonstrators gaining access to a police precinct in Minneapolis, Minnesota and setting sections of the building on fire.On Thursday, Philonise said the protesters “have the same pain that I feel”.“I want everybody to be peaceful right now but people are torn and hurt because they’re tired of seeing black men die constantly, over and over again,” Philonise told CNN.“I understand and I see why a lot of people are doing a lot of different things around the world. I don’t want them to lash out like that, but I can’t stop people right now. Because they have pain. They have the same pain that I feel. I want everything to be peaceful, but I can’t make everybody be peaceful. I can’t. It’s hard.”The four officers involved in Monday’s incident were swiftly fired, but Floyd’s family, community leaders and residents are calling for arrests to be made.Hundreds of protesters marched in downtown Minneapolis for a third night on Thursday, demanding justice and an end to police violence.“Say his name. George Floyd,” protesters chanted. “I can’t breathe.”While the protests have started peaceful, they have descended into chaos with reports of looting, arson and vandalism.Police have used tear gas and non-lethal projectiles to disperse the crowds, drawing anger from local residents.A large fire was seen near the third precinct of the Minneapolis Police Department (MPD) on Thursday.A police spokesman confirmed staff had evacuated the 3rd Precinct station “in the interest of the safety of our personnel”. Protesters could be seen setting fire to a Minneapolis Police Department jacket.I came back out. This is my neighborhood. You can see flames for a mile and feel the heat from a block away pic.twitter.com/0kmkBqcFZJ— Max Nesterak (@maxnesterak) May 28, 2020The City of Minneapolis urged protesters to retreat from the area over unconfirmed reports that gas lines had been cut.Protesters outside the police building could be heard yelling: “We’re sick and tired of being sick and tired.”When asked in the CNN interview what his message to the police is, Philonise said he wants them “to get everything right”.“I want them to get everything right. Start doing your job the right way because I haven’t been seeing it, years and years down the line I haven’t been seeing it at all.“I’m tired of seeing Black men die. Black lives matter too,” he said, before breaking down in tears.“I just want justice. I just want justice,” Philonise said, wiping his tears.",
    "From pop-up food pantries to clean-up crews, Minneapolis residents unite to support each other and honour George Floyd.Minneapolis, Minnesota, US – A pop-up food pantry; a tagger who covers up profanity; an abandoned hotel that takes in homeless individuals and protesters. In between the news headlines that have thrust Minneapolis, Minnesota, into the United States national spotlight is a community that has come together to honour George Floyd by helping those in need.Rows of tents flanked by piles of donated food, hygiene supplies, first-aid supplies and other goods line a field in Saint Paul, which neighbours Minneapolis, the city where Floyd was killed in late May.The pop-up food pantry was started in the wake of the police killing of Floyd. The 46-year-old Black man died on May 25 after a white police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes as Floyd repeatedly pleaded, “I can’t breathe”, before going motionless.The killing set off protests in Minneapolis and across the country, calling for justice for Floyd and an end to police brutality. As anger exploded, some of the protests turned violent, with fires, looting and vandalism. Some local businesses were hit. Others were already under strain from coronavirus lockdowns that had been in place for months.“People are hurtin because of George[‘s] situation … And if George Floyd would have had justice from the beginning our stores would be up. If politicians, and lawmakers, and the legal world would take our lives seriously, this wouldn’t happen,” said Shay Webbie, a local comedian, who started the Saint Paul pop-up food pantry.What started as one tent with two tables now covers an entire field with more than a half dozen tents and trailers. Similar initiatives can be seen across Saint Paul and Minneapolis. Hundreds of volunteers help with the Saint Paul food pantry – known on Facebook as ShayCares – and anyone in need can pick up supplies, no questions asked.“It’s like watching your baby grow up and graduate,” said Webbie with tears in her eyes as she looked out over the field.Kim Peter, 52, who moved into the neighbourhood when she was five years old, came with her sister to get supplies for their elderly mother, who is on a fixed income.She told Al Jazeera that seeing how the community has come together made her feel “amazed”, “grateful”, and “humbled”.“There’s so many words that can describe it,” she said as her sister pushed a shopping cart filled with toilet paper, eggs, butter, bread and sausage.As incredible as the support has been, Peter knows it is going to take a lot more to get the community back on its feet. “A week from now, two weeks from now when the news is gone, we still have to live amongst this,” said Peter about the damage from last week.Other residents are focused on cleaning up and rebuilding the areas hardest hit. Clean-up crews have shown up in south Minneapolis neighbourhoods nearly every day since the protests began to collect rubbish and sweep up glass.The Lake Street Council, an organisation that normally focuses on marketing Lake Street and supporting businesses, set up a donation service for businesses damaged by the protests. The fund has raised more than $4.9m as of Friday.  According to Allison Sharkey, who has spent the last six years as executive director of The Lake Street Council, the outpouring has been astounding. More than 57,000 donors have contributed. Sharkey told Al Jazeera that they did not have a goal in mind when they started the fundraiser, but “if we had, we maybe would have sought $50,000”.When distributing the funds, the council said it will ensure that the money goes to locally-owned businesses, especially those run by owners of colour.The council is asking itself: “How do we ensure that property stays in the hands of local entrepreneurs – of colour especially – rather than investors that are not from this community?” said Sharkey.Other residents have supported protesters by handing out water or offering their homes as places where protestors can charge their mobile phones or use the restroom.A former hotel was converted into a shelter for the Minneapolis homeless population, whose members had nowhere to go when the curfew began and the police started clearing the streets.“It feels good to see our community out here, but it’s horrible the circumstances in which we have gathered here today,” said Melissa Ferguson, a south Minneapolis native, on Sunday as she stood by the area where people were handing out food and supplies in south Minneapolis, at the intersection where Floyd was killed.Footage from earlier today of people unloading food for the community from a U Haul truck outside of the Cup Foods where George Floyd was killed.

On Saturday, he used a can of spray paint to cover profanity painted on the side of a brewing company. He tagged “Floyd” while a fellow artist sprayed “George” onto another door.He had started with a friend’s building and word spread to the brewery’s owner. “It turned out really good and I got a really good response from it, so I got invited out today to go walk around and try and do the same thing,” said Simon, who lives down the street. He views his work as a way to bring a more positive outlook to the situation.Webbie, who started the food pantry pop-up, hopes the work she and others have started will continue long after the protests have ended and stores have reopened.“It takes away some of the pain, but at the end of the night I still reflect on George Floyd,” said Webbie.“Here’s the thing,” she added. “A lot of us are always about good. It just takes a situation like this for it to be seen.”",
    "Department of Justice takes new action in the probe, which languished under the Trump administration.A federal US investigation into the police killing of George Floyd, an unarmed Black man, has shown signs of reinvigoration with the empanelling of a new grand jury and the calling of new witnesses, according to reports from The New York Times and Associated Press.The actions indicate a renewed emphasis on the investigation by the Justice Department under the administration of President Joe Biden after the federal probe into Floyd’s death languished under the leadership of former President Donald Trump, according to the New York Times, citing two people with direct knowledge of the investigation.The AP confirmed the report, saying several witnesses have been subpoenaed to appear before a federal grand jury considering charges against former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, who is already facing state murder charges in Floyd’s death, a person familiar with the matter said.Floyd died after  Chauvin kneeled on his neck for more than nine minutes during a stop in Minneapolis, Minnesota in May 2020. Video footage of the incident, in which Floyd can be heard pleading “I can’t breathe”, helped to prompt national racial justice protests across the country.The Justice Department’s federal civil rights investigation has been focused on Chauvin and some of the witnesses, including other officers who worked with Chauvin, according to the person, who could not publicly discuss the non-public proceedings and spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity.Chauvin was fired by the Minneapolis Police Department a day after Floyd’s death, and currently faces state charges of second-degree unintentional murder and second-degree manslaughter.Three other officers — Thomas Lane, J Kueng and Tou Thao — are charged with aiding and abetting second-degree murder and manslaughter and are scheduled to face trial in August.All four were fired soon after Floyd’s death.The federal probe focuses on whether Chauvin violated Floyd’s civil rights during the deadly encounter. It was launched just three days after Floyd’s death, but then-Attorney General William Barr later indicated the Department of Justice would hold off until after Chauvin faces criminal charges in state court. Those proceedings are set to begin on March 8.A federal grand jury empanelled last year that began to hear evidence in the case has since expired.The lawyer for Floyd’s family, Ben Crump, in a statement to the Times, said it was “appropriate and gratifying that the Department of Justice under President Biden is taking racial justice seriously”. Biden’s presidential run coincided with the high-profile death of Floyd and other unarmed Black people in the US, with racial justice becoming a pillar of his campaign.During his inaugural address, the president said: “A cry for racial justice, some 400 years in the making, moves us. The dream of justice for all will be deferred no longer.”The Justice Department under Biden is expected to focus more on civil rights issues, criminal justice overhauls and policing policies in the wake of nationwide protests over the death of Black Americans at the hands of law enforcement.At his confirmation hearing this week, Judge Merrick Garland, Biden’s nominee for attorney general, emphasised his commitment to combating racial discrimination in policing, telling the Senate Judiciary Committee that America does not “yet have equal justice.”Still, Biden has promised not to exert control over the Department of Justice, which critics say Trump sought to use for his political gain. Biden has said the department must be able to act independently as it investigates and prosecutes cases.",
    "Thousands attend anti-racism demonstrations in London and Australia as protests continue in several US cities.The UK health minister said anti-racism protests attended by thousands of people in London and other major British cities increase the risk of spreading COVID-19.Latest updates:New York City is lifting its curfew spurred by protests against police brutality before schedule, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced on Sunday morning.The 8pm citywide curfew, New York’s first in decades, had been set to remain in effect through at least Sunday, with the city planning to lift it at the same time it enters the first phase of reopening after more than two months of shutdowns because of the coronavirus.“Yesterday and last night we saw the very best of our city,” de Blasio tweeted in his announcement of the curfew’s end “effective immediately”. “Tomorrow we take the first big step to restart.”The move followed New York City police pulling back on enforcing the curfew on Saturday as thousands took to the streets and parks to protest against police brutality, sparked by the death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police.The mayor of Minneapolis ran a gauntlet of angry, jeering protesters on Saturday after telling them he was opposed to their demands for defunding the city police following George Floyd’s fatal encounter with law enforcement.Mayor Jacob Frey, a former civil rights lawyer who took office two years ago promising to repair the police department’s strained relations with minorities, was showered with angry chants of “go home, Jacob, go home” and “shame, shame”, as he stalked away through the crowd, head bowed.Popular South Korean band BTS donated $1m to Black Lives Matter (BLM) in support of US protests against police brutality, its music label, Big Hit Entertainment, told Reuters news agency.On Thursday, the seven-member BTS wrote on its Twitter account that they are against racism and violence with the hashtag #BlackLivesMatter.“We stand against racial discrimination. We condemn violence. You, I and we all have the right to be respected. We will stand together.” The hashtag went viral among the K-pop group’s fans and started another wave of donations with a new hashtag, #MatchAMillion.Fourteen police officers were injured in “shocking and completely unacceptable” assaults during anti-racism protests in central London on Saturday, London police chief Cressida Dick saidAfter a largely peaceful day, small numbers of protesters briefly clashed with mounted police on Saturday after thousands gathered to voice their anger at police brutality after the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis.“I am deeply saddened and depressed that a minority of protesters became violent towards officers in central London yesterday evening. This led to 14 officers being injured,” Dick, who is commissioner of the Metropolitan Police Service, said in a statement.“The number of assaults is shocking and completely unacceptable.”The police said 13 officers were also hurt in protests earlier in the week and a number of arrests had been made.British artist Banksy showed his support for the Black Lives Matter movement with a painting he posted to his Instagram account on Saturday portraying a candle vigil under a US flag.In the post, the secretive artist, who rose to fame for his graffiti, writes that the system is failing people of colour, and it is the responsibility of white people to fix the system, not theirs. A post shared by Banksy (@banksy) on Jun 6, 2020 at 3:30am PDTRead more here.Tens of thousands of demonstrators rallied in Washington, DC, and other US cities on Saturday, demanding an end to racism and brutality by law enforcement, as protests sparked by the police killing of George Floyd stretched into the 12th day.A Lincoln Memorial rally and march to the White House marked the largest outpouring yet of protests nationwide since video footage emerged showing Floyd, an unarmed Black man in handcuffs, lying face down and struggling to breathe as a white police officer knelt on his neck.Floyd’s May 25 death has sparked a storm of protests in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, thrusting the highly charged debate over racial justice back to the forefront of the political agenda five months before the US presidential election.More photographs here.Anti-racism protests attended by thousands of people in London and other major UK cities “undoubtedly” risk causing an increase in the number of COVID-19 cases again, British Health Minister Matt Hancock said.Thousands of people attended protests on Saturday to voice their anger at police brutality after the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, ignoring government advice to avoid large gatherings due to the risk from coronavirus.Asked during an interview on Sky News whether the number attending protests made an increase in COVID-19 cases more likely, Hancock said: “It is undoubtedly a risk.”“I support very strongly the argument that is being made by those who are protesting … but the virus itself doesn’t discriminate and gathering in large groups is temporarily against the rules precisely because it increases the risk of the spread of this virus.” Australians who defied public health rules and rallied in support of the US Black Lives Matter movement were reckless and self-indulgent, Finance Minister Mathias Cormann said.More than 20,000 people protested in Sydney and other cities on Saturday, in solidarity with the US anger over the killing of George Floyd and calling for an end to similar deaths of Indigenous Australians.Cormann said the protesters risked a second outbreak of the novel coronavirus.“I think it is incredibly selfish,” Cormann told Sky News. “It’s incredibly self-indulgent.”Australia has had 7,255 cases of the coronavirus and 102 deaths, avoiding the higher tolls seen elsewhere because of border closures and strict social distancing since March.A senior aide to President Donald Trump apologised for promoting a racially-charged video on her Twitter feed.Mercedes Schlapp, a senior Trump national spokeswoman, said she “deeply apologized” for retweeting a video of a chainsaw-wielding man in Texas shouting at anti-racist protesters, in which he used a racial slur.“I retweeted without watching the full video. I deleted the tweet. I would never knowingly promote the use of that word,” Schlapp said in an email to Reuters.Thousands of people around the world have rallied in solidarity with anti-racism protests in the United States following the police killing of George Floyd on May 25.Outside the US, large protests have also erupted in many cities around the world. Wearing black and braving a blistering sun, Jamaicans gathered on Saturday to support global protests against police abuses sparked by the death of George Floyd.Several hundred people stood outside the US Embassy in Kingston with signs and t-shirts reading “Black Lives Matter” and “Enough is Enough”, demanding justice for Floyd as well as Jamaicans who have died at the hands of security forces.The Kingston protests were peaceful, and police mostly stood by watching as demonstrators voiced their concerns. According to a government-backed study, over 3,000 Jamaicans have been killed by law enforcement officials since 2000.Thousands of demonstrators filled the streets in San Francisco, Sacramento, Simi Valley, San Diego, Los Angeles and elsewhere across California.In Los Angeles, protesters organised by Refuse Fascism LA took over Hollywood Boulevard, chanting “Revolution, nothing less!”In San Diego, more than 3,000 people marched downtown and faced off with officers guarding police headquarters, while a caravan of 300 cars moved past the state university there.In Simi Valley, a protest drawing several thousand demonstrators spilled onto the street and stopped traffic on a major road through the suburban town northwest of Los Angeles. It was there that four white Los Angeles police officers were found not guilty of beating motorist Rodney King, sparking riots in 1992.On Saturday, marchers there carried signs with messages including “We stand together” and “Change is now.” Some of them thanked police officers as they passed by them.In Huntington Beach, police officers reportedly separated protesters at a beachside rally from a few dozen counter-protesters who waved American flags and pro-Trump signs. A fight broke out amid the scrum, and one person was detained.Demonstrations in recent days have generally been boisterous but non-violent, in contrast to last weekend when some protesters smashed windows, burned police cars and confronted cordons of riot-clad police who fired tear gas and rubber bullets. Gone, too, was most of the looting that ransacked dozens of stores and that authorities say appeared mainly to be the work of non-protesters.Protesters chanting “Black Lives Matter” and “George Floyd” converged on the US capital on Saturday, thronging the streets from the Capitol building to a barricaded White House and the Lincoln Memorial, in the largest protest the city has yet seen.Military vehicles and officers in fatigues had closed off much of downtown Washington, DC, to traffic, as protesters stirred by the death of George Floyd – who died on May 25 after a white police officer in Minneapolis knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes – flooded the streets chanting and carrying signs including “Get your knee off our necks.”The White House has been fortified with new fencing and extra security precautions. Most businesses around the downtown area have their windows boarded shut.A man standing behind a table handed out water, snacks and paper towels to demonstrators. The few police and security officers in sight wore patrol uniforms rather than body armour and helmets, and had a more relaxed posture than in days prior.The mood across the capital seemed jubilant. The White House said the president had no public events scheduled for Saturday. It was unclear if, behind the new fence, he could hear the crowds filling the city, at one point chanting: “This is what democracy looks like.”A large protest kicked off in Seattle for the ninth consecutive day of protests over the death of George Floyd.Thousands of doctors, nurses and others, many in lab coats and scrubs, marched to City Hall in demonstrations that are among the largest Seattle has seen in years.After police were severely criticised for using tear gas and pepper spray to disperse largely peaceful crowds, Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan and Police Chief Carmen Best imposed a 30-day moratorium on the department’s use of one kind of tear gas.Washington, DC, Mayor Muriel Bowser joined protesters gathered in the US capital, telling them “we pushed the army away from our city”, according to the Washington Post.Bowser has been a vocal proponent of the protests, naming a plaza near the White House “Black Lives Matter Plaza”. Active members of the military had been stationed outside the city during previous days, while members of the National Guard had been deployed near the White House and other parts of the capital.Bowser, in a June 4 letter, had called on Trump to withdraw the “extraordinary federal law enforcement and military presence”. The Pentagon soon after ordered the troops to return home. “Black Lives Matter!” has been painted in massive letters stretching for two blocks on California’s Capitol Mall, a main avenue that leads to the California State Capitol.A local artist Demetris “BAMR” Washington urged volunteers on Friday to help paint the message, after saying he had received approval from the area’s councilman.On Saturday, the artist posted on Instagram that about 300 people had come out to help. TEAMWORK MADE THE DREAMWORK! SACRAMENTO, I tip my hat to you and will be forever grateful that y'all gave me this experience! With at least 300 helpers, we were able to finsh this in 5 hours! I'm still sore/ exhausted but hoping to make it to the rally at 10 am this morning. Big thank you to @guysonthegrid for waking up at 5 am to get this drone footage! You a blessing foreal!

Many carried signs saying such things as “Vote Him Out” and “Don’t Be A Bunker Boy,” the latter a reference to reports that Trump went into the White House bunker when protests in Washington became more violent. Trump insists he only went briefly, for an inspection.Thousands of protesters marched in Washington, DC, as rallies across the US to protest the killing of George Floyd enter a 12th day and officials move to rein in law enforcement tactics.Some activists have called on social media for a million people to attend Saturday’s rally in the US capital. Local media has predicted tens of thousands will attend.“This is by far the most protesters we’ve seen descend on the White House and make their voices heard since these protests began 12 days ago,” Al Jazeera’s Heidi Zhou-Castro reported from the protest.British anti-racism protesters briefly clashed with mounted police after thousands gathered in central London to voice their anger at police brutality after the killing of George Floyd.After a largely peaceful day, small numbers of protesters near Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s Downing Street residence threw bottles at police, and mounted officers charged at protesters to push them back.Earlier, more than a thousand protesters marched past the US embassy on the south bank of the River Thames, blocking traffic and holding placards.Police in the German city of Hamburg used pepper spray on protesters and were ready to deploy water cannon as some demonstrations in support of US anti-racist protests turned ugly.Hamburg police tweeted that several hundred “hooded and aggressive people” had put pressure on police officers in the city centre, adding: “We have already had to use pepper spray. With all due respect for emotions: attacks on police officers are unacceptable!”At another location nearby, they said some 350 people were standing in front of police water cannons. “We regard this as an unauthorised (forbidden) meeting and now we are calling via loudspeaker announcements for people to leave.”Hundreds of mourners have begun to gather at a church in North Carolina on Saturday for a memorial service for George Floyd in his home state.Crowds about 100 deep lined both sides of the entrance as a hearse bearing Floyd’s coffin arrived at a church in Raeford.As the casket rolled in, chants of “Black power,” and “George Floyd” and “no justice, no peace,” echoed from beneath the covered entrance.Taking a knee, banging drums and ignoring physical distancing measures, outraged protesters from Sydney to London kicked off global rallies against racism and police brutality on Saturday.The death of George Floyd, an unarmed Black man, at the hands of police in Minnesota, has brought tens of thousands out onto the streets during a pandemic that is ebbing in Asia and Europe but still spreading in other parts of the world.Read more here.Two Buffalo police officers were arraigned on felony assault charges on Saturday after a viral video viewed by more than 78 million people showed them pushing an elderly protester to the ground, injuring him.Officers Aaron Torgalski and Robert McCabe, who have been suspended from the department, were part of a unit in tactical gear enforcing an 8pm curfew on Thursday when Martin Gugino, 75, was shoved, fell and struck his head on the sidewalk, the Buffalo News reported.Both pleaded not guilty to second-degree assault during the virtual arraignment before Buffalo City Court Judge Craig D Hannah, the Buffalo News reported. Fifty-seven police officers have since resigned in solidarity with the two officers.Demonstrators in Paris have tried to gather in front of the US embassy, defying restrictions on planned gatherings imposed by authorities in light of the coronavirus pandemic.They were met by riot police. The embassy was sealed off behind an imposing ring of metal barriers and roadblocks, but many protesters gathered nearby.“You can fine me 10,000 or 20,000 times, the revolt will happen anyway,” Egountchi Behanzin, a founder of the Black African Defense League, told officers who stopped him to check his ID documents before he approached the building, according to The Associated Press news agency.After another mostly peaceful night, more demonstrations were planned for Saturday in New York City amid lingering tension between protesters and police over the city’s 8pm curfew.On Friday night, demonstrators again remained on city streets hours after the curfew. With police generally allowing some leeway, crowds mostly dwindled on their own at various locations.But there were some minor flare-ups: About an hour after a Brooklyn protest ended, images on social media showed officers surrounding a group of protesters and chasing down some with batons.Protesters are expected to gather in Washington, DC, for a huge demonstration on Saturday, its police chief said.Activists have called on social media for a million people to attend the protest in the US capital.“We have a lot of public, open-source information to suggest that the event on this upcoming Saturday may be one of the largest we’ve ever had in the city,” Washington, DC, Police Chief Peter Newsham told local media, adding that much of the city centre would be closed to traffic from early in the day.Newsham did not give a crowd estimate. Local media has predicted tens of thousands of attendees.As we make our voices heard, please continue to look out for one another. It’s crowded and many children are now also peacefully demonstrating. Let’s continue to show the world our #DCvalues. pic.twitter.com/Rj1NkRwh7O— Mayor Muriel Bowser (@MayorBowser) June 6, 2020Thousands of demonstrators protested in rainy central London against police violence and racial injustice following the killing of George Floyd.Gathering in Parliament Square, a traditional venue for protests, the demonstrators “took the knee” in silence and then chanted Floyd’s name before applauding his memory.The demonstrators have ignored advice from the government and police to avoid attending because of the coronavirus. In England, gatherings are limited to groups of six, provided people observe physical distancing guidelines.Many held banners, including one that read “Racism is a Pandemic”. Demonstrations supporting the Black Lives Matter movement took place in Manchester, Cardiff in Wales and other UK cities.Protesters gathered in Tokyo on Saturday, as global demonstrations over the killing of George Floyd spread to Japan, a nation not usually associated with mass discontent or police violence.In front of Shibuya train station, an iconic landmark in Tokyo, people held signs that said, “End racism,” and “We stand with you”.Although the turnout was a fraction of the thousands in American and European cities, the effort was symbolically significant.Serbian footballer Aleksandar Katai has been released by LA Galaxy after his wife posted “racist and violent” messages on social media.Galaxy announced they would “mutually part ways” with their new winger on Friday in a one-sentence news release.Tea Katai made the posts on her Instagram story earlier this week. They included a photo with a caption written in Serbian urging police to “kill” protesters, another referring to protesters as “disgusting cattle,” and a third sharing a racist meme.The Galaxy met with Aleksandar Katai on Thursday. He disavowed his wife’s posts late Wednesday night, saying the “views are not ones that I share and are not tolerated in my family”.Galaxy fans have been calling for his dismissal. On Thursday, a handful of fans gathered by the David Beckham statue outside the club’s stadium holding a banner reading “No Racists in Our Club”.Roger Goodell, commissioner of the US National Football League (NFL), has said the league made mistakes in not listening to players, in a video denouncing racism in the country amid widespread protests over police brutality against Black people.“We, the National Football League, admit we were wrong for not listening to NFL players earlier and encourage all to speak out and peacefully protest,” Goodell said in the video published on Friday.“We, the National Football League, believe Black lives matter.”Read more here.Thousands of demonstrators held mostly peaceful protests across Australia on Saturday to honour the memory of George Floyd and to protest the deaths of Indigenous Australians in custody. Black Lives Matter protesters poured into downtown Melbourne amid a strong police presence, with aerial footage showing the true scale of the march.In Adelaide, crowds filled the city’s Victoria Square after police gave special permission on Friday for the event to proceed despite COVID-19 restrictions.South Australia Police Assistant Commissioner Peter Harvey said he was “very pleased” with how the “exceptionally good behaviour by everyone who was here today”.Organisers of Australia’s Black Lives Matter rallies said about 30,000 people gathered in Brisbane, the capital of Queensland, forcing police to close down two major streets.The rally appeared orderly as police handed out masks to protesters and other officials provided hand sanitisers.A Maori group did a traditional haka, or war dance, during the Brisbane protest. The large crowd later marched to a local police precinct, some chanting: “They say justice, we say murder.”The news helicopter has gone up.

This isn’t a controversial statement,” read the joint statement from Jordan and his company on Friday. “Until the ingrained racism that allows our country’s institutions to fail is completely eradicated, we will remain committed to protecting and improving the lives of Black people.”Part of the initiative involves creating greater access to education.“Through our Jordan Wings program, we have been focused on providing access to education, mentorship and opportunity for Black youth facing the obstacles of systemic racism,” Jordan Brand president Craig Williams said in a statement.Mark Zuckerberg, chief executive of Facebook, promised to review the social network’s policies that led to its decision to not moderate controversial messages posted by the US president that appeared to encourage violence against those protesting against police racism.In a letter to employees, Zuckerberg wrote: “We’re going to review our policies allowing discussion and threats of state use of force to see if there are any amendments we should adopt.”This, he said, includes “excessive use of police or state force. Given the sensitive history in the US, this deserves special consideration.”A US District Court Judge ordered Denver police to stop using tear gas, plastic bullets and other “less-than-lethal” force such as flash grenades against protesters in the city.The temporary injunction is in response to a local lawsuit filed by protesters complaining about excessive force used by officers during public demonstrations following Floyd’s death.“The Denver Police Department has failed in its duty to police its own,” Judge R Brooke Jackson wrote in the ruling.“The Court has reviewed video evidence of numerous incidents in which officers used pepper spray on individual demonstrators who appeared to be standing peacefully, some of whom were speaking to or yelling at the officers, none of whom appeared to be engaging in violence or destructive behavior,” Jackson wrote.The first of several Black Lives Matter protests across Australia got underway in Adelaide as a court in Sydney banned a planned rally in the city citing the risk of coronavirus transmissions.Huge crowds were seen in the first gathering in the southern city of Adelaide, which was held to honour George Floyd and to protest against the deaths of Indigenous Australians in custody.Huge turn out at Adelaide rally.  @7NewsAdelaide pic.twitter.com/sKiGUFNLhQ— Michael Smyth (@MichaelSmyth_) June 6, 2020Thousands of people are rallying in Victoria Square for today’s anti-racism protest in Adelaide.

But New South Wales state Supreme Court Justice Des Fagan ruled on Friday that the rally was not an authorised public assembly. Fagan said he understood the rally was designed to coincide with similar events in other countries.“I don’t diminish the importance of the issues and no one would deny them in normal circumstances,” he said. “No one denies them that but we’re talking about a situation of a health crisis.”Residents of Minneapolis and Saint Paul, Minnesota were no longer under a curfew on Friday night and the state is planning to start sending state troopers and US National Guard members back home.Governor Tim Walz credited peaceful protests for helping achieve rapid change in Minneapolis Police Department policy. On Friday, the city agreed to ban chokeholds and neck restraints as a civil rights investigation of the department begins.Seattle’s mayor has banned the police use of tear gas as protests continue against the killing of George Floyd.Mayor Jenny Durkan said at a news conference on Friday that the ban would last for 30 days.The move came hours after three civilian police watchdog groups urged city leaders to ban the use of tear gas to control demonstrators. The groups said the move would build public trust and should remain in place until the department adopts policies and training for use of the chemical agent.California Governor Gavin Newsom has ordered the state police training programme to stop teaching officers how to use a hold that can block the flow of blood to the brain.Newsom, a Democrat, took the action after two weeks of protests across the country prompted by the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis.Floyd died on May 25 after a police officer put his knee on his neck for nearly nine minutes.Since then, some police departments have moved to end the use of carotid holds that stop or slow the flow of blood to the brain. Newsom said that hold has no place in the 21st century.An Emory University infectious disease specialist says he has serious concerns that police could be spreading the coronavirus by spraying tear gas on demonstrators.Mass arrests and confining people in small spaces dramatically increase the risk of infecting others with the coronavirus, Dr Jay Varkey said on Friday.Tear gas and other chemical agents causes people to rub their eyes, putting demonstrators at risk of being infected, Varkey said.“When I see the wide use of things like tear gas or pepper bombs that by its nature cause people to immediately rub their eyes, that causes me tremendous consternation in terms of the risk of what that could cause in terms of infection transmission during a pandemic,” Varkey said.“From a public health standpoint, I don’t know whether law enforcement is actively looking at agents other than tear gas or pepper bombs,” he said. “As a physician, do I think they should? Yes, absolutely.”South Africa’s president is noting the “naked racism in the United States” and says he firmly believes “this is a moment we should regard as a turning point with regard to tackling racism around the world”.Cyril Ramaphosa spoke as the ruling African National Congress launched a Black Friday event in response to the “heinous murder” of George Floyd and “institutionalised racism” in the US, at home and “wherever it rears its ugly head”.Ramaphosa said human dignity is a universal aspiration and respect for it is “the only guarantee of any nation’s prosperity”. He pointed out that South Africa’s enduring racial inequality a quarter-century after the end of the racist system of apartheid, and he expressed his “deepest regret” at the death of nearly a dozen South Africans allegedly at the hands of security forces during the country’s COVID-19 lockdown.While he said the deaths “do not have the obvious racial dimensions of the murder of George Floyd, they do rely on a similar contempt for the intrinsic human worth of the victim” and must be condemned “just as vehemently”. The cases are under investigation.About 250 people demonstrated peacefully outside the US embassy in the Cypriot capital, Nicosia. to denounce what they said were the “social and racial inequalities” at the root of protests triggered by the death of George Floyd at the hands of a white police officer.Demonstrators wore masks and kept several feet apart in line with social-distancing rules. They held placards reading, “We say no to racism, solidarity is our weapon,” and chanted slogans including “Power to the people, united we breathe”.Police observed Friday’s hour-long protest from a distance as demonstrators knelt and held out clenched fists in a show of solidarity with protesters in the US.A protestor holds a placard that reads in Greek, \"We say no to Racism, Solidarity is our Weapon\", outside the U.S. embassy in Nicosia, Cyprus, Friday, June 5, 2020, during a demonstration against the recent killing of George Floyd by police officers USA.

EDON Central Committee member Christoforos Pittara decried what he called the endemic racial inequality that still plagues the US, and criticised US President Donald Trump for resorting to racist rhetoric.Pittara said justice for George Floyd is not enough and must be served for a “chain of murders” whose victims were not only African Americans, but the poor and dispossessed irrespective of race, creed or colour.The mayor of Tacoma, Washington has told the city manager to fire four police officers following the death of a Black man after police restrained him in March.Mayor Victoria Woodards on Thursday night directed City Manager Elizabeth Pauli to fire the officers involved in the restraint of 33-year-old Manuel Ellis.Her order comes as the country has been roiled by the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Four Minneapolis officers have been criminally charged. Woodards said the Tacoma officers should also be prosecuted over the death of Ellis.“The officers who committed this crime should be fired and prosecuted to the full extent of the law,” Woodards said in a statement aired live on Tacoma television and Facebook. “I am demanding tonight that the Pierce County Sheriff review and confirm every action taken by each officer.”The News Tribune reports the Pierce County medical examiner’s office ruled Ellis’s March 3 death a homicide caused by a lack of oxygen due to physical restraint. The newspaper reports methamphetamine intoxication and heart disease were contributing factors.Authorities have said Ellis appeared to be suffering from some sort of breakdown when they approached him. They said he attacked officers who were trying to calm him down.The National Football League (NFL) on Friday reversed its long-standing antagonism towards the practice of taking a knee to protest over police injustice against Black Americans, championed by ostracised player Colin Kaepernick, saying it was wrong not to listen to NFL players on the subject as it encouraged people to protest peacefully.In a video statement tweeted by the US league, Commissioner Roger Goodell said, “We, the National Football League condemn racism and the systematic oppression of Black People … We, the National Football League believe Black lives matter.”We, the NFL, condemn racism and the systematic oppression of Black People. We, the NFL, admit we were wrong for not listening to NFL players earlier and encourage all to speak out and peacefully protest. We, the NFL, believe Black Lives Matter. #InspireChange pic.twitter.com/ENWQP8A0sv— NFL (@NFL) June 5, 2020Politicians, team owners and fellow players previously criticised Kaepernick and fans burned his jersey for taking a knee during the national anthem to protest violence against Black Americans. Now, in the wake of the George Floyd protests, global opinion has shifted so much that more people are now vilifying those who attack Kaepernick or misrepresent his stance.New Orleans Saints star quarterback Drew Brees issued a public apology on Thursday after he was excoriated by teammates, other athletes and fans for saying he “will never agree with anybody disrespecting the flag of the United States”.Even US President Donald Trump echoed the earlier criticism on Friday, saying on Twitter that Brees should not have taken back his original stance.I am a big fan of Drew Brees. I think he’s truly one of the greatest quarterbacks, but he should not have taken back his original stance on honoring our magnificent American Flag. OLD GLORY is to be revered, cherished, and flown high…— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 5, 2020Trump posted his tweet not long after several members of the Jacksonsville Jaguars marched from their stadium to the steps of the local sheriff’s department in Florida to protest against the Floyd killing.“Today we say no more,” wide receiver Chris Conley said. “Today we see a nation that can’t await change, a city that won’t sit still or be quiet.”The march included Joshua Dobbs, Brandon Linder and Josh Lambo of the Jaguars along with family members. Coach Doug Marrone, general manager Dave Caldwell and assistant coach Terry Robiskie also walked in what the team called an attempt to “raise awareness for racial injustices against the Black community,” with many wearing “Black Lives Matter” T-shirts.In a speech in Delaware on Friday, US presidential candidate Joe Biden sharply criticised US President Donald Trump for invoking George Floyd’s name during a news conference about a positive jobs report released that morning.At the news conference, Trump suggested that Floyd might have appreciated the recent protests and the debates they have sparked as being a “great day for him”.Biden called the comments “despicable”.“For the president to try to put any other words in the mouth of George Floyd, I frankly think it’s despicable,” he said. “And the fact that he did so on the day when black unemployment rose, Hispanic unemployment rose, black youth unemployment skyrocketed, tells you everything you need to know about this man and what he really cares about.”Hundreds of journalists from across the globe have gotten caught in the crossfire between protesters demonstrating against the death of George Floyd and law enforcement officials attempting to rein them in. Some have been deliberately targeted by those law enforcement officials, as a video compilation by the Committee to Protect Journalists demonstrates. Since the protests began on May 26, more than 250 abridgments of press freedom have been reported across the US by journalists covering the demonstrations, according to the CPJ.Since the death of #GeorgeFloyd in police custody sparked #protests across the U.S., police have assaulted and arrested journalists covering them—in some cases causing serious injury. CPJ's @MustafaHameed compiled some of the shocking moments caught on video. #PressFreedom pic.twitter.com/LCgGurJ91r— Committee to Protect Journalists (@pressfreedom) June 5, 2020Canadian protesters chanted “Stand up to Trump!” to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau as he joined thousands at an anti-racism rally on Friday and took a knee alongside protesters.Trudeau, wearing a black mask and surrounded by bodyguards, made a surprise appearance at the “No justice = No peace” rally in front of Parliament. His appearance came a day after police shot and killed an Indigenous woman during a wellness check in eastern Canada.Trudeau three times took a knee alongside other protesters, a gesture used to protest against police brutality and the treatment of African Americans by police. Afterwards, several people thanked Trudeau for kneeling.Trudeau did not speak at the rally on Friday and left as the protesters began a march to the US Embassy, near the Parliament building.Facebook Inc said on Friday that it had seen no evidence of coordinated foreign interference on its platforms targeting anti-racism protests in the US, despite assertions from the US attorney general that foreign groups were trying to exacerbate the situation.“We have been actively looking and we haven’t yet seen foreign interference or domestic coordinated inauthentic behaviour targeting these protests,” said Nathaniel Gleicher, Facebook’s head of cybersecurity policy, in a call with reporters.“We want to caution people against jumping to conclusions without clear evidence of foreign interference,” Gleicher said.US Attorney General William Barr said on Thursday that foreign groups were using disinformation campaigns like those mounted by Russia during the 2016 presidential election to widen divisions in US society.“Some of the foreign hackers and groups that are associated with foreign governments are focusing in on this particular situation we have here and trying to exacerbate it in every way they can,” Barr said.US Park Police (USPP) spokesperson Sergeant Eduardo Delgado admitted on Friday that it was a “mistake” to deny that tear gas was used to disperse peaceful protesters ahead of a controversial photo opportunity for President Donald Trump in front of a Washington, DC church.Media reports challenged a Tuesday statement from the Park Police that said tear gas was not used to “secure” the area in downtown DC where Trump took a photo in front of a church that was damaged during protests against police brutality.The statement said smoke bombs and pepper spray projectiles were used, but did not consider these to be tear gas.“I’m not saying it’s not a tear gas, but I’m just saying we use a pepper ball that shoots a powder”, Delgado said in an interview with Vox.“The point is we admitted to using what we used,” Delgado said. “I think the term ‘tear gas’ doesn’t even matter anymore. It was a mistake on our part for using ‘tear gas’ because we just assumed people would think CS or CN”.CS and CN are two common types of tear gas, Vox reported.Delgado said the USPP statement was correct in relation to the conduct of the park police.The Pentagon will be sending back the remaining 900 active-duty troops who were sent to the Washington, DC area to potentially respond to civil unrest, and they are expected to start heading back to their home bases, a US official told Reuters news agency.The official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said the order had been signed by US Defense Secretary Mark Esper and that the troops would be heading back to Fort Bragg in North Carolina and Fort Drum in New York.The report came after Utah Senator Mike Lee tweeted that DC Mayor Muriel Bowser was ‘kicking’ National Guard troops out of hotels in the US capital.Just heard that Mayor Bowser is kicking the Utah National Guard out of all DC hotels tomorrow. More than 1200 troops from 10 states are being evicted. This is unacceptable. 1/2— Mike Lee (@SenMikeLee) June 5, 2020Negotiators for the city of Minneapolis have agreed with the state to ban the use of chokeholds by police, and to require police to report and intervene any time they see an unauthorised use of force by another officer.The moves are part of a stipulation between the city and the Minnesota Department of Human Rights, which launched a civil rights investigation this week in response to the death of George Floyd in police custody. The City Council is expected to approve the agreement Friday.The agreement, which will be enforceable in court, would require any officers, regardless of tenure or rank, to immediately report the use of any neck restraint or chokehold from the scene to their commander or their commander’s superiors.Similarly, any officer who sees another officer commit any unauthorised use of force, including any chokehold or neck restraint, must try to intervene verbally and even physically. If they do not, they will be subject to discipline as severe as if they themselves had used the prohibited force.The agreement also requires authorisation from the police chief or a designated deputy chief to use crowd control weapons, including chemical agents, rubber bullets, flash-bangs, batons, and marking rounds. And it requires more timely decisions on disciplining officers.The Nuu-chah-nulth Tribal Council in Canada has called for an independent investigation into the fatal police shooting of Chantel Moore.Moore, 26, was reportedly killed as police carried out a wellness check in northwestern New Brunswick.Police say Moore ran out of her home with a knife and threatened the officer who shot her.These deaths happened within the past month, two in the past week. Who do we call when our family members are in need help? We obviously can't call the police, I'm not comfortable with calling the police.

He was reportedly concerned because she had been harassed, including by receiving “strange” messages on Facebook.Quebec’s independent police watchdog group has sent several investigators to the area to determine the circumstances surrounding the shooting.“The family and community of Chantal need answers as to why she was shot on a health check by the police,” the Nuu-chah-nulth Tribal Council said. “Justice must not wait and every power must be exerted to ensure that justice is served in an appropriate immediate, and respectful way.”The Nuu-chah-nulth Tribal Council is calling for an immediate independent investigation into the death of Chantel Moore. \"The family and community of Chantel needs answers as to why she was shot on a health check by police.

The man falls backward and hits his head on the pavement. Blood leaks out as officers walk past.The mayor, Byron Brown, said in a statement that the man, who hasn’t been publicly identified, was in serious condition. A hospital official said he was “alert and oriented”, Erie County Executive Mark Poloncarz tweeted Friday morning.The district attorney’s office “continues to investigate the incident”, officials said in a news release.New York Governor Andrew Cuomo endorsed the suspensions, tweeting that what was seen on video was “wholly unjustified and utterly disgraceful”.A man who was with George Floyd on the night he died said his friend did not resist arrest and instead tried to defuse the situation before he ended up handcuffed on the ground and pleading for air as an officer pressed a knee against his neck.Maurice Lester Hall, a longtime friend of Floyd, was a passenger in Floyd’s car when police approached him May 25 as they responded to a call about someone using a forged bill at a shop. Hall told The New York Times that Floyd was trying to show he was not resisting.“I could hear him pleading, ‘Please, officer, what’s all this for?'” Hall told the newspaper.Hall is a key witness in the state’s investigation into the four officers who apprehended Floyd. Derek Chauvin, the white officer who continued pressing his knee into Floyd’s neck even after Floyd became motionless, is charged with second-degree murder, third-degree murder and manslaughter. The three other officers are charged with aiding and abetting. All four officers were fired.Muriel Bowser, the mayor of Washington, DC, has renamed a section of a street near the White House “Black Lives Matter Plaza”.The move comes just days after peaceful protesters were forcefully cleared to make space for a Trump photo op. Rights groups, including Black Lives Matter, have sued Trump and several officials with his administration over the incident. The section of 16th street in front of the White House is now officially “Black Lives Matter Plaza”. pic.twitter.com/bbJgAYE35b— Mayor Muriel Bowser (@MayorBowser) June 5, 2020President Donald Trump is facing further criticism after making remarks about George Floyd during his news conference on job gains in the US.“Hopefully George is looking down right now and saying this is a great thing that’s happening for our country. This is a great day for him. It’s a great day for everybody”, Trump said.The remarks drew immediate ire from observers and journalists present, who questioned how Floyd would enjoy unemployment numbers after being killed.“How is this a great day for George Floyd?” I shouted to President Trump, before he turned and exited the Rose Garden without taking a single question. https://t.co/ks60ONgeUn— Peter Alexander (@PeterAlexander) June 5, 2020Trump finished his news conference without taking questions, a move that observers have also criticised.US unemployment figures dropped to slightly over 13 percent, new figures from May show.Trump attributed these figures to his administration’s response to the coronavirus, including pushing states to reopen their economies.The US has nearly 1.9 million confirmed coronavirus cases. There have been over 108,000 US deaths since the pandemic began spreading in March.Minnesota’s county attorneys want to give the state attorney general the authority to handle all cases of police-involved deaths.The Minnesota County Attorneys Association voted Thursday in transferring that power during an emergency meeting, which included Attorney General Keith Ellison. The attorney general is leading the state’s case against the four police officers involved in George Floyd’s death instead of the Hennepin County Attorney’s Office.State lawmakers would need to pass legislation during this month’s special session to give the attorney general the ongoing authority.The county attorneys are also calling on the legislature to provide additional funding to the state attorney general’s office and create a unit within Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension to investigate police killings of civilians.“If this is the path the legislature and governor choose to take, my office will accept the responsibility,” Ellison said. “But it must come with resources sufficient to do the job thoroughly and to do justice in the way Minnesotans have a right to expect.”Ellison is one of 18 Democratic attorneys general who are asking Congress to grant their offices “clear statutory authority under federal law” to investigate “unconstitutional policing by local police departments” in their respective states, the Star Tribune reported.Parts of a major Washington, DC street were blocked off so that large, yellow letters that spell out “Black Lives Matter” could be painted on the road.On the road that leads to the White House, the #WashingtonDC government is painting “Black Lives Matter” with local muralists.

If the council approves the agreement, the order would require court approval.The state human rights department opened a civil rights investigation into allegations of racial discrimination by the police department on Tuesday. The investigation into policies, procedures and practices seeks to determine if the force has engaged in systematic discriminatory practices toward people of colour and to ensure that any such practices are stopped.A 176-year-old slave auction block has been removed from a Virginia city’s downtown and will be displayed in a museum.The 800-pound stone was pulled from the ground at a Fredericksburg street corner early Friday after its removal was delayed for months by lawsuits and the coronavirus pandemic, The Free Lance-Star reported.The weathered stone was sprayed with graffiti twice and chants of “move the block” erupted this week during local demonstrations over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis, city officials said in a statement announcing the removal.The slave auction block in Fredericksburg, Virginia has been removed. pic.twitter.com/NBYNlzRNNA— Kevin M. Levin (@KevinLevin) June 5, 2020A local chapter of the NAACP called for the stone’s removal in 2017, saying it was a relic of “a time of hatred and degradation”.In 2019, the City Council voted for the block’s removal and relocation to the Fredericksburg Area Museum. A judge upheld that decision in February after two businesses near the auction block sued to stop the relocation.The museum plans to display the knee-high stone in an exhibit chronicling the “movement from slavery to accomplishments by the local African American community.”European Union lawmakers are expressing concern about US police action linked to the death of George Floyd.The incidents were debated by the European Parliament’s Subcommittee on Human Rights as the protest movement since Floyd’s death gathered pace in Europe and around the world.Finnish Greens lawmaker Heidi Hautala says “the police should not be there to shoot when some loot. The police should be there to protect, and it is clear that widespread reforms in the law enforcement in the United States are needed.”Irish EU lawmaker Sean Kelly says some of the problem is due to a failure of leadership. He says what happened in the US is “chilling in the extreme. I think it indicates what can happen when you have poor leadership.”“Leaders can either divide or unite,” said Kelly. “Good unite. Bad divide. That’s what we see unfortunately in America at the moment.”Swedish liberal parliamentarian Karin Karlsbro said, “America has a long and tragic history on police brutality. At the heart of this lies racism and segregation based on history. This is a systematic problem that needs to be addressed at all levels in the US.”The city of Mobile, Alabama, removed a Confederate statue early Friday.The bronze figure of Admiral Raphael Semmes had become a flashpoint for protests. It was removed from its pedestal after being vandalised this week and before demonstrations announced for Sunday calling for it to be taken down.The removal of the 120-year-old figure follows days of protests in Alabama and across the nation over killings by police of African-Americans.Mobile removes Confederate statue without warning overnight after days of George Floyd protests.It’s not yet clear why the statue was taken down.

    "Calls grow for the prosecution of four Minneapolis police officers over the death of George Floyd, an unarmed Black man.Pressure is mounting in the US state of Minnesota for prosecutors to bring charges against four Minneapolis police officers over the death of George Floyd, an unarmed Black man.“What we saw was a public lynching without a rope,” said Leslie Redmond, president of the Minneapolis chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP).“Enough is enough. We are done dying,” Redmond told Al Jazeera. “We want to see them prosecuted.”In emotional appeals on US news channels, Floyd’s family demanded justice. “These officers, they need to be arrested right now, the people want justice right now,” Philonise Floyd, George’s brother, told CNN on Thursday morning. “They need to be convicted and get the death penalty,” Philonise Floyd said.Bridgett Floyd, George’s sister, told ABC’s Good Morning America programme on Wednesday that “those guys need to be put in jail”.“They murdered my brother,” she added.Floyd died at the hospital late on Monday after a white police officer, knelt on the 46-year-old’s neck for several minutes as Floyd moaned and yelled: “I can’t breathe.”A video of the incident shows Floyd pleading with police and eventually appearing motionless as the officer’s knee remained on his neck. Bystanders can be heard urging the officer to get off of Floyd.In a news conference on Wednesday, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey joined calls for the officer who pinned Floyd down to be arrested, asking: “Why is the man who killed George Floyd not in jail?”He added: “If you had done it, or I had done it, we would be behind bars right now.”Medaria Arradondo, the city’s first Black police chief, swiftly fired the four officers involved, a move community leaders acknowledged as “a win”, but said should only be the first step.“I don’t want to undermine how big of a win it was to Chief Arradondo to fire those four officers the same day the footage was shown to the public,” the NAACP’s Redmond said, highlighting that while it was only one officer who pinned Floyd to the ground “all of them were responsible and played a role”.“The next step,” Redmond said, was criminal charges being brought against the four officers – identified as Derek Chauvin, Thomas Lane, Tou Thao and J Alexander Kueng.“What we are seeing is a violation of Black people’s human rights,” Redmond said. “Our humanity has always been denied on American soil.”The Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA) and the FBI are both investigating the incident.The Hennepin County Attorney’s Office, which will handle the case, said in a statement it was “shocked and saddened by what appeared in a recent video”.It added that after the BCA and FBI present their findings, it will make a decision on prosecution.“We promise a thorough, expedited review consistent with our ongoing commitment to justice,” the statement read. “Every person is entitled to fairness; no person stands above the law.”In a joint statement on Thursday, US Attorney Erica MacDonald And FBI Special Agent In Charge Rainer Drolshagen said that the US Justice Department has made the investigation into Floyd’s death a “top priority”. “The federal investigation will determine whether the actions by the involved former Minneapolis Police Department officers violated federal law,” the statement read.Redmond said other Black leaders are pushing for resources to be poured into the community and for police officers to be trained by community members to help bridge the disconnect she says has long existed.The Minneapolis Police Department said on Tuesday Floyd “physically resisted officers”.Security camera footage, obtained by CBS News, shows Floyd sitting on the ground with his hands behind his back and then walking with police out of frame.“Security cameras captured moments before the murder of #GeorgeFloyd,” tweeted prominent civil rights lawyer, Benjamin Crump, who is representing the Floyd family. “He was clearly NOT RESISTING arrest… So WHY did Minneapolis Police officers use excessive force that ultimately resulted in his death?! WE DEMAND ANSWERS.”Security cameras captured moments before the murder of #GeorgeFloyd. He was clearly NOT RESISTING arrest… So WHY did Minneapolis Police officers use excessive force that ultimately resulted in his death?! WE DEMAND ANSWERS. #JusticeForFloyd #SayHisName pic.twitter.com/4yGxvTY2Ln— Ben Crump (@AttorneyCrump) May 27, 2020It is unclear what happens between the time Floyd and police walk out of the frame and the time when a bystander’s video shows an officer pinning Floyd down to the ground with his knee.The Police Officers Federation of Minneapolis issued a statement on Tuesday, saying its officers were cooperating with investigators and urged “now is not the time to rush to judgement”.Calls for justice for Floyd have reverberated across the country, with hundreds of protesters taking their demands to the streets of Minneapolis.On Tuesday night, demonstrators filled the intersection where Floyd was pinned down, chanting “I can’t breathe” and “no justice, no peace”. Floyd’s death has been compared to that of Eric Garner, an unarmed Black man who died in 2014 after being placed in a chokehold by New York City police and pleading: “I can’t breathe.”Video from Tuesday’s demonstration showed police using tear gas against some protesters who marched to a police precinct. There were also reports of non-lethal projectiles being fired by police. Authorities said some protesters destroyed a window of the precinct and sprayed graffiti on police vehicles. Three people were arrested, police said. Riot police were seen using tear gas on protesters for a second night on Wednesday as protesters again took to the streets, calling for charges against the four officers involved in Floyd’s arrest. Looting and vandalism were also reported with video showing some fires in the area of the demonstrations. Hundreds also marched in Los Angeles, California, on Wednesday to demand justice for Floyd and the end to police brutality. ‘Hands up, don’t shoot!’Protesters outside the Minneapolis Police’s 3rd Precinct rallied against the killing of unarmed black man George Floyd. pic.twitter.com/yaOWyVonHG— Al Jazeera English (@AJEnglish) May 28, 2020US President Donald Trump publicly addressed Floyd’s death for the first time on Wednesday afternoon, calling it a “very sad event”.“We’re going to look at it, and we’re going to get a report tomorrow when we get back. And we’re going to get a very full report,” Trump said during a visit to the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. “But a very sad day.”Floyd’s death comes on the heels of several recent cases of a Black man or women being killed by police or former law enforcement.The FBI are also involved in recent investigations in Louisville, Kentucky, and Glynn County, Georgia.In Kentucky, 26-year-old Breonna Taylor was killed by police on March 13 as they served a warrant in a drug investigation. Police said they were returning fire from Taylor’s boyfriend, who said he fired in self-defence, believing someone was breaking into the apartment. No drugs were found.In Georgia, the US Justice Department is weighing hate crime charges in the February 23 shooting death of 25-year-old Ahmaud Arbery, a Black man killed while running in a predominantly white neighbourhood. It took more than two months and a viral video for police to arrest Gregory McMichael, a retired investigator for the local prosecutor’s office, and his son, Travis, both of whom are white. The McMichaels claimed they believed Arbery was involved in a burglary and he was shot in a struggle for Travis McMichael’s gun. Arbery’s mother said she believes her son was just going on a jog.According to the Washington Post Fatal Force database, more than 1,000 people have been shot and killed by police in the last year. According to the database, Black Americans are killed by police at a disproportionate rate.African American adults are nearly six times as likely to be imprisoned or jailed than white adults, according to the Sentencing Project watchdog group.These racial disparities have given rise to Black Lives Matter, which was founded in 2013 and seeks to end police violence and build local power to intervene in violence inflicted on Black communities.",
    "Thousands bid farewell ahead of funeral of the black man whose death inspired worldwide anti-racism protests.George Floyd, whose death sparked worldwide protests, will be laid to rest on Tuesday, next to his mother Larcenia Floyd.Prime Minister Boris Johnson has told his top ministers that there was more to be done to eradicate prejudice and create opportunity in the United Kingdom but society was much less racist than it was before, his spokesman said.“The PM said we are a much, much less racist society than we were but we must also frankly acknowledge that there is so much more to do in eradicating prejudice and creating opportunity.”Johnson also said he “heard” the message from those protesting after the killing of Floyd but that such action should not lead to violence, unlawful actions or the disregarding of social distancing, the spokesman added.“I think the protests – it’s a great starting point … to get your voice heard,” soccer international Raheem Sterling told the BBC, adding that it is time to go beyond debate and start, “implementing change”.Manchester City’s England Sterling has backed anti-racism protests sparked by Floyd’s death. Bon Appetit’s editor-in-chief, Adam Rapoport, have resigned after a 16-year-old picture of him with brownface resurfaced online and drew harsh criticism, coupled with a subsequent claim of discriminatory pay at the Conde Nast-owned US food magazine by a staff editor.The picture, originally posted on the Instagram account of Rapoport’s wife Simone Shubuck in 2013, showed him in brownface makeup with her, according to several media reports. Shubuck’s Instagram account has since been taken private.“From an extremely ill-conceived Halloween costume 16 years ago to my blind spots as an editor, I’ve not championed an inclusive vision,” Rapoport said in a post on Instagram.London mayor Sadiq Khan has ordered a review of the capital’s statues and street names after the toppling of the statue of an English slave trader by anti-racism protesters triggered a debate about the demons of Britain’s imperial past.A statue of Edward Colston, who made a fortune in the 17th century from trading West African slaves, was torn down and thrown into Bristol harbour on Sunday by a group of demonstrators taking part in a wave of protests following the death of Floyd.“Our capital’s diversity is our greatest strength, yet our statues, road names and public spaces reflect a bygone era,” Khan said. He said some statues would be removed.NEW: Today we've unveiled a new commission to review and improve the diversity of London’s public landmarks.

By the time he arrived at the police station, he was unconscious and could not be revived.Medical experts differ on whether Traore died because of the restraint or because of an underlying medical condition. His family and their supporters have demanded that the officers involved be held to account. No one has been charged.In an unprecedented protest in New York City, government employees past and present, joined calls for police reform within their own city.The protest came on the day New York started easing COVID-19 lockdown restrictions. Al Jazeera’s Gabriel Elizondo reports from New York.Japanese public broadcaster NHK has apologised and deleted from its Twitter account an animated video aimed at explaining the background behind US protests for police reform but which sparked online outrage for its depiction of African Americans.The 1:21 minute clip, which NHK had also broadcast, featured a tough-talking black narrator citing the wealth disparity between black and white Americans and the economic impact from the coronavirus.But it made no mention of police brutality or the death of George Floyd.In the clip, the narrator’s bodybuilder-like muscles were bursting out of a white top, while other African-American characters included a man with an afro and mutton chop sideburns, and a muscular man in a sleeveless purple suit, fedora-style hat and sandals strumming a guitar.While we understand @NHK's intent to address complex racial issues in the United States, it's unfortunate that more thought and care didn't go into this video. The caricatures used are offensive and insensitive.— ジョセフ・M・ヤング 駐日米国臨時代理大使 (@USAmbJapan) June 9, 2020George Floyd’s casket has been placed in a hearse and escorted by police back to a funeral home, following a public memorial in a Houston church.About 6,000 people attended the memorial, ahead of a private funeral service on Tuesday.An “admitted” Ku Klux Klan leader who drove a vehicle into a crowd of peaceful Floyd protestors in the US state of Virginia is being investigated for possible hate crimes, a county attorney said.  The man has been charged with several offences after he “recklessly” drove into a crowd on Sunday, Henrico County’s Commonwealth Attorney Shannon Taylor said in a statement posted on Twitter.  US media reported one protester was injured in the incident near Richmond. The person was checked at the scene by emergency responders and refused further treatment.Joined @donlemon on @CNNTonight to share this message: Hate has no home here in Henrico County or the Commonwealth of Virginia. #BlackLivesMatterMore to come in the days ahead. pic.twitter.com/txxfsoneow— Shannon Taylor (@ShannonTaylorVA) June 9, 2020Prosecutors said criminal charges will not be brought against thousands of Los Angeles protesters arrested for violating curfew and other police orders.City Attorney Mike Feuer said his office would develop an alternate court without punishment for those cited for violating curfew or failing to obey orders to leave demonstrations, while District Attorney Jackie Lacey said she would not file charges in protest misdemeanour cases from other parts of Los Angeles County.Police and sheriff’s deputies arrested more than 3,000 people over days of mostly peaceful protests. The vast majority of citations were in Los Angeles for violating curfew or dispersal orders.The American Civil Liberties Union said Floyd’s relatives joined some 600 rights groups to demand the top UN human rights body “urgently” convene a special session to look into a rise of police violence and repression of protests in the US.A spokesman for the Human Rights Council in Geneva confirmed the council office received a letter on Monday from the groups outlining their call for an independent investigation into the recent killings of unarmed Black people in the US as well as one into “violent law enforcement responses to protests”.The call included relatives of Floyd and family members of three other Black people who were killed by the police – Breonna Taylor, Michael Brown and Philando Castile.A vigil was held at Floyd’s high school in Houston, Texas, where his brothers spoke to the crowd and condemned police brutality.“This is bigger than George right now. We’ve got to stop everybody from being afraid of the police,” said Philonise Floyd.Floyd attended the Yates High School in 1993, where brother Rodney Floyd said he was known as a “football star”.The last chance for the public to say goodbye to George Floyd drew thousands of mourners to a church in Houston where he grew up. Reflecting the weight of the moment, the service and public visitation drew the families of Black victims in other high-profile killings whose names have become seared in the US’s conversation over race – among them Eric Garner, Michael Brown, Ahmaud Arbery and Trayvon Martin.“It just hurts,” said Philonise Floyd, George Floyd’s brother, sobbing as he ticked off some of their names outside the Fountain of Praise church. “We will get justice. We will get it. We will not let this door close.”Organisers told Khou TV, a local television station, that 6,362 people attended the service. More here. Four city councillors in Minneapolis who want to dismantle the city’s police have outlined plans to shift funding to community-based programmes to reduce violence and limit the need for a law enforcement force.Councilmember Jeremiah Ellison told the media it could take a year to discuss reform with the public and devise “an entirely new apparatus for public safety” to replace the Minneapolis Police Department.“I think there is this mistake that a lot of folks are making in thinking that we are talking about abolishing safety,” Ellison said. “No, we are talking about abolishing a failure of a police structure that doesn’t keep us safe.”The councillors say they are expecting an amended budget proposal from Mayor Jacob Frey in the coming weeks. US Attorney General William Barr has criticised calls to defund or dismantle police forces and use their budgets for community projects, as demonstrations against police brutality continue.“I think defunding the police, holding the entire police structure responsible for the actions of certain officers is wrong and I think it is dangerous to demonise police,” Barr told the Fox News Channel.“If you pull back the police from these communities there will be, there will be more harm done in these communities,” Barr said.Watch: @BretBaier: If you had to do Monday over again, would you do something different?AG Barr: Based on what I know now, no..

The Minneapolis Star Tribune identified the officers as being from Anoka County Sheriff’s office.A spokesman for the Department of Public Safety, Bruce Gordon, confirmed that: “State Patrol troopers strategically deflated tyres,” Gordon told the paper. “While not a typical tactic, vehicles were being used as dangerous weapons and inhibited our ability to clear areas and keep areas safe where violent protests were occurring.”Cops slashed car tires at protests in Minneapolis.The officers punctured the tires to “stop behaviors such as vehicles driving dangerously and at high speeds in and around protesters and law enforcement,” a Minnesota DPS spokesperson said. https://t.co/qO0fe8wNhK pic.twitter.com/v9CmZymWr7— Mother Jones (@MotherJones) June 8, 2020Among the dozens of vehicle owners whose tyres were damaged was Star Tribune reporter Chris Serres, who was covering the protests on the night of May 30 and returned to his car about 1am. Black Democrats in the Pennsylvania state House of Representatives commandeered the podium for about 90 minutes at the start of the voting session on Monday in an effort to force action on police reform bills.The dramatic takeover was paused when the Republican House speaker said he would consider putting proposals up for votes and that he supports a special session to consider the legislation.The protesters, including veteran Black legislators from Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, hung a “Black Lives Matter” banner from the speaker’s dais and vowed they would not leave without movement on the stalled proposals.The Speaker has agreed to support a special session to address law enforcement reforms.

Minnesota Assistant Attorney General Matthew Frank argued that the “severity of the charges”, as well as the strength of public opinion, made it more likely that Chauvin would flee if set free, the Star Tribune reported.Mourners are paying their respects to George Floyd, whose body is on view at a memorial in a church in his hometown of Houston. Many paused briefly to view Floyd’s body, some making the sign of the cross. Several hundred people stood in line to enter the church before the start of the visitation, all wearing masks. Some held umbrellas for shade as the sun beat down, and temperatures rose to about 32 degrees Celsius (90 Fahrenheit).Those passing through the church were required to leave six feet between themselves and the next person in observation of physical distancing guidelines to stop the spread of the coronavirus.Denver’s police department announced it is changing policies regarding the use of force and body cameras.In a statement, the department said it had banned the use of chokeholds, with no exceptions, effective immediately. Previously, the practice was barred except in lethal encounters, The Denver Post reported.The department also said officers who intentionally point their gun at someone would be required to notify a supervisor and file a report to help collect data on such incidents. Members of its SWAT team will also have to activate their body cameras during tactical operations, the department said.CrossFit founder Greg Glassman has apologised for a tweet that equated Floyd’s killing to the COVID-19 pandemic in which he responded to a tweet by research firm Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation that classified racism and discrimination as a public health issue, saying: “It’s FLOYD-19”.https://twitter.com/CrossFitCEO/status/1269404726581288960?ref_src=twsrc%5EtfwThe fallout was fast.

It was a mistake, not racist but a mistake.”Derek Chauvin, the Minneapolis police officer charged with second-degree murder in George Floyd’s death, is scheduled to make his first court appearance. He is also charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter.Chauvin is being held at a state prison in Oakdale. The three other officers – J Kueng, Thomas Lane and Tou Thao – are charged with aiding and abetting. They remain in the Hennepin County jail on $750,000 bond.The body of George Floyd arrived at a church in Houston for a final public memorial.His body arrived in a gold-coloured coffin that was escorted to The Fountain of Praise church by Houston police. A six-hour viewing open to the public was scheduled to begin in the afternoon.Before the coffin arrived, workers outside the church assembled a large floral arrangement with white roses on one side in the shape of a heart and with the initials “BLM” for Black Lives Matter created from blue roses and placed on top of the heart. The other side of the floral arrangement was made up of red roses and appeared to be in the shape of a raised fist.The legislation addresses excessive use of force, qualified immunity and racial profiling, answering calls from protesters across the country after the death of George Floyd and other Black Americans while in police custody.“It will demilitarise the police by limiting the transfer of military weaponry to state and local police departments,” said Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of the US House of Representatives. It also proposes banning “no-knock” warrants, which allow police officers to enter a residence without warning. The legislation would require support by Republicans who control the upper house of the legislature. Members of the US Congress went down on one knee in Emancipation Hall in the US Capitol building, in silence for eight minutes 46 seconds – the length of time that Floyd spent pinned down by three police officers on a Minneapolis street corner.The two dozen legislators included Nancy Pelosi, speaker of the US House of Representatives. US congressional Democrats plan to unveil a sweeping package of legislation to combat police violence and racial injustice.The proposal is expected to ban police chokeholds and racial profiling, require nationwide use of body cameras, subject police to civilian review boards and abolish the legal doctrine known as “qualified immunity”, which protects police from civil litigation, according to congressional sources.It is unclear whether the proposal will receive support from Republicans, who control the US Senate. Their support, as well as that of Trump, also a Republican, would be needed for the measure to become law.Protesters are pushing to “defund the police”, a chant that has become a rallying cry – and a stick for President Donald Trump to use on Democrats as he tries to portray them as soft on crime.Trump has said he opposes the idea, and is set to meet with members of law enforcement at the White House on Monday afternoon.LAW & ORDER, NOT DEFUND AND ABOLISH THE POLICE.

Listen here. Mourners will be able to view Floyd’s casket Monday in his hometown of Houston, the final stop in a series of memorials in his honour.A six-hour public visitation will be held at The Fountain of Praise church in southwest Houston. Visitors will be required to wear face masks and gloves to comply with coronavirus-related guidelines.Floyd’s funeral will be Tuesday, followed by burial at the Houston Memorial Gardens cemetery in suburban Pearland, where he will be laid to rest next to his mother, Larcenia Floyd.See Sunday’s coverage here.New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio announced on Sunday a series of police reforms that he said were part of a “transformative movement”.Funding would be shifted from the New York Police Department (NYPD) to youth and social services, moving enforcement for street vending out of the police department to a civilian agency and adding community ambassadors to the NYPD to serve as liaisons between officers and New Yorkers.“People did not protest for the sake of protest. They protest to achieve change, and now we must deliver that change,” de Blasio said.",
    "Lawyers for the four police are taking a ‘blame the victim’ approach, which experts say can be effective in trial.A lawyer for one of the four former Minneapolis officers charged in George Floyd’s death is highlighting the latter’s past crimes and history of drug use, calling him an ex-con and “evident danger to the community”.Another is seizing on Floyd’s medical issues and addiction, saying he likely died from fentanyl, not a knee on his neck.Some court filings by defence lawyers in recent months are taking a blame-the-victim approach. It is a common defence strategy that legal experts say will be used to show officers acted reasonably, and to counter widely seen bystander video showing a white police officer kneeling on Floyd’s neck for nearly eight minutes.Experts say the strategy may resonate with a potential jury pool, even if much of what is said now never comes up at a trial set for next year.Don Lewis, a prominent Twin Cities lawyer who is not connected to this case, said it is usual for defence lawyers to “feed the stereotype of the dangers of a Black man” to a jury to show that any use of force by law enforcement is justified. He said only one or two jurors need to have doubts.Floyd, a Black man who was in handcuffs, died on May 25 after Derek Chauvin pressed his knee against Floyd’s neck as Floyd said he could not breathe, called out for his mother and became motionless.Chauvin is charged with second-degree murder, third-degree murder and manslaughter.Thomas Lane, J Kueng and Tou Thao are charged with aiding and abetting both second-degree murder and manslaughter.Bystander video of Floyd’s arrest circulated around the world, sparking protests and leading to increased support for the Black Lives Matter movement.Mike Brandt, a defence lawyer not connected to the case, said countering that video with Floyd’s past is a good strategy.“You are trying to push the pendulum back … from those damning videos of Chauvin with his knee on Floyd’s neck,” he said.The former officers are expected in court on Friday for a hearing on several issues, including a prosecution request to try the men together and defence requests to move the trial away from Minneapolis. Defence requests to dismiss charges will not be addressed at the hearing.In documents requesting dismissal, Lane’s lawyer, Earl Gray, wrote about Floyd’s prior charges of armed robbery and drug possession in Texas. He called Floyd an ex-con, a violent defendant, a liar, an addict, a drug distributor, and a danger. “Mr Floyd was, as the Officers had suspected, an addict,” Gray wrote. “He was worse than that.”Ben Crump, a lawyer for Floyd’s family, rejected that approach.“Everything you need to know is on that horrific video,” Crump said. “When police do inexcusable things, the defence is always to kill the victim all over again by dredging up their history and assassinating their character.”The Texas robbery is unlikely to come up at trial because it would not be relevant unless the officers had prior knowledge of it.Kelly Keegan, another lawyer not connected to the case, said prior incidents cannot be brought up in court just to smear people, and a judge must weigh whether the information will help the jury find facts or just leave a negative impression.One past arrest that could come up at trial is a May 2019 incident in which defence lawyers say Floyd acted in a similar way.Body-camera footage from the day Floyd died shows Lane and Kueng approaching a panicked Floyd, who says, “I’m not a bad guy!” and struggles, begging not to be put in a squad car. Gray wrote that the video shows Floyd had something in his mouth that looked like a fentanyl pill, which disappeared. Autopsy reports show Floyd had fentanyl in his system.Gray and Eric Nelson, Chauvin’s lawyer, wrote that during a May 2019 arrest, Floyd would not listen to officers’ commands, put something in his mouth, had to be physically removed from a vehicle, then began to cry. In that case, several opioid pills were found, along with cocaine, they wrote.Nelson compared Floyd’s behaviour in both arrests, saying: “Clearly, Mr Floyd had a modus operandi in the way he acted when approached by police officers while attempting to conceal narcotics.”Keegan said even if the officers had no knowledge of the 2019 arrest, defence lawyers could argue Floyd had a habit of swallowing drugs, acting scared, crying and struggling when approached by police.Gray wrote that Floyd shares blame for his death.“All he had to do is sit in the police car, like every other defendant who is initially arrested,” Gray wrote. “While attempting to avoid his arrest, all by himself, Mr Floyd overdosed on Fentanyl. Given his intoxication level, breathing would have been difficult at best. Mr Floyd’s intentional failure to obey commands, coupled with his overdosing, contributed to his own death.”Nelson also honed in on Floyd’s past drug use, writing that bringing up Floyd’s history of drug addiction is “not an attempt to assail Mr Floyd’s character”. But, he said, Floyd most likely died of “fentanyl or a combination of fentanyl and methamphetamine in concert with his underlying health conditions”.The county medical examiner classified Floyd’s death as a homicide, with his heart stopping while he was restrained by police and his neck compressed. A summary report listed fentanyl intoxication and recent methamphetamine use under “other significant conditions” but not under “cause of death”.According to prosecutors’ notes, Hennepin County Medical Examiner Andrew Baker told prosecutors that absent other apparent causes of death, it “could be acceptable” to rule the death an overdose, based on the level of fentanyl in Floyd’s system.A separate autopsy commissioned for Floyd’s family concluded he died of asphyxiation due to neck and back compression.Lewis and Keegan said Floyd’s cause of death will be up to a jury. They said it would be tough to eliminate all biases from a potential jury, and questions asked during jury selection will be important.While a blame-the-victim approach might seem questionable to some, Lewis said a defence lawyer’s job “is not to foster racial harmony or to further criminal justice reform. His job is solely to get his client acquitted.”",
    "Lawyers seek an amount to be determined by a jury, hope it will be so costly as to stop future killings by police.George Floyd’s family has filed a lawsuit against the city of Minneapolis and the four police officers charged in his death, alleging the officers violated Floyd’s rights when they restrained him and the city allowed a culture of excessive force, racism and impunity to flourish in its police force.Wednesday’s lawsuit seeks compensatory and special damages in an amount to be determined by a jury. The complaint also asks for a receiver to be appointed to ensure the city properly trains and supervises its police officers in the future.“We seek to set a precedence to make it financially prohibitive that the police won’t wrongfully kill marginalised people, especially Black people in the future,” lawyer Benjamin Crump said at a news conference announcing the lawsuit. The complaint, emailed to Al Jazeera by Crump’s office, alleges the Minneapolis Police Department is at fault for Floyd’s death, due to its ratification of “the culture of systemic racism and disparate treatment of the Black Community”, vague and “unconstitutional” use of force policies and “Killology” training that “teaches officers to consider every person and every situation as a potential deadly threat and to kill ‘less hesitantly'”.The pursuit to get #JusticeForGeorgeFloyd continues! On behalf George’s family, we're announcing a civil lawsuit against the City of Minneapolis and police officers today at 1PM ET / 12PM CT. Watch the news conference virtually: https://t.co/7hqmTWN28b— Ben Crump (@AttorneyCrump) July 15, 2020Crump said in a statement that accompanied the complaint: “The City of Minneapolis has a history of policies, procedures and deliberate indifference that violates the rights of arrestees, particularly Black men, and highlights the need for officer training and discipline.”Floyd, a Black man who was handcuffed, died on May 25 after Derek Chauvin, a white police officer, pressed his knee against Floyd’s neck for nearly nine minutes as Floyd said he could not breathe.Chauvin has been charged with second-degree murder, third-degree murder and manslaughter. Three other officers at the scene – Tou Thao, Thomas Lane and J Kueng – have been charged with aiding and abetting both second-degree murder and manslaughter.All four officers were fired the day after Floyd’s death, which set off protests that spread around the world and turned into a national reckoning on race in the US.Floyd’s death also sparked calls to abolish the Minneapolis Police Department and replace it with a new public safety department. A majority of City Council members support the move, saying the department has a long history and culture of brutality that has resisted change.A public hearing was planned later on Wednesday on the proposal, which requires a change in the city’s charter that could go to voters in November.The lawsuit came on the same day a court allowed public viewing by appointment of video footage from the body cameras of Lane and Kueng.A coalition of news organisations and attorneys for Lane and Kueng has been advocating to make the videos public, saying they would provide a more complete picture of what happened when Floyd was taken into custody. The judge hasn’t said why he’s not allowing the video to be disseminated more widely.According to documents in state probate court, Floyd is survived by 11 known heirs, including five children and six siblings. They live in Texas, North Carolina, Florida and New York. All but one of Floyd’s children are adults. He has no living parents or grandparents.The families of victims of other high-profile police shootings have received high payouts in Minnesota.Last year, Minneapolis agreed to pay $20m to the family of Justine Ruszczyk Damond, an unarmed woman who was shot by an officer after she called 911 to report hearing a possible crime happening behind her home.The settlement came three days after the officer, Mohamed Noor, was convicted of murdering her and is believed to be the largest payout ever stemming from police violence in Minnesota.At the time, Mayor Jacob Frey cited Noor’s unprecedented conviction and his failure to identify a threat before he used deadly force as reasons for the large settlement.The mother of Philando Castile, a Black motorist killed by an officer in 2016, reached a nearly $3m settlement with the suburb of St Anthony, which employed the officer.The officer, Jeronimo Yanez, was acquitted of manslaughter and other charges.",
    "US national security adviser O’Brien accused Zimbabwe and China of stirring unrest in US over George Floyd’s death.Zimbabwe has summoned the ambassador of the United States to the country over remarks by a senior US official accusing it of stirring anti-racism protests following the death of George Floyd in police custody.In an interview with ABC news on Sunday, US national security adviser Robert O’Brien referred to Zimbabwe and China as “foreign adversaries” using social media to stoke unrest and “sow discord”, without citing any evidence.Zimbabwe’s foreign ministry spokesman James Manzou said US Ambassador Brian Nichols was called in to explain O’Brien’s remarks on Monday.  The United States has been rocked by days of sometimes violent protests after Floyd, an unarmed African American, died in Minneapolis, Minnesota, while a white police officer knelt on his neck, ignoring complaints he could not breathe.US President Donald Trump’s administration has portrayed the violence as the work of outside groups. Officials are investigating whether foreign adversaries are behind a burgeoning disinformation campaign on social media.  Statement by Ambassador Nichols on his Meeting with Foreign Minister Moyo pic.twitter.com/SmcphOCxoD— U.S. Embassy Harare (@usembassyharare) June 1, 2020Government spokesman Nick Mangwana said Zimbabwe did not consider itself “America’s adversary”.  “We prefer having friends and allies to having unhelpful adversity with any other nation including the USA,” Mangwana said in a Twitter post on Sunday.  Zimbabwe-US relations have been tense since Washington imposed sanctions on former president Robert Mugabe and members of his inner circle in 2002 over rights abuses.Those sanctions were extended in March of this year, with Washington citing President Emmerson Mnangagwa’s failure to implement reforms as well as his violent crackdowns on opposition since he took power in 2017.Mnangagwa, Mugabe’s successor, is one of the more than 80 Zimbabweans who are sanctioned by the US government, which prevents them from having US bank accounts and traveling to the US.",
    "The Trump administration has already arrested more than 300 protesters since the death of George Floyd.In a private call with federal prosecutors across the country, Attorney General William Barr’s message was clear: Aggressively go after demonstrators who cause violence.Barr pushed his US attorneys to bring federal charges whenever they could, keeping a grip on cases even if a defendant could be tried instead in state court, according to officials with knowledge of last week’s call who were not authorised to publicly discuss the matter and spoke on condition of anonymity. Federal convictions often result in longer prison sentences.The Trump administration’s crackdown has already led to more than 300 arrests on federal crimes in the protests since the death of George Floyd. An AP analysis of the data shows that while many people are accused of violent crimes such as arson for hurling Molotov cocktails and burning police cars and assault for injuring law enforcement, others are not. That has led to criticism that at least some arrests are a politically motivated effort to stymie demonstrations.“The speed at which this whole thing was moved from state court to federal court is stunning and unbelievable,” said Charles Sunwabe, who represents an Erie, Pennsylvania, man accused of lighting a fire at a coffee shop after a May 30 protest. “It’s an attempt to intimidate these demonstrators and to silence them,” he said.Some cases are viewed as trumped up and should not be in federal court, lawyers say, including a teenager accused of civil disorder for claiming online “we are not each other’s enemy, only enemy is 12”, a reference to law enforcement.The administration has seized on the demonstrations and an aggressive federal response to showcase what President Donald Trump says is his law-and-order prowess, claiming he is countering rising crime in cities run by Democrats. Trump has derided protesters and played up the violence around protests, though the majority of them are peaceful.Pockets of violence have indeed popped up in cities, including Portland, Oregon, where protests devolved into clashes with law enforcement for weeks on end. Nights of looting and other unrest have occurred elsewhere: Rochester, New York; Minneapolis, Louisville, Washington, DC, and Chicago.Federal officials were called to Kenosha, Wisconsin, after large protests and unrest following the shooting of Jacob Blake and the gunning down of two protesters and the later arrest of a 17-year-old in their deaths. Notably, that teenager has not been charged with any federal crimes. Neither was a man accused of shooting and killing a demonstrator in Louisville following the death of Breonna Taylor.While Barr has gone after protest-related violence targeted at law enforcement, he has argued there is seldom a reason to open sweeping investigations into the practices of police departments. The Justice Department, however, has initiated a number of civil rights investigations into individual cases. Barr has said he does not believe there is systemic racism in police departments, even though Black people are disproportionately more likely to be killed by police, and public attitudes over police reforms have shifted.During the call with US attorneys, Barr raised the prospect that prosecutors could bring a number of other potential charges in unrest cases, including the rarely used sedition statute, according to the officials familiar with the call. Legal experts cautioned the use of that statute is unlikely, given its difficulty to prove in court.Federal involvement in local cases is nothing new. Officials across the country have turned to the Justice Department for decades, particularly for violent crime and gang cases where offenders could face much stiffer federal penalties and there is no parole.Police chiefs in several cities have pointed to the importance of their relationships with federal prosecutors to bring charges that can result in long prison sentences to drive down violent crime.Even before the unrest earlier this year, the Justice Department was stepping in to bring charges in states where the government believes justice is not being fully pursued by local prosecutors. In January, for example, the department brought federal hate crime charges against a woman accused of slapping three Orthodox Jewish women in one of several apparently anti-Semitic attacks reported throughout New York during Hanukkah.It is not clear whether protest-related arrests will continue apace. Demonstrations have slowed, though not necessarily because of the federal charges. Wildfires in the West and hurricanes in the South have lessened some of the conflict.While many local prosecutors have dismissed dozens of low-level protest arrests, some are still coming down hard. A Pennsylvania judge set bail at $1m for about a dozen people in a protest that followed the death of a knife-wielding man by police.Even some Democrats, including District of Columbia Mayor Muriel Bowser, have called for the Justice Department to pursue federal charges against violent demonstrators, going as far as accusing the administration of declining to prosecute rioters. Washington’s Metropolitan Police Department had arrested 42 people one August weekend after a protest left a trail of vandalism. But prosecutors said the arrest paperwork did not identify specific crimes tied to each suspect.The federal confrontation with Bowser seemed counterintuitive, though Trump has a history of squaring off against the mayor.About one-third of the federal protest-related cases are in Portland, for crimes such as assaulting a deputy US marshal with a baseball bat, setting fires and setting off explosives at the federal court and throwing rocks at officers.Three purported “Boogaloo” members, who use the loose movement’s name as a slang term for a second civil war or collapse of civilization, were charged with possessing a homemade bomb and inciting a riot in Las Vegas.An El Paso, Texas, man was accused of promoting hate speech, posting a video online with a racist epithet and making threatening comments to Black Lives Matter protesters while holding a military-style rifle at his feet. A Minnesota man was accused of helping burn down a police precinct headquarters there after Floyd’s death.But other cases simply do not belong in federal court, lawyers say.In Seattle, 35-year-old Isaiah Willoughby, who is accused of setting fire to the outside of a police precinct, faces a mandatory minimum of five years in prison if convicted of arson in federal court. He could be looking at about a year behind bars in state court, where his lawyer said the case belongs.“This is city property that has been destroyed and you have a local prosecutors office that is ready and willing and able to charge these cases in state court, but the federal government is attempting to emphasize these protest-related crimes for whatever agenda they are seeking to pursue,” said assistant federal public defender Dennis Carroll.Carroll accused federal authorities of using the cases to try to make the protests seem more violent and disruptive than they really were.Federal prosecutors this month agreed to dismiss the charge against a man who authorities said was found with a Molotov cocktail in his backpack after he and other protesters were arrested in May for blocking traffic in Jacksonville, Florida. Video showed that 27-year-old Ivan Zecher was wrongfully arrested because he was actually on the sidewalk – not in the street – meaning prosecutors could not pursue their case, Zecher’s attorney, Marcus Barnett said.“There is absolutely an agenda here to blow these out of proportion, make these look more serious or more sinister than it is,” Barnett said of the pursuit of federal charges. “This is the Justice Department, from the top, furthering an agenda that has nothing to do with justice.”",
    "Nearly 62,000 American reserve soldiers activated in two dozen states to potentially confront violent protests.Tensions spiked outside the White House on Sunday, the scene of days of demonstrations amid unrest across the United States against police killings of black people.The entire Washington, DC National Guard – roughly 1,700 soldiers – was called in to help control the protests. The city of Boston also deployed troops on its streets.Tens of thousands of reserve soldiers have been put at the ready across the United States.“As of Sunday, National Guard Soldiers and Airmen were activated in 24 states and the District of Columbia in response to civil disturbances, bringing the total number of Guard members on duty in support of their governors to nearly 62,000,” the guard announced in a statement.“State and local law enforcement agencies remain responsible for security. The National Guard personnel assigned to these missions are trained, equipped and prepared to assist law enforcement authorities with protecting lives and property of citizens in their state.”With cities wounded by days of violent unrest, the United States headed into a new week with neighbourhoods in shambles, urban streets on lockdown and shaken confidence about when leaders would find the answers to control the mayhem amid unrelenting raw emotion over police killings of black people.Sunday capped a tumultuous weekend and month that saw city and state officials deploy thousands of National Guard soldiers, enact strict curfews and shut down mass transit systems. Even with those efforts, many demonstrations erupted into violence as protesters hurled rocks and Molotov cocktails at police in Philadelphia, set a fire near the White House and were hit with tear gas and pepper spray in Austin and several other cities. Seven Boston police officers were hospitalised.In some cities, thieves smashed their way into stores and ran off with as much as they could carry, leaving shop owners – many of them just ramping up their business again after coronavirus pandemic lockdowns – to clean up their shattered storefronts.In others, police tried to calm tensions by kneeling in solidarity with demonstrators, while still maintaining a strong presence for security.At least 4,400 people have been arrested over days of protests, according to a tally compiled by The Associated Press. Arrests ranged from stealing and blocking highways to breaking curfew.The demonstrations were sparked by the death of George Floyd, a black man who pleaded for air as an officer pressed a knee into his neck.Floyd’s death in Minneapolis came after tensions had already flared after two white men were arrested in May for the February shooting death of black jogger Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia, and the Louisville police shooting death of Breonna Taylor in her home in March, which also attracted national attention in May.“They keep killing our people. I’m so sick and tired of it,” said Mahira Louis, 15, who was at a Boston protest with her mother on Sunday, leading chants of “George Floyd, say his name“.Tensions rose on Sunday outside the White House, the scene of three days of demonstrations, where police fired tear gas and stun grenades into a crowd of more than 1,000 chanting protesters across the street in Lafayette Park.The crowd ran, piling up road signs and plastic barriers to light a raging fire in a nearby street. Some pulled an American flag from a building and threw it into the blaze.A building in the park with toilets and a maintenance office went up in flames. As demonstrations persisted past curfew, Washington police said they were responding to multiple fires lit around the capital.",
    "Medical examiner’s finding on homicide confirms same conclusion of the private autopsy, but differs in part on cause.A medical examiner’s office on Monday ruled that the death of George Floyd, the Black man whose killing in Minneapolis, Minnesota, police custody last week triggered nationwide protests, was a homicide and that he died from asphyxiation.The medical examiner’s finding that the death was a homicide confirms the same conclusion of the independent autopsy that was also released on Monday, but there are key differences over the cause.A news release from the Hennepin County Medical Examiner said that Floyd, who struggled to breathe as an officer pinned him down by kneeling on his neck, had “recent methamphetamine use” and “fentanyl intoxication” – along with hypertension and coronary artery disease – all of which were possible contributing factors to his death.But two doctors who carried out that independent autopsy of Floyd, 46, and two lawyers for the family said that he had no underlying health conditions that may have contributed to his death. They argued that not only the officer who was kneeing Floyd’s neck killed him, but also two officers who were pressing their weight onto Floyd’s back while he was on the ground.They added that they did not have information on toxicology and any drug or alcohol use by Floyd.Dr Allecia Wilson of the University of Michigan, one of the two forensic doctors who performed the independent autopsy, said the evidence pointed to homicide by “mechanical asphyxia” meaning from some physical force that interfered with oxygen supply.While the county’s full autopsy report has not yet been released, Monday’s news release appeared to show authorities walked back their conclusions on what killed Floyd.The original criminal complaint against the police officer who pinned Floyd with his knee cited the medical examiner’s office when it said it found no findings of strangulation.Carolyn Marinan, a spokeswoman for Hennepin County, did not confirm any reversal, saying only that Monday’s news release was the “final findings”.Bystander video showed Floyd pleading to be let up and repeatedly saying that he could not breathe as police officer Derek Chauvin pinned Floyd to the ground for nearly nine minutes. Two other officers applied pressure with their knees to Floyd’s back.Chauvin, who is white and has been fired from the Minneapolis police department, was hit with third-degree murder and manslaughter charges last week.But Dr Michael Baden, who took part in the independent autopsy at the behest of Floyd’s family, said that the two other officers’ actions also caused Floyd to stop breathing.“We can see after a little bit less than four minutes that Mr Floyd is motionless, lifeless,” Baden said, adding he found no underlying health conditions in Floyd that caused his death.Baden has worked on several high-profile cases, including the 2014 death of Eric Garner, a Black man who died after being choked by police in New York City.Baden countered the argument that if Floyd could speak, then he could breathe.“Many police are under the impression that if you can talk, that means you’re breathing. That is not true,” Baden said. “I am talking right now in front of you and not taking a breath.”Antonio Romanucci and Ben Crump, the attorneys representing the Floyd family, said all four officers at the scene should be facing charges, not just Chauvin.Crump added the independent autopsy and video evidence make it clear that Floyd was dead while he was still lying on the street with police atop him.“That ambulance was his hearse,” he said.Crump said the Floyd family wants to see charge lodged against all four officers who were at the scene – and for Chauvin, who pressed his knee into Floyd’s neck, to be facing first-degree murder charges.But they are also seeking an end to the violent protests that have beset the United States.“George died because he needed a breath, a breath of air,” Crump said. “I implore you all to join his family in taking a breath – taking a breath for justice, taking a breath for peace.”",
    "Defence lawyer for Minneapolis police officer accused of aiding and abetting Floyd’s murder seeks dismissal of US case.A lawyer for one of four Minneapolis police officers charged in the death of George Floyd is asking to have his client’s case dismissed, saying there is not probable cause to charge him based on all of the evidence in the United States case and the law.In court filings (PDF) made public on Wednesday, Thomas Lane’s lawyer, Earl Gray, painted an image of a rookie officer who trusted his senior officer after Floyd had been acting erratically, struggling and hurting himself. Gray said Lane had asked twice if officers should roll Floyd on his side, and the senior officer – Derek Chauvin – said no.As part of his court filing, Gray filed transcripts from body camera footage recorded by Lane’s camera and the camera of his partner, J Alexander Kueng, as well as a transcript of Lane’s interview with state investigators. Gray wrote that all of the evidence exonerates his client and that it is not “fair or reasonable” for Lane to stand trial.Floyd, a Black man, died May 25 after Chauvin, a white officer, pressed his knee into Floyd’s neck for nearly nine minutes and held it there even after Floyd said he couldn’t breathe and stopped moving.Chauvin is charged with second-degree murder, third-degree murder and manslaughter. Lane, Kueng and Tou Thao are charged with aiding and abetting both second-degree murder and manslaughter. Lane was holding Floyd’s legs at the time, Kueng was at Floyd’s midsection and Thao was watching nearby bystanders. All four officers were fired.Gray said in his court filing (PDF) that his client’s body camera video shows a complete view of how the encounter with Floyd went from the time Lane got on the scene to the point where Floyd was put into an ambulance; Lane went in the ambulance and helped with CPR.Gray said that from the start, Lane demanded to see Floyd’s hands at least 10 times while Floyd was in his car, and Lane told investigators he drew his gun because Floyd was reaching for something, but then holstered it once Floyd showed his hands. Gray said Floyd was acting erratically and had foam at his mouth.Lane and Kueng struggled to get Floyd into the squad car, and Floyd told the officers “I can’t breathe” and “I want to lay on the ground”.Gray wrote that Floyd started to thrash back and forth and was “hitting his face on the glass in the squad and began to bleed from his mouth”. Officers brought Floyd to the ground and, “The plan was to restrain him so he couldn’t move and hurt himself anymore,” Gray wrote.As Floyd yelled out, Lane told the other officers “he’s got to be on something” and he asked twice whether officers should roll Floyd onto his side, and Chauvin said no.“Lane had no basis to believe Chauvin was wrong in making that decision,” Gray wrote.Lane told state investigators that Chauvin was not Lane’s field training officer, but he was an officer that Lane had previously gone to for guidance.Gray also argued that in order to charge Lane with aiding and abetting, prosecutors must show Lane played a knowing role in committing a crime. He said there’s no evidence Lane played an intentional role or knew Chauvin was committing a crime.“The decision to restrain Floyd was reasonably justified,” Gray wrote, adding: “Based on Floyd’s actions up to this point, the officers had no idea what he would do next – hurt himself, hurt the officers, flee, or anything else, but he was not cooperating.”Gray wrote that Lane’s trust in Chauvin was “reasonable and not criminal”.",
    "Former Minneapolis police officer Thomas Lane has been freed from jail on $750,000 bail, sheriff’s office records show.The police killing of George Floyd has triggered anti-racism protests around the world. A number of monuments with links to colonialism and slavery have been defaced or pulled down in Europe and the United States as protests for racial justice continue.Floyd’s brother, Philonise Floyd, has testified before the House of Representatives Judiciary Committee, along with family lawyer Ben Crump and 10 others at the first congressional hearing to examine the social and political undercurrents that have fuelled weeks of protests nationwide and overseas.Floyd died on May 25 after a policeman knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes. His death sparked nationwide calls for policing reforms.Spurred on by the anti-racism protests in the United States, Dalits – a marginalised community once referred to as “untouchables” – have called on India to acknowledge centuries of oppression they have endured.Dalits find themselves outside the Hindu caste hierarchy – a membership determined at birth – and have historically faced violence, segregation and been barred from even having their shadows touch those of people from more privileged castes.Read more here.Volunteers on the scene in the nation’s capital are working to gather and preserve hundreds of items that were posted during days of protests over the death of George Floyd in police hands in Minnesota.Hundreds of signs and posters that had been on the fence enclosing Lafayette Square near the White House have been moved across the street and taped to the walls of a construction site, or strung together and hung from trees lining the street.DC Mayor Muriel Bowser and the Smithsonian have expressed an interest in preserving the artefacts.A statue of a 17th-century slave trader that was toppled by anti-racism protesters in Bristol, England, has been fished out of the harbour by city authorities.Bristol City Council says the bronze statue of Edward Colston was recovered to avoid drawing a crowd. The council says it has been taken to a “secure location” and will end up in a museum.Colston built a fortune transporting enslaved Africans across the Atlantic and left most of his money to charity. His name adorns streets and buildings in Bristol, which was once the UK’s biggest port for slave ships.Although many Americans recognise the immorality of historic colonialists, slave owners and anti-abolitionists, some say these symbols should be preserved as a reminder of the country’s past.The New York Knicks and James Dolan, the executive chairman of the team’s parent company, The Madison Square Garden Company, issued a statement about the death of George Floyd after coming under fire for their delayed response to the incident.While most NBA organisations were quick to issue public responses, the American professional basketball team based in the New York City borough of Manhattan, only issued a statement 15 days after Floyd’s death.Posting a statement on its social media accounts, the Knicks said: “Every one of us has a role to play in creating a more just and equal society, where there is no racism, bigotry, violence or hate. We stand with all who act for positive change.”pic.twitter.com/q1Ui8N29ai— NEW YORK KNICKS (@nyknicks) June 9, 2020At least seven Los Angeles police officers were removed from their field duties for using excessive force during recent protests, the police department told CNN.The move comes as police across the US have come under attack for the use of violence in response to demonstrators protesting against police brutality.Critics have pointed to the use of tear gas, rubber bullets, and physical attacks as examples of excessive use of force.The Australian police have warned people not to attend a Black Lives Matter protest rally in Sydney on Friday unless they want to risk being arrested.Mick Willing, New South Wales’s assistant police commissioner, said the event is unauthorised because the organisers did not notify the police in advance.The police would deploy “significant resources” to enforce COVID-19 restriction orders. People could face arrest if they choose to attend the event, Willing told reporters.A local authority in southern England said it would remove a statue of Robert Baden-Powell, the latest memorial to be taken down in the wake of anti-racism protests sparked by the death of George Floyd.While Baden-Powell was hailed as far-sighted for setting up the scouts, critics said he held racist views and was a supporter of Adolf Hitler and fascism.Poole council said the statue of Baden-Powell would now be moved from its location on the quayside of the seaside town where it has been for just over a decade to safe storage while there were discussions with local communities about its future.“Whilst famed for the creation of the Scouts, we also recognise that there are some aspects of Robert Baden-Powell’s life that are considered less worthy of commemoration,” council leader Vikki Slade said.Protesters in Portsmouth, Virginia, beheaded and then pulled down four statues that were part of a Confederate monument, the Virginian-Pilot newspaper reported.As the statues fell, a protester was hit on the head, causing him to lose consciousness. He was then taken to hospital.All four have been beheaded tonight pic.twitter.com/uMRKFziPYb— Saleen Martin (@Saleen_Martin) June 11, 2020The toppled monument sits at a site where slaves were punished on a whipping post, according to the Virginian-Pilot, and efforts to tear one of the statues down began around 8:20pm, but the rope protesters were using snapped.They then started to dismantle the monument one piece at a time as a marching band played in the streets and other protesters danced.A statue of Confederate President Jefferson Davis was torn down along Richmond’s famed Monument Avenue on Wednesday night by protesters.The statue in the former capital of the Confederacy was toppled shortly before 11pm and was on the ground in the middle of an intersection, news outlets reported. Richmond police were on the scene.BREAKING: The Jefferson Davis statue on Monument Ave. has been pulled down tonight, this video is from a person in the area who tells me police are now on scene. @8NEWS (Explicit language warning) pic.twitter.com/maZ2YxklLk— Nick Conigliaro (@NConigliaroNews) June 11, 2020Virginia Governor Ralph Northam last week ordered the removal of an iconic statue of Confederate General Robert E Lee, which is four blocks away from where the Davis statue stood. A judge on Monday issued an injunction preventing officials from removing the monuments for the next 10 days.Jay Inslee, the governor of Washington state, has ordered an independent investigation into the death of a Black man who died while in the custody of Tacoma police.The move comes after new information emerged this week that at least one sheriff’s deputy and a state trooper were at the scene when the man, Manuel Ellis, was detained and died on March 3. In a nearly nine-minute clip released by the lawyer representing Ellis’s family, the 33-year-old man is heard crying out “I can’t breathe, sir” while handcuffed.The medical examiner ruled the death a homicide.The Pierce County Sheriff’s Department had been close to finishing an investigation, and a briefing with the prosecuting attorney was scheduled for Wednesday. Inslee said he ordered a new probe to make sure that the work is “done free of conflicts of interest” as officers from the sheriff’s department were present at the scene.The police department has identified the four officers involved in restraining Ellis. They were put on administrative leave last week after the autopsy results were made public.Tacoma Mayor Victoria Woodards and the victim’s family have called for those officers to be fired and arrested.Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential candidate, acknowledged concerns about his support for a 1994 crime bill that critics say contributed to the mass incarceration of racial minorities in recent decades.Speaking during a National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) town hall event on systemic racism, Biden said questions about his role in writing the bill are “legitimate”. But he insisted that people should judge him based on his current actions, not his past.He said that while he has been “told all along” that young people oppose his past stances on criminal justice issues, “there is no polling evidence to sustain that. Nor is there voting evidence thus far to sustain that”.“Watch what I do. Judge me based on what I do, what I say and to whom I say it,” he added.The co-owners of a family-owned Missouri newspaper resigned from their positions in protest after the publication of a racist syndicated cartoon that depicted a Black man stealing a handbag from a white woman while hailing funding cuts to police.The cartoon published in the Washington Missourian on Wednesday shows a white woman asking for someone to call 911, but the masked Black man says, “Good luck with that, lady … we defunded the police.”Washington Missourian owners and sisters Susan Miller and Jeanne Miller Wood said in an apology that the newspaper’s publisher – their father – made the decision to run the cartoon and did not let them know in advance.“As co-owners we believe it was racist and in no circumstance should have been published,” they wrote of the cartoon. “We apologize to our readers and our staff for the obvious pain and offense it caused. For the record, we abhor the sentiment and denounce ANY form of racism.”Thomas Lane, one of four police officers charged in Floyd’s death, posted bail of $750,000 and was released from the Hennepin County Jail, with conditions, shortly after 4pm on Wednesday.The other officers remain in custody.Lane, 37, is charged with aiding and abetting both second-degree murder and manslaughter for his role in the arrest of Floyd, after another officer, Derek Chauvin, pressed his knee to the unarmed Black man’s neck.Lane’s lawyer said last week that Lane was a rookie, and that the only thing he did was hold Floyd’s feet so he could not kick. The criminal complaint also says that Lane expressed concern about Floyd and asked Chauvin twice if they should roll Floyd to his side, but Chauvin said no. Buffalo will replace its police Emergency Response Team with a new “public protection unit” following the suspension and arrest of two ERT members seen on video shoving a 75-year-old protester who fell and cracked his head, Mayor Byron Brown said.The city will also halt arrests for low-level, non-violent offences like marijuana possession and make it easier for the public to view police body camera video under measures Brown introduced as “a critical first step” in making Buffalo more inclusive and equitable. “We will shift policing in Buffalo away from enforcement and to a restorative model that promotes stronger community bonds, civic engagement and an end to young Black men, Black people, being caught in a cycle of crime and incarceration by consciously limiting their negative engagement with police,” Brown said at a news conference.Speaking at a virtual NAACP town hall on systemic racism, Biden backed calls for reforms in US policing methods“This is an inflection moment in American history, a moment where we must make substantive changes now, changes the American police as the police is long overdue,” the presumptive Democratic presidential candidate said.There is systemic racism not just in our law enforcement but also in housing, education, and everything we do — and we have to do the hard work to end it. pic.twitter.com/w9H77Jbuqa— Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) June 11, 2020Biden highlighted his proposals for additional community policing funds. But still, he avoided a major flashpoint in the conversation around such reforms – whether he would support reparations for African Americans.Pressed multiple times on his stance, Biden said only that a study should be done and that his support for cash reparations “would depend on what it was and if it will include Native Americans as well”.Amazon banned police use of its facial-recognition technology for a year, making it the latest tech giant to step back from law-enforcement use of systems that have faced criticism for incorrectly identifying people with darker skin.The Seattle-based company did not say why it took action now.Civil rights groups and Amazon’s own employees have pushed the company to stop selling its technology, called Rekognition, to government agencies, saying that it could be used to invade people’s privacy and target minorities.In a blog post on Wednesday, Amazon said that it hoped Congress would put in place stronger regulations for facial recognition.A group of protesters pulled down a statue of Italian explorer Christopher Columbus in Saint Paul, Minnesota, the latest US monument to be torn down amid nationwide demonstrations against police brutality and racial inequalities.The 10-foot bronze statue was pulled from its granite base by several dozen people led by a Minnesota-based Native American activist, Mike Forcia, outside the state Capitol.“It was the right thing to do and it was the right time to do it,” Forcia told Reuters news agency, in apparent reference to more than two weeks of protests over the police killing of Floyd, an unarmed Black man. Native American activists have long objected to honouring Columbus, saying that his expeditions to the Americas led to the colonisation and genocide of their ancestors.Australian police are warning those that attend public rallies in support of Black Lives Matter risk fines and arrest if they breach social distancing restrictions, as politicians warn the events risk spreading the disease.Tens of thousands attended rallies last weekend, and more protests are planned on Friday.“We will start writing tickets of 1,000 Australian dollars ($700), and we can use all our powers to move people on,” New South Wales Police Commissioner Mick Fuller told local radio station 2GB Radio. “If you don’t move on, you’ll be arrested.”The Black Lives Matter movement has refocused attention on Australia’s treatment of its Indigenous people and the high number of Aboriginal deaths in custody.The US Soccer Federation says it has repealed a 2017 requirement that all players stand during the national anthem.The sport’s governing body introduced the policy after Megan Rapinoe, a member of the US women’s team took a knee before a match in 2016 to show her solidarity with American football player Colin Kaepernick who took a knee to bring attention to racial injustice.“We apologize to our players – especially our black players – staff, fans and all who support eradicating racism,” the federation said in a statement.“Sports are a powerful platform for good and we have not used our platform as effectively as we should have. We can do more on these specific issues and we will.”The Pohlad family – the owners of the Minnesota Twins baseball team – have pledged $25m for racial justice.“Black people have experienced oppression and racism for far too long in this country,” Bill Pohlad, the president of the Pohlad Family Foundation, said in a statement. “We condemn racism in all its forms, and we are firmly committed to helping enact meaningful change.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 10, 2020Boston is offering those who joined street protests following Floyd’s death access to coronavirus testing.Mayor Marty Walsh said in a news conference that his administration was reaching out to organisers of the demonstrations and is working to create a mobile pop-up testing site in a Boston neighbourhood that will be open to everyone, whether or not they are showing signs of COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus.“There is no special screening or requirements,” Walsh said. “As people lift their voices to fight racism and injustice, we want to make sure that we keep them safe, as well.”Thousands of people demonstrated in support of the Black Lives Matter movement in a park in Amsterdam named for South African anti-apartheid icon Nelson Mandela.It was the latest in a series of protests in Dutch cities that have taken place in recent days.“We are here to hold up a fist against the global pandemic of racism,” protester Mitchell Esajas told the crowd.Public debate about racism, discrimination and historical links to the slave trade have intensified in the Netherlands since Floyd’s death.A Dutch human rights organisation called on the government to appoint a coordinator to help tackle what it called “structural discrimination” in the Netherlands.The Minneapolis Police Department will withdraw from police union contract negotiations, Chief Medaria Arradondo said as he announced the first steps in what he said would be transformational reforms to the agency.Arradondo said a thorough review of the contract is planned. He said the contract needs to be restructured to provide more transparency and flexibility for true reform. The review would look at matters such as critical incident protocols, use of force and disciplinary protocols, including grievances and arbitration.He said it was debilitating for a chief when there were grounds to terminate an officer and a third-party mechanism worked to keep that person on the street.“This work must be transformational, but I must do it right,” Arradondo said of changes to the department.He also promised new research and strategies to spot and intervene with problem officers.“We will have a police department that our communities view as legitimate, trusting and working with their best interests at heart,” he said, adding that the department has to address issues of racism head-on.Legislators heard urgent pleas from George Floyd’s brother, who called for reforms and better training for police officers.“Teach them what necessary force is,” he said, “Teach them that necessary force should be used rarely, and only when life is at risk.”He also reminded the panel that police were called because his brother had allegedly used a counterfeit $20 bill.“George wasn’t hurt anyone that day. He didn’t deserve to die, over $20. I’m asking you. Is that what is that what a Black man is worth – $20? This is 2020. Enough is enough. The people watching in the streets are telling you enough is enough,” he said.The judiciary panel is preparing to shepherd a sweeping Democratic package of legislation aimed at combating police violence and racial injustice to the House floor by July 4, and is expected to hold further hearings next week to prepare the bill for a full House vote.George Floyd’s brother testified on Wednesday at a House Judiciary Committee hearing on issues of racial profiling, police brutality and lost trust between police departments and the communities they serve.“I’m tired. I’m tired of the pain I’m feeling now, and I’m tired of the pain I feel every time another Black person is killed for no reason,” Philonise Floyd said during his testimony.“I’m here today to ask you to make it stop. Stop the pain. Stop us from being tired,” Floyd said. “George’s calls for help were ignored. Please listen to the call I’m making to you now, to the calls of our family, and to the calls ringing out in the streets across the world.”“If his death ends up changing the world for the better. And I think it will. I think it has. Then he died as he lived. It is on you to make sure his death isn’t in vain,” he said.Read more here.The White House on Wednesday defended President Donald Trump’s promotion of an unsubstantiated conspiracy theory about a 75-year-old protester injured by police in Buffalo, saying it was Trump’s “prerogative” to raise questions about the incident.The protester, Martin Gugino, was shoved by police and critically injured when he approached them during a march against racism and police brutality in an incident that was captured on video and led to criminal charges against the officers involved.Trump, offering no evidence, tweeted on Tuesday that Gugino’s fall could be a “set up” with ties to the anti-fascist movement Antifa.Buffalo protester shoved by Police could be an ANTIFA provocateur. 75 year old Martin Gugino was pushed away after appearing to scan police communications in order to black out the equipment. @OANN  I watched, he fell harder than was pushed.

Masks can help, but it’s masks plus physical separation and when you get congregations like we saw with the demonstrations, like we have said – myself and other health officials – that’s taking a risk,” Fauci said. “Unfortunately, what we’re seeing now is just an example of the kinds of things we were concerned about.”Streaming service Netflix announced that it is promoting a new “Black Lives Matter” collection to US subscribers, featuring more than 45 movies, television shows and documentaries about racial injustice and the experience of Black Americans.The collection includes Da 5 Bloods, 13th, When They See Us, Mudbound, Orange Is the New Black, Dear White People, as well as Barry Jenkins’ Oscar-winning Moonlight.When we say “Black Lives Matter,” we also mean “Black storytelling matters.”With an understanding that our commitment to true, systemic change will take time – we're starting by highlighting powerful and complex narratives about the Black experience.— Netflix (@netflix) June 10, 2020“When we say ‘Black Lives Matter,’ we also mean ‘Black storytelling matters,'” Netflix said in a tweet. “With an understanding that our commitment to true, systemic change will take time – we’re starting by highlighting powerful and complex narratives about the Black experience.”One of the brothers of George Floyd is due to speak to a Democratic-led congressional panel as legislators take on the twin issues of police violence and racial injustice.Philonise Floyd, 42, will testify before the House of Representatives Judiciary Committee, along with family lawyer Ben Crump and 10 others at the first congressional hearing to examine the social and political undercurrents that have fuelled weeks of protests nationwide and overseas.The judiciary panel is preparing to shepherd a sweeping package of legislation, aimed at combating police violence and racial injustice, to the House floor by July 4, and is expected to hold further hearings next week to prepare the bill for a full House vote.Protesters in Portsmouth, Virginia, covered a Confederate monument in the city with rubbish bags and sheets, several hours after the city’s council members had a meeting to figure out ways to relocate it.A white sheet that read “BLM” – the acronym for Black Lives Matter – covered the fence in front of the monument hours after the Portsmouth city council met to discuss who owns the figure, a local TV channel reported. The question about who owns the monument has been the main roadblock in the city’s years-long quest to remove it.In Richmond, Virginia, a statue of Christopher Columbus was torn down by protesters, set on fire and then thrown into a lake on Tuesday. The statue was toppled less than two hours after protesters gathered in the city’s Byrd Park chanted for the statue to be taken down, news outlets reported.A white man seen in a video circulating on social media mocking George Floyd’s death included a corrections officer in South Jersey, local media reported.The man – whose identity has not been verified – was filmed kneeling on another man, recreating how Floyd died on May 25, while Black Lives Matter protesters marched by.The New Jersey Department of Corrections confirmed in a statement that the man in the video was a corrections officer at Bayside State Prison and that he has been suspended while the agency conducts an investigation.“We have been made aware that one of our officers from Bayside State Prison participated in the filming of a hateful and disappointing video that mocked the killing of George Floyd,” an NJ Department of Corrections statement said. Catch up on Tuesday’s updates here.",
    "The bloc’s top diplomat warns against further excessive use of force as Trump vows to end unrest.Latest updates:Peaceful demonstrations in the United States against the “shocking” killing of George Floyd during an arrest by police are “more than legitimate”, Germany’s foreign minister said.“The peaceful protests that we see in the US… are understandable and more than legitimate. I hope that these peaceful protests won’t slide further into violence, but even more than that I hope that they will make a difference in the United States,” Heiko Maas told reporters.Demonstrators from Australia to Europe identified with the cause of US protests and urged their own governments to address racism and police violence.Opponents of the United States’s foreign policy under President Donald Trump, meanwhile, took the opportunity to pour scorn on the violence that has engulfed the country after the killing of George Floyd.China’s foreign ministry spokesperson called out US racism as “a chronic disease of American society”. Read more here.An independent autopsy that found George Floyd died solely from asphyxiation could actually bolster the defence of the former Minneapolis police officer charged with killing him, legal experts said.The autopsy report released on Monday said Floyd’s death was a homicide and that he had no underlying medical conditions.Later on Monday, the Hennepin County Medical Examiner released details of its autopsy findings that also said Floyd’s death was a homicide caused by asphyxiation but that he had possible underlying health conditions and intoxicants in his body that may have been contributing factors in his death.“It will be part of the defence strategy to say they can’t even get the cause of death right,” Gerald Lefcourt, a criminal defence attorney, said.Paul Callan, a former New York prosecutor, said the “report created a lot of ammunition for a defence team to use in a criminal case or a subsequent civil case.”The European Union is “shocked and appalled” by the death of George Floyd in police custody, the bloc’s top diplomat said, calling it “an abuse of power” and warning against further excessive use of force.“Like the people of the United States, we are shocked and appalled by the death of George Floyd … all societies must remain vigilant against the excessive use of force,” Josep Borrell, the EU’s foreign policy chief, told reporters.Borrell called Floyd’s death a “very, very unhappy” one and said it showed “an abuse of power” by law enforcement. “We condemn racism of any kind … we trust in the ability of the Americans to come together, to heal as a nation”. A media watchdog has called on US authorities to stop targeting journalists covering protests over the death of an unarmed Black man in police custody and exempt them from curfew restrictions.In a statement published on Tuesday, the US-based Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) said that since May 29, at least 125 press freedom violations had been reported nationwide by journalists covering the demonstrations over the death of George Floyd, who died a week ago after a white police officer pinned his neck under his knee for nearly nine minutes.Read more here.The Iranian foreign ministry has called on the United States to “stop violence” against its own people in the face of large protests sweeping the nation “To the American people: the world has heard your outcry over the state of oppression.

Authorities said they were in stable condition.The bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Washington sharply criticised President Donald Trump on Monday for staging a visit to the historic St John’s Church across from the White House, where he held up a Bible after authorities had cleared the area of peaceful protesters by firing tear gas and flashbangs.The Reverend Mariann Budde, whose diocese St John’s belongs to, said she was “outraged” by Trump’s visit and noted that he did not pray while stopping by the church, a landmark known for its regular visits from sitting presidents since the early 19th century.The president also did not “acknowledge the agony and sacred worth of people of colour in our nation who rightfully demand an end to 400 years of systemic racism and white supremacy in our country”, Budde said in a statement posted to the diocese’s Twitter account after Trump’s televised visit.Statement from The Rt. Rev. Mariann Budde (@mebudde), Bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Washington (@washdio) via @thewashingtonpost (3 part thread) https://t.co/b9s6tvWsh1— The Episcopal Church (@iamepiscopalian) June 2, 2020Protesters were still in the streets of downtown Atlanta, Georgia, on Monday night as curfew neared, and police officers and the National Guard used tear gas.Protesters largely dispersed after that, though some remained, and officers were making arrests, apparently for curfew violations. A similar scene played out the night before.Late on Monday, Washington, DC, Mayor Muriel Bowser expressed that police fired on peaceful protesters to clear the way for a Trump photo-op.“I imposed a curfew at 7pm,” she tweeted. “A full 25 minutes before the curfew & w/o provocation, federal police used munitions on peaceful protestors in front of the White House, an act that will make the job of @DCPoliceDept officers more difficult. Shameful!”I imposed a curfew at 7pm. A full 25 minutes before the curfew & w/o provocation, federal police used munitions on peaceful protestors in front of the White House, an act that will make the job of @DCPoliceDept officers more difficult. Shameful!DC residents — Go home. Be safe— Muriel Bowser (@MurielBowser) June 2, 2020The fatal police shooting of the popular owner of a Louisville barbecue spot has prompted a massive march to the site where the restaurateur was killed early on Monday.David McAtee died while police officers and National Guard soldiers were enforcing a curfew amid waves of protests in the Kentucky city. Mayor Greg Fischer revealed earlier Monday that police officers lacked body camera video for the investigation.The large group marched peacefully on Monday evening as some honked horns in solidarity and marchers raised clenched fists. Louisville’s police chief was fired by the city’s mayor on Monday after the mayor learned that officers failed to activate body cameras at the chaotic scene were McAtee was shot.More than 60 National Guard troops put down their riot shields Monday evening at the request of peaceful protesters who had gathered in front of Tennessee’s state Capitol in Nashville to honour George Floyd.Guardsman had initially rushed to grab their shields and form a hard line to block the slowly moving crowd – which was singing and chanting – from advancing up the Capitol steps. As the National Guard began moving, Tennessee State Police grabbed batons and formed a line behind them. However, the crowd remained calm.Democratic legislators leaving the Capitol asked to be able to move past the line of guards to join the crowd. As the crowd continued to sing and call for justice for Black Americans, slowly the shields began to drop. The state troopers declined to drop their batons, but backed farther away from the crowd.Monday’s peaceful vigil was a marked difference from several protests that turned violent in Tennessee over the weekend.At least 5,600 people have been arrested in cities around the country since demonstrations broke out protesting the death of George Floyd, according to a tally compiled by Associated Press journalists from police department press releases, police agency Twitter activity and media.The arrests come as protests in some cities become more violent and as police and governors are urged by President Donald Trump to take a stronger hand in quelling the demonstrations.In Minneapolis, where Floyd died, some 155 arrests have taken place. Some of the biggest cities in the US have made a significant number of arrests, including nearly 800 in New York City and more than 900 in Los Angeles.Protesters took a knee in the middle of a downtown Washington street Monday night, chanting, “What do we want? Justice. When do we want it? Now.”They applauded as they rose to their feet and declared that the streets were theirs.The march Monday night was peaceful as nightfall approached. There was no apparent effort to get protesters off the streets even though a 7pm curfew had passed.Earlier, law enforcement officers on horseback and foot aggressively pushed the protesters away from Lafayette Park near the White House so that President Donald Trump could visit a church that was damaged by fire during the protests Sunday night. He took a photo while there.President Donald Trump has threatened to deploy the US military unless state governors halt violent protests.Trump said he was recommending that governors deploy the National Guard in sufficient numbers to “dominate the streets”.If governors fail to take action, Trump said he would deploy the US military and “quickly solve the problem for them.”Trump, in his Rose Garden remarks, said he would mobilise the US military to end “lawlessness” as police fired tear gas at hundreds of peaceful protesters gathered outside the White House.Police appeared to fire a series of flashbangs, as well as tear gas to disperse peaceful protesters outside the White House. The curfew in Washington, DC, has not yet gone into effect.Trump is due to speak at any moment.The Hennepin County Medical Examiner declared the death of George Floyd a homicide, saying he died of “cardiopulmonary arrest complicating law enforcement subdual restraint, and neck compression,” according to a Minneapolis television station.The updated report from the examiner states that Floyd died from a loss of blood flow due to compression on his neck while being restrained by Minneapolis police, local Fox television affiliate Fox 9 reported.Former US President Barack Obama on Monday condemned the use of violence at the nationwide protests while praising the actions of peaceful protesters seeking change. While the vast majority of protesters have been peaceful, a “small minority” was putting people at risk and harming the very communities the protests are intended to help, Obama wrote in an online essay posted on Medium.Obama, a Democrat who served two presidential terms prior to Republican Donald Trump, said the violence was “compounding the destruction of neighborhoods that are often already short on services and investment and detracting from the larger cause”.In his essay, Obama urged protesters not to be cynical about politics, arguing that electing new leaders on the national and local levels would bring about change.“Eventually, aspirations have to be translated into specific laws and institutional practices – and in a democracy, that only happens when we elect government officials who are responsive to our demands,” he said.The brother of George Floyd appealed for peace Monday in the aftermath of riots and arson fires following the death of his brother in Minneapolis.Terrence Floyd appeared at the intersection in south Minneapolis where his brother died. Wearing a face mask with the image of his brother’s face on it, Terrence Floyd spent several minutes of silence at the flowers and other memorials that have sprung up to his brother.“I understand you’re upset,” Terrence Floyd said to the crowd through a bullhorn. But he said civil unrest and destruction is “not going to bring my brother back at all. It may feel good for the moment, like when you drink, but when you are done, you’re going to wonder what did you do.”Terrence Floyd said his family is “a peaceful family. My family is God-fearing”. And he said, “in every case of police brutality, the same thing has been happening. You have protests; you destroy stuff … so they want us to destroy ourselves. Let’s do this another way.”He told the crowd to vote and to educate themselves. “Let’s switch it up, y’all.” He said his brother moved to Minneapolis from Houston and “loved it here. … So I know he would not want you all to be doing this”.New York City is imposing a curfew as the nation’s biggest city tries to head off another night of violence erupting amid protests over Floyd’s death. The curfew will last from 11pm Monday (03:00 GMT) to 5am Tuesday (09:00 GMT), Governor Andrew Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio said on Monday. The limitation on 8.6 million people’s movements comes on top of coronavirus restrictions and as the mayor and governor deplored the outbreaks of violence, but also criticised some police actions.Separately, Washington, DC Mayor Muriel Bowser said on Monday that the city also is imposing another curfew as it braces for several more days of protests. Bowser said at a news conference that the curfew would begin at 7pm Monday (23:00 GMT) and run through Tuesday morning, with similar restrictions beginning again on Tuesday night and continuing into Wednesday morning.Lawyers representing Floyd’s family said that independent medical examiners who conducted an autopsy of Floyd determined that asphyxiation from sustained pressure was the cause of death.“World renowned medical examiner Dr. Michael Baden and Dr. Allecia Wilson found the manner of Mr Floyd’s death was homicide caused by asphyxia due to neck and back compression that led to a lack of blood flow to the brain. Sustained pressure on the right side of Mr. Floyd’s carotid artery impeded blood flow to the brain, and weight on his back impeded his ability to breathe,” a statement from the lawyers read.“The independent examiners found that weight on the back, handcuffs and positioning were contributory factors because they impaired the ability of Mr. Floyd’s diaphragm to function. From all the evidence, the doctors said it now appears Mr Floyd died at the scene.”Baden said that what they found was “consistent with what people say. There was no other health issue that could cause or contribute to the death.”White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany told reporters that US President Donald Trump wants governors to utilise more National Guard troops to respond to protests against police brutality.Earlier on Monday, Trump told governors he wanted them to “dominate” protesters, urging the use of more aggressive tactics.White House press secretary just confirmed Trump had a call with Putin today but did not address a question about whether he asked him for advice before his call with the governors, as asked by the reporter.The White House on Monday said additional federal assets would soon be deployed to respond to protests across the country over the death of a Black man, George Floyd, while in police custody.The protests had turned violent in some places, which prompted many governors to turn to the National Guard for support. But the protesters have remained undeterred.President Donald Trump had two briefings on Monday, with Defense Secretary Mark Esper and Attorney General William Barr “and there will be additional federal assets deployed across the nation,” Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany said at a briefing.President Donald Trump on Monday derided the nation’s governors as “weak” and demanded tougher crackdowns on protesters in the aftermath of another night of violent protests in dozens of American cities.Trump spoke to governors on a video teleconference with law enforcement and national security officials, telling the local leaders they “have to get much tougher” amid nationwide protests and criticising their responses.“Most of you are weak,” Trump said. “You have to arrest people.”Joe Biden will hold a roundtable with several mayors whose cities have been affected by unrest over the weekend.The presumptive Democratic presidential nominee will hold a virtual event Monday with the leaders of Atlanta, Chicago, Los Angeles and St Paul, Minnesota.Biden began his day meeting with community leaders at a predominantly African American church in Delaware.District of Columbia Mayor Muriel Bowser is imposing a 7pm (23:00 GMT) curfew Monday and Tuesday after three days of protests, some of which have turned violent.An 11pm (03:00 GMT) curfew had been in place Sunday night. But the violence still escalated, with protesters setting fires, breaking windows and looting businesses. There were clashes with police, who used pepper spray and other measures to try to break up the demonstrations.    The attorney for George Floyd’s family was set to announce findings Monday of an independent autopsy into his death a week ago after a Minneapolis officer held his knee on Floyd’s neck for eight minutes and 46 seconds.An official autopsy last week said the combined effects of being restrained, potential intoxicants in Floyd’s system and his underlying health issues, including heart disease, likely contributed to his death. There were no other details about intoxicants, and toxicology results can take weeks. In the 911 call that drew police, the caller described the man suspected of paying with counterfeit money as “awfully drunk and he’s not in control of himself”.The criminal complaint noted that the medical examiner’s report was preliminary, but said the autopsy “revealed no physical findings that support a diagnosis of traumatic asphyxia or strangulation.”Ben Crump, the attorney representing Floyd’s family, soon announced plans to commission the family’s own autopsy.Authorities say the driver of a semitrailer that rolled into the midst of thousands of people marching on a closed Minneapolis freeway in protest over the death of George Floyd has been arrested on suspicion of assault.Authorities had said it appeared no one was hurt Sunday, but some witnesses said a handful of people who were on Interstate 35W near downtown Minneapolis sought medical attention on their own. Authorities said they could not confirm that.The freeway was among many shut down in the Minneapolis area for the second night in a row as officials imposed an 8pm (01:00 GMT) curfew and sought to make it more difficult for protesters to move around.Bystander video showed the crowd parting seconds before the semi rolled through, then the tanker truck gradually slowed and demonstrators swarmed the truck.Public Safety Commissioner John Harrington said Sunday that it initially appeared from traffic camera footage that the semitrailer was already on the freeway before barricades were set up at 5pm (22:00 GMT). State Corrections Commissioner Paul Schnell said at a later briefing, however, that the truck went around a traffic barrier to stay on the road.Read witness accounts here.United Kingdom Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s spokesman says arrests and assaults on journalists covering protests in the United States are “very concerning.”James Slack said Monday that “journalists all around the world must be free to do their job and to hold authorities to account without fear of arrest or violence.”He said the violence of the past few nights was “very alarming”, and noted, “people must be allowed to protest peacefully”.Slack said, “The footage of George Floyd’s death was deeply distressing, and our thoughts are with all those who have been affected.”Noting that a police officer has been charged with murder, he said: “We would hope and expect justice to be done.”The Louisville, Kentucky, police chief says police officers and US National Guard soldiers enforcing a curfew in Louisville killed a man early Monday when they returned fire after someone in a large group fired at them.Louisville Metro Police Chief Steve Conrad confirmed the shooting happened around 12:15am (04:15 GMT) outside a business on West Broadway, where police and the National Guard had been called to break up a large group of people gathering in defiance of the city’s curfew.Someone fired a shot at them, and the officers returned fire, the chief said. It was unclear whether the person killed is the one who fired at the law enforcers, he said.Protests have erupted in Louisville over the shooting death of Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old emergency medical technician who was shot eight times by narcotics detectives who knocked down her front door, as well as the death of George Floyd.____________________________________________________________________Hello and welcome to Al Jazeera’s continuing coverage of the protests in the US over the deadly arrest of George Floyd in Minneapolis, Minnesota. This is Laurin-Whitney Gottbrath in Louisville, Kentucky.Here are a few things to catch up on:See the updates from Sunday’s protests here.",
    "First of several planned services to honour Floyd, an unarmed Black man killed by police, takes place in Minneapolis.Minneapolis, Minnesota, US – Hundreds gathered on Thursday for the first of several planned memorials for George Floyd, an unarmed Black man killed by police in Minneapolis, Minnesota last week.The Minneapolis event kicked off a week of services to honour Floyd, whose death on May 25, captured on video, set off protests across the United States, and worldwide.The memorial, attended by family, friends and prominent civil rights figures, was livestreamed, starting at 1pm (18:00 GMT). Thousands gathered in a park nearby. Reverend Al Sharpton was scheduled to give the eulogy.On Thursday “we will lay out how we will mobilise nationally in the name of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, and more”, Sharpton tweeted on Wednesday, referring to the names of Black men and women killed by police or former law enforcement.Tomorrow we will lay out how we will mobilize nationally in the name of #GeorgeFloyd, AhmaudArbery, #BreonnaTaylor, and more. Cc: @attorneycrump @RealGwenCarr #QuincyFloyd @NationalAction #WeCantBreathe pic.twitter.com/zYCxLLO9oC— Reverend Al Sharpton (@TheRevAl) June 3, 2020Sharpton’s sentiment was shared by residents in Minneapolis, many of whom have attended daily protests, demanding justice for Floyd and an end to police violence.“I’m not only there for the people that died of police shootings, but I’m there for the 401 years of slavery and oppression – systematic oppression that my people had to deal with, and are still dealing with,” said Sada Cooper, a Minneapolis resident.“Like, when is it going to end?” she asked.Carlos Flemming said attending the memorial was not only a way to honour Floyd, but an “opportunity to take back this space and take back the narrative of what happened”.That narrative is what Floyd’s family and many protesters say is so important.“The image that most of us have of George Floyd is the horrible video that we’ve seen,” said Floyd family lawyer Chris Stewart on Wednesday, standing alongside Roxie Washington, the mother of Floyd’s six-year-old daughter, Gianna.Stewart was referring to the video, now seen around the world, in which Floyd repeatedly pleads for the white police officer kneeling on his neck to get off.“I can’t breathe,” Floyd repeatedly says before going motionless, still being pinned down by the officer’s knee.“We’ve seen the anger in the streets; we’ve seen so much violence; we’ve seen beauty, also. We’ve seen people standing up and speaking up, and we’ve seen massive changes across the country,” Stewart said. “But what we really wanted the world to see is the beauty of their child. The beauty of Gianna … The beauty of Roxie who is holding up strong throughout this. And the actual situations in life that these things affect.”Mina Mansaray, a Minneapolis resident, said she sees Thursday’s memorial as an opportunity to step back and reflect.“I feel like we just have to slow everything down for a little bit to appreciate the reality of life,” Mansaray told Al Jazeera. “Unfortunately, it’s the fact that Black people have to, have to struggle a little harder than everybody else, but look at what we’ve created.”Thursday’s service comes a day after prosecutors announced new charges against the four now-fired police officers involved in Floyd’s death.Derek Chauvin, the officer who knelt on Floyd’s neck, had his previously announced third-degree murder charge upgraded to second-degree murder. He also faces a second-degree manslaughter charge. The other three officers face aiding and abetting second-degree murder and manslaughter charges. All four are in custody.“This is a significant step forward on the road to justice, and we are gratified that this important action was brought before George Floyd’s body was laid to rest,” said prominent civil rights lawyer Ben Crump, who is also representing the Floyd family. “That is a source of peace for George’s family in this painful time.”Services will also be held in North Carolina – where Floyd was born – and Houston – where he lived for a time. Floyd will be buried in Houston at a private service next week.To Cooper attending Thursday’s memorial gives everyone a chance “to show a sense of community, to show that everybody’s on one accord”.“Everybody’s here for the same purpose. Everybody has the same mindset,” she said. “And we’re all looking for the same outcome … It feels like one body, and that’s what God intended for us to be. One body.”",
    "Major cities gripped by another night of protests decrying police brutality following killing of an unarmed Black man.Demonstrations against racism and police brutality have spread to even more cities across the United States as people in many parts of the country defied curfews to protest against the killing of George Floyd.The days-long protests sweeping the nation have reawakened outrage over years of deaths of Black people at the hands of police, renewing long-standing accusations of institutionalised and systemic racism.After a night of unrest on Friday, racially diverse and largely peaceful protests took over streets in major cities throughout the country during Saturday’s daytime hours.Participants held signs saying “Black Lives Matter” and chanted “I can’t breathe” – some of Floyd’s last words before he died on Monday shortly after a white police officer in Minneapolis, Minnesota, pinned him down with a knee to the neck for several minutes.In New York, a city that is yet to emerge from the ravages of the coronavirus pandemic, a series of protests took place across its five boroughs.“I’m here for George Floyd; I’m here for all those who have lost their lives [to] police brutality,” Paige Porter, a protester in New York, told Al Jazeera.“America is sick and we have to root out racism,” Caroline Nixon, a white demonstrator, said. “I think that white people need to stand up and do something instead of sitting on their couch.”By late on Saturday, many of the nationwide demonstrations turned violent amid tense standoffs between police and protesters. The unrest saw some police cars set ablaze and stores ransacked as officers used tear gas and rubber bullets during confrontations.Authorities in a number of cities imposed overnight curfews in a bid to control the escalating situation, affecting millions of people including in Los Angeles, Miami and Chicago.In Minneapolis, hundreds of protesters were still out as an 8pm curfew began on Saturday. The demonstrators have promised to continue taking to the streets at least until all four officers involved in Floyd’s death have been charged. So far, only one officer – Derek Chauvin – has been arrested in connection to Floyd’s death.Minnesota Governor Tim Walz meanwhile ordered a full mobilisation of National Guard soldiers, the first time in the state’s history.Minneapolis’s streets steadily grew calmer as the night went on, and Corrections Commissioner Paul Schnell said the tough response would remain as long as it takes to “quell this situation”.Governors in Georgia, Kentucky, Ohio and Texas also activated the National Guard.Overall, few corners of the country were untouched in the unrest – from protesters setting fires inside Reno’s city hall, to police launching tear gas at rock-throwing demonstrators in Fargo, North Dakota, to shattered windows at police headquarters in Richmond, Virginia.In central Indianapolis, police were investigating “multiple shootings”, including one that left a person dead, amid the protests. Police gave few details but said no officers were involved.In Philadelphia, at least 13 officers were injured when peaceful protests turned violent and at least four police vehicles were set on fire. Other fires were set throughout downtown.In Salt Lake City, protesters defying a curfew flipped a police car and lit it on fire, and another vehicle was later set ablaze. Police said six people were arrested and a police officer was injured after being struck in the head with a baseball bat.In Los Angeles, protesters chanted “Black Lives Matter”, some within inches of the face shields of officers. Police used batons to move the crowd back and fired rubber bullets. A graffiti-covered police car burned in the street.In New York, dangerous confrontations flared repeatedly as officers made arrests and cleared streets.In Washington, the National Guard was deployed outside the White House, where chanting crowds taunted law enforcement officers. Dressed in camouflage and holding shields, the troops stood in a tight line a few yards from the crowd, preventing them from pushing forward.President Donald Trump, who spent much of Saturday in Florida for the SpaceX rocket launch, landed on the lawn in the presidential helicopter at dusk and went inside without speaking to journalists. The Republican president has taken a highly partisan tone, calling for a tougher crackdown on protesters and accusing them of being “radical-left criminals”.Trump said the federal government was coordinating with local authorities across the nation, as the response became increasingly militarised.“My administration will stop mob violence and will stop it cold,” he said.",
    "The protests that started in the US have spread, leading to the removal of statues with racist legacies.The police killing of George Floyd has triggered anti-racism protests around the world. A number of monuments with links to colonialism and slavery have either been defaced or pulled down in Europe and the US as protests continue for racial justice.New York’s state legislature is moving forward with police reform measures as the US Army, Navy as well as a number of other states look at measures they can take to address racial inequality.Floyd’s death, after an officer who has now been charged with second-degree murder knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes, has triggered a US-wide debate on the future of law enforcement.Spurred on by US anti-racism protests, lower-caste Dalits have called on India to acknowledge centuries of oppression they have endured and recognise that “every life matters”.Dalits are at the bottom of India’s ancient caste hierarchy, whose membership was determined at birth, and have historically faced violence, segregation and been barred from even having their shadows touch those of people from higher castes.“We extend our solidarity because we feel them and we have faced discrimination ourselves,” said Omprakash Mahato, president of the Birsa Ambedkar Phule Students Association, a Dalit organisation at Jawaharlal Nehru University.Social network company Reddit has named venture capital investor Michael Seibel to its board, days after co-founder and former director Alexis Ohanian resigned and called for the company to replace him with a black candidate.Ohanian’s resignation came as the death of Floyd reignited the debate of diversity in America’s corporate boardrooms.Responding to Ohanian’s request, Chief Executive Officer Steve Huffman said on Friday, “the unacceptable gap” between Reddit’s content policy and values has reduced the company’s effectiveness in combating hate and racism, and slowed down its response to problems.German sportswear brand Adidas has pledged to invest $20m in the black community in the US and make sure that at least 30 percent of all new US jobs are filled with black and Latino people at its Adidas and Reebok brands.The Adidas managing board said in a statement it recognised the contribution of the black community to its success, but admitted the company must do more to fight racism and improve company culture to ensure equity, diversity and opportunity.“While we have talked about the importance of inclusion, we must do more to create an environment in which all of our employees feel safe, heard and have equal opportunity to advance their careers,” Chief Executive Kasper Rorsted said.After a heated, 14-hour debate, Tunisia’s parliament has rejected a motion calling on France to apologise for crimes permitted during the colonial era and pay reparations.Opponents argued that such a move would spell economic disaster, given that France is Tunisia’s top trade partner and foreign investor. It is also home to one million Tunisians.But proponents of the motion said an apology is necessary to “turn the page on this dark period” in the history of the two countries and put their relations on a more equal footing.The debate came amid renewed anger in some European countries about colonialism’s crimes, stemming from protests in the US Floyd’s death.A city in North Carolina has unanimously passed a resolution to begin a removal process for its confederate monuments, news outlets reported.The joint action by the Asheville City Council and Buncombe County would establish a task force to recommend steps to remove or repurpose the monuments at the county courthouse and in the city’s Pack Square Park, WLOS-TV reported.The move comes amid national protests that has seen Confederate monuments toppled and taken down all across the South.⚡Which statues have been toppled by the global anti-racism protests? https://t.co/GIv7oUjzMk— Al Jazeera English (@AJEnglish) June 10, 2020Formula One world champion Lewis Hamilton said the recent global protests against racism “is only the beginning and there is so much change to come.”  The British Mercedes driver wrote on social media that “these past few weeks, we’ve seen the world open its eyes to the realities of racism today.”While a lot remains to be done, Hamilton said, he wanted to “appreciate the positive steps that have been taken so far.”pic.twitter.com/ry6pHFWg7o— Lewis Hamilton (@LewisHamilton) June 9, 2020The American reference dictionary Merriam-Webster will change its definition of the word racism at the suggestion of a young black woman, who wanted it to better reflect the oppression of people of color.Kennedy Mitchum, a recent graduate of Drake University in Iowa, contacted Merriam-Webster, which has published its dictionaries since 1847, to propose updating the term.“I basically told them that they need to include that there’s a systematic oppression upon a group of people,” she told the local CBS affiliate KMOV. “It’s not just, ‘Oh, I don’t like someone.'”Merriam-Webster’s editorial manager Peter Sokolowski confirmed to AFP that the definition would be modified after Mitchum’s request.After 33 seasons on the air, the police documentary series Cops has been dropped by the Paramount Network as protests against police proliferate around the world.“Cops is not on the Paramount Network and we don’t have any current or future plans for it to return,” a spokesperson for the cable channel said in a statement. The show had been pulled temporarily from the air in late May, when protests aimed at police over the death of Floyd began to gain momentum.The show's 33rd season had been schedule to premiere on Monday, but no episode has aired on Paramount Network since at least June 1 https://t.co/Z8rRirJwB0— The Hollywood Reporter (@THR) June 10, 2020“Gone with the Wind” has been removed from the HBO Max streaming platform, as mass protests against racism and police brutality prompt television networks to reassess their offerings.  The multiple Oscar-winning US Civil War epic released in 1939 remains the highest-grossing movie of all time adjusted for inflation, but its depiction of contented slaves and heroic slaveholders has garnered criticism.  “‘Gone With The Wind’ is a product of its time and depicts some of the ethnic and racial prejudices that have, unfortunately, been commonplace in American society,” an HBO Max spokesperson said in a statement to AFP. “These racist depictions were wrong then and are wrong today, and we felt that to keep this title up without an explanation and a denouncement of those depictions would be irresponsible.”HBO Max just removed Gone With the Wind from its platform citing concerns about racial injustice.Here is the video of Hattie McDaniel becoming the first African-American to win an Academy Award for her role as Mammy in the film. pic.twitter.com/l0vh8pdpex— Daily Caller (@DailyCaller) June 10, 2020Naomi Osaka, the world’s highest paid sportswoman, says the voices of prominent athletes can be more influential than those of politicians and is determined that hers will be heard on the subject of racial injustice.The two-times Grand Slam champion has faced a backlash on social media after throwing her support behind the Black Lives Matter protests in the wake of the death of Floyd. “I’m vocal because I believe in the movement and want to try to use my platform to facilitate change,” Osaka told Reuters via email. “Being silent is never the answer.

    "The former officers appeared in court for a hearing on the prosecution’s request to move the trial out of Minneapolis.Prosecutors in the case of four former Minneapolis officers charged in the death of George Floyd told a judge Friday that the men should face trial together because the evidence and charges against them are similar, and multiple trials could traumatise witnesses and Floyd’s family.But defence lawyers have argued for separate trials, saying they would likely offer “antagonistic” defences and the evidence against one officer could negatively affect another.The former officers appeared in court Friday for a hearing on the prosecution’s request to hold a joint trial, a defence request to move the trial out of Minneapolis, and other issues. Judge Peter Cahill took most issues under advisement, but granted a defence request to remove a local prosecutor from the case.Floyd, a Black man in handcuffs, died May 25 after Derek Chauvin pressed his knee against Floyd’s neck as Floyd said he could not breathe. Chauvin is charged with second-degree murder, third-degree murder and manslaughter. Thomas Lane, J Kueng and Tou Thao are charged with aiding and abetting second-degree murder and manslaughter.Chauvin, who is in custody, appeared in person for the first time, after attending previous hearings via videoconference. He did not make eye contact with any of the defendants as he arrived, but Kueng looked at him as he passed and Lane glanced over.Attorney General Keith Ellison, whose office has taken the lead on prosecution, was also in court.Cahill said Friday that four Hennepin County prosecutors including County Attorney Mike Freeman are disqualified from the trial because they met with the county medical examiner to discuss autopsy results. Cahill said they could be called as witnesses. Freeman has long been out of favour with local activists for the way his office has handled cases against police officers.Before the hearing, a few dozen protesters gathered in front of the court, chanting “No justice, no peace.” One carried a Black Lives Matter flag and wore a black helmet with swim goggles around the back of his head. By the time the hearing ended, a large, loud crowd had gathered outside. Some beat drums while others chanted anti-police slogans.Prosecutors said in court filings that the case should proceed with one trial because the evidence – including witness statements, body camera video and police department policy on the use of force – is similar for each officer.Neal Katyal, an outside special attorney assisting the prosecution, told Cahill on Friday that the “interests of justice” favour one trial because multiple trials would place a burden on the court and witnesses, and could delay justice for months, if not years.Katyal also said publicity about a verdict in a first trial could prejudice the jury pool for later trials. A joint trial “would allow the community to absorb the verdicts at once. … We don’t think they should be put through the trauma of four different jury verdicts,” he said.Defence lawyer Earl Gray, who represents Lane, and other lawyers argued briefly against trying the ex-officers together but relied mostly on written arguments. Gray said if trials were separate and Chauvin was tried first and acquitted, the others would essentially be cleared.Finger-pointing already prevailed in defence court filings. Lawyers for Lane and Kueng argued their clients were rookies who followed Chauvin’s lead. Thao’s lawyer, Bob Paule, said his client’s role was “absolutely distinct” from the others, because he was on crowd control while the others restrained Floyd.Chauvin’s lawyer, Eric Nelson, wrote that his client’s defence will be different, and the other men are already saying that if Chauvin committed a crime, they did not know about it or assist in it.“They blame Chauvin,” he wrote.But Chauvin pointed fingers, too. Nelson wrote that Lane and Kueng – the officers who responded to a forgery call – initiated contact with Floyd, and that Chauvin arrived and believed Floyd was overdosing on fentanyl. Nelson wrote that while Lane and Kueng called for a paramedic and believed Floyd was “on something,” they didn’t elevate the call to one of more urgency or give medical assistance. Nelson wrote that Chauvin could argue their inaction led to Floyd’s death.“If EMS had arrived just three minutes sooner, Mr. Floyd may have survived. If Kueng and Lane had chosen to de-escalate instead of struggle, Mr. Floyd may have survived. If Kueng and Lane had recognized the apparent signs of an opioid overdose and rendered aid, such as administering naloxone, Mr. Floyd may have survived,” Nelson wrote.Ben Crump, a lawyer for Floyd’s family members, said afterwards that the hearing was emotional.“They are trying to claim some asinine theory about an overdose. I want to be clear about this. The only overdose that killed George Floyd was an overdose of excessive force and racism by the Minnesota, Minneapolis, police department,” Crump said“Who are you going to believe, your eyes or these killer cops?” he said.Lawyers for all four men have also asked that the trial be moved from Minneapolis, saying pretrial publicity has made it impossible for them to receive a fair trial. Cahill deferred most of that discussion, but said he would like to send out questionnaires to potential Hennepin County jurors to find out whether they’ve seen the pretrial coverage or whether they have been affected by it.Paule, Thao’s lawyer, argued for moving the trial, noting the several nights of unrest in Minneapolis that followed Floyd’s death.The sides were split on whether the jury should be kept anonymous. Some lawyers said they have received angry calls from people who think their clients are guilty, and expressed fear that jurors would be subject to coercion if their names become public during the trial.Nelson said his client was “persona non grata number one in Minnesota” and expressed concern about pressure on the jurors if their names got out.“This incident has caused civil unrest not just nationally, but internationally,” he said.",
    "The white officer who pinned down an unarmed black man with his knee is charged with third-degree murder, manslaughter.The white police officer who was seen on video kneeling on the neck of George Floyd, a handcuffed black man who died in custody after pleading that he could not breathe, was arrested Friday and charged with murder in a case that sparked protests across the United States and violence in Minneapolis, Minnesota.Derek Chauvin, the officer seen on a bystander’s mobile phone video kneeling on Floyd’s neck on Monday before the 46-year-old man died, has been charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter, Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman told a news briefing.“He is in custody and has been charged with murder,” Freeman said of Chauvin. “We have evidence, we have the citizen’s camera’s video, the horrible, horrific, terrible thing we have all seen over and over again, we have the officer’s body-worn camera, we have statements from some witnesses.”The mobile phone footage showed Floyd repeatedly moaning and gasping while he pleaded to Chauvin, kneeling on his neck, “Please, I can’t breathe.” After several minutes, Floyd gradually grows quiet and ceases to move.The arrest and charges come after three days of protests, which escalated in violence as demonstrators torched a police precinct that had been abandoned by officers.Residents welcomed the charges, but said the other three officers involved must also be arrested and charged. Freeman said those officers were still under investigation.With smoke drifting over Minneapolis, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz on Friday acknowledged the “abject failure” of the response to this week’s violent protests and called for swift justice for police involved in Floyd’s death.Walz said the state would take over the response and that it’s time to show respect and dignity to those who are suffering. The US National Guard had arrived in Minneapolis by midday Thursday.“Minneapolis and Saint Paul are on fire. The fire is still smouldering in our streets. The ashes are symbolic of decades and generations of pain, of anguish unheard,” Walz said, adding, “Now generations of pain is manifesting itself in front of the world – and the world is watching.”His comments came the morning after protesters torched a police station that officers abandoned during a third night of violence.Livestream video showed protesters entering the building, where intentionally set fires activated smoke alarms and sprinklers. US President Donald Trump threatened action, tweeting “when the looting starts, the shooting starts”, which prompted a warning from Twitter for “glorifying violence”.The governor faced tough questions after National Guard leader Major General Jon Jensen blamed a lack of clarity about the guard’s mission for a slow response. Walz said the state was in a supporting role and that it was up to city leaders to run the situation.“You will not see that tonight, there will be no lack of leadership,” Walz said.Dozens of fires were also set in nearby Saint Paul, where nearly 200 businesses were damaged or looted. Protests spread across the US, fuelled by outrage over Floyd’s death, and years of violence against African Americans at the hands of police.",
    "LAPD officers allegedly circulated a photo of Floyd with the caption: ‘You take my breath away’.A report that Los Angeles Police Department officers circulated a photo of George Floyd with the words “you take my breath away” in a Valentine-like format has prompted an internal investigation and drawn blistering condemnation as authorities in Minnesota prepare for the trial of the police officer charged for Floyd’s murder.LAPD chief Michel Moore said on Saturday that investigators will try to determine how the image may have come into the workplace and who may have been involved, the Los Angeles Times reported. Moore said the officer who made the complaint would be interviewed on Monday.“Our investigation is to determine the accuracy of the allegations while also reinforcing our zero tolerance for anything with racist views,” Moore said.Floyd, a Black man, died last May after former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin pressed a knee on his neck as Floyd repeatedly said, “I can’t breathe.” His death launched massive, worldwide protests against police brutality and racism.Ben Crump, a lawyer for Floyd’s family, condemned the officers.“This is beyond insult on top of injury — it’s injury on top of death. The type of callousness and cruelty within a person’s soul needed to do something like this evades comprehension — and is indicative of a much larger problem within the culture of the LAPD,” Crump said in a statement released via Twitter.MEDIA ALERT: @AttorneyCrump releases a statement on the George Floyd image that was reportedly circulated throughout @LAPDHQ. This is injury on top of death and indicative of a much larger problem within the culture of the LAPD. pic.twitter.com/7XiM3mNjEu— Ben Crump Law, PLLC (@BenCrumpLaw) February 15, 2021“We demand that everyone who was involved is held accountable for their revolting behavior and that an apology be issued to the family immediately.”Los Angeles County District Attorney George Gascon condemned the image, saying he would investigate the matter to see if any of his cases “may have been compromised by biased police work”.The board of directors for the Los Angeles Police Protective League said in a statement that the union “repudiates this abhorrent image” and that any officer who “feels the need to be part of any online group that engages in, promotes, and/or celebrates this type of activity should quickly rethink their career choice because they clearly don’t have the judgment, nor temperament, to be a member of law enforcement”.The LAPD investigation takes place as Minnesota authorities prepare for Chauvin’s trial for second-degree murder and manslaughter in Floyd’s death case.Judge Peter Cahill ruled last month that Chauvin would stand trial on his own starting March 8, dismissing appeals for a delay and to be tried with former officers Thomas Lane, J Alexander Kueng and Tou Thao, who face charges of aiding and abetting murder in relation to Floyd’s death.From left: Derek Chauvin, J Alexander Kueng, Thomas Lane and Tou Thao, the four police officers charged in the killing of George Floyd [File: Hennepin County Sheriff’s Office via AP Photo]The three other former officers will stand trial together on August 23. Cahill cited a lack of courtroom space for proper COVID-19 protocols in starting their trial in the summer.Local courts are not set to restart jury trials before March 15. For Chauvin’s trial, Cahill granted an exception.Chauvin was ready to plead guilty to third-degree murder, but former Attorney General William Barr blocked the deal because it was too early in the investigation, The Associated Press news agency and The New York Times reported.Minnesota lawmakers on Monday pulled a proposal from Governor Tim Walz to create a $35m fund to bolster security during Chauvin’s trial.Leaders in Minnesota’s House admitted they lacked enough votes to pass it. The Republican-controlled Senate voted earlier on Monday to allow the state to garnish Minneapolis state aid to ensure security costs get paid.Local, state and federal authorities have been preparing for demonstrations and potential civil unrest for months.They fear a repeat of the violence that erupted after Black Lives Matter protests began in Minneapolis and spread worldwide, leading to a national reckoning over race.",
    "Some critics use US unrest to highlight what they see as American hypocrisy on protest movements at home vs abroad.Demonstrators from Australia to Europe identified with the cause of US protests and urged their own governments to address racism and police violence.Opponents of the United States’s foreign policy under President Donald Trump, meanwhile, took the opportunity to pour scorn on the violence that has engulfed the country after the killing of George Floyd, an unarmed Black man, by police officers in the city of Minneapolis last week.  Floyd died last week after he was pinned to the pavement by a police officer who put his knee on the handcuffed man’s neck until he stopped breathing. His killing set off protests that spread rapidly across the US.Thousands of protesters marched through downtown Sydney, Australia, on Tuesday, voicing their solidarity with Americans demonstrating against Floyd’s killing.Protesters in Australia’s largest city chanted, “I can’t breathe” – some of the final words of both Floyd and David Dungay, a 26-year-old Aboriginal man who died in a Sydney prison in 2015 while being restrained by five guards.Demonstrators carried placards reading, “Black Lives Matter”, “Aboriginal Lives Matter”, and “White Silence is Violence.”Linda Burney, an opposition spokeswoman on Indigenous Australians, said more than 430 Indigenous people had died in Australian police custody since 1991.While Indigenous adults make up only 2 percent of the Australian population, they account for 27 percent of the prison population.“I think we should be using it as an opportunity,” Burney told Australian Broadcasting Corp, referring to Floyd’s death. “Whether we like it or not, it doesn’t take much for racism to come out of the underbelly of this country.”Some have seen the US unrest as a chance to highlight what they see as American hypocrisy on protest movements at home versus abroad. China’s foreign ministry spokesperson called out US racism as “a chronic disease of American society”. China’s comments come at a time when relations with the US are particularly strained. Chinese state media is giving extensive coverage to the violent protests roiling American cities, while the unrest has also featured widely in Chinese social media.On social media platform Weibo, at least five news items on the protests were among the top 20 trending topics by midday, led by reports Trump had been temporarily taken to a bunker as protesters surrounded the White House.On Twitter, the protests also featured widely among the top 20 trending items, with the hashtag #BunkerBoy at a prominent second place. In Europe, thousands spilled across streets in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, to denounce police brutality, and those demonstrating in Paris urged the French government to take police violence more seriously and held up signs including “Racism is suffocating us”.The EU’s diplomatic chief Josep Borrell condemned the “abuse of power”, saying Europe is “shocked and appalled” by the police killing of Floyd. He urged US authorities to rein in the “excessive use of force” as Trump ordered the military to intervene.Germany announced its support for the demonstrations.“The peaceful protests that we see in the US … are understandable and more than legitimate. I hope that these peaceful protests won’t slide further into violence, but even more than that I hope that they will make a difference in the United States,” Foreign Minister Heiko Maas told reporters.Iran’s foreign ministry called on the US to “stop violence” against its own people.“To the American people: the world has heard your outcry over the state of oppression. The world is standing with you,” foreign ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi said at a news conference in Tehran.“And to the American officials and police: Stop violence against your people and let them breathe,” he told reporters in English.Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam, meanwhile, questioned foreign criticism of China, including from the US, over an imminent national security law being imposed in the Chinese territory.“They take their own country’s national security very seriously, but for the security of our country, especially the situation in Hong Kong, they are looking at it through tinted glasses,” she said.Ghana’s President Nana Akufo-Addo said Black people across the world are “shocked and distraught” by Floyd’s killing.“Black people, the world over, are shocked and distraught by the killing of an unarmed Black man, George Floyd, by a white police officer in the United States of America,” Akufo-Addo said in a statement.“We stand with our kith and kin in America in these difficult and trying times.”Kenyan opposition leader and former prime minister Raila Odinga offered a prayer for the US “that there be justice and freedom for all human beings who call America their country”.Like some in Africa who have spoken out, Odinga also noted troubles at home, saying the judging of people by character instead of skin colour “is a dream we in Africa, too, owe our citizens”.And South Africa’s finance minister, Tito Mboweni, recalled leading a small protest outside the US Embassy several years ago over the apparent systemic killings of Blacks. Mboweni said the US ambassador at the time, Patrick Gaspard, “invited me to his office and said: ‘What you see is nothing, it is much worse’.”Zimbabwe summoned the ambassador of the United States to the country over remarks by a senior US official accusing it of stirring anti-racism protests following Floyd’s death. In an interview with ABC News, US national security adviser Robert O’Brien referred to Zimbabwe and China as “foreign adversaries” using social media to stoke unrest and “sow discord” after the killing.Zimbabwe’s foreign ministry spokesman James Manzou said US Ambassador Brian Nichols was called in to explain O’Brien’s remarks. Government spokesman Nick Mangwana said Zimbabwe did not consider itself “America’s adversary”.  “We prefer having friends and allies to having unhelpful adversity with any other nation including the USA,” Mangwana said.",
    "Major cities rocked by nationwide demonstrations decrying police brutality following killing of an unarmed black man.Tens of thousands of people protested across the United States and in major world cities for a sixth night as outrage over police brutality intensified over the death of George Floyd.Floyd, 46, an unarmed black man, died last Monday after a white Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck as he pleaded “I can’t breathe”, sparking outrage that has swept across a politically and racially divided nation.In Minneapolis on Sunday, a tanker truck driver drove into a massive crowd of demonstrators. The driver was pulled from his rig and beaten. No protesters appeared to be injured and the driver was later arrested.“I hate to see my city like this but at the end we need justice,” said 18-year-old Jahvon Craven as he stood on an overpass watching protesters below in downtown Minneapolis.Protesters in Philadelphia hurled rocks and Molotov cocktails at police, while thieves in more than 20 Californian cities smashed their way into businesses and ran off with as much as they could carry. Major US cities imposed curfews in fear of another night of demonstrations descending into violence and looting.In Washington, DC, protesters set fires near the White House, the smoke mixing with billowing clouds of tear gas as police sought to clear them from the area. Sporadic violence broke out in Boston following peaceful protests as activists threw bottles at police officers and lit a police 4WD on fire.Several hundred demonstrators marched through downtown Miami chanting: “No justice, no peace,” past a detention centre where inmates could be seen in the narrow windows waving shirts.The Minneapolis Police Department said on Twitter about 150 protesters who remained out after the 8pm curfew were arrested.Protests spread around the globe with events in London and Berlin on Sunday, and others on Monday including in New Zealand, Australia and the Netherlands.The closely packed crowds and demonstrators not wearing masks sparked fears of a resurgence of COVID-19, which has killed more than 100,000 Americans.Demonstrators have flooded streets after weeks of lockdowns during the coronavirus pandemic, which threw millions out of work and hit minority communities especially hard.Sunday’s protests demonstrated that the arrest of Derek Chauvin, the police officer seen kneeling on Floyd’s neck, failed to satisfy protesters. Three officers who stood by as Floyd died have yet to be charged.Minnesota Governor Tim Walz said Attorney General Keith Ellison will take the lead in any prosecutions over the death of Floyd.Walz told reporters that Ellison “needs to lead this case”. He said he made the decision after speaking with Floyd’s family who “wanted to believe that there was a trust, and they wanted to believe that the facts would be heard”.In San Francisco, more than 1,000 people marched through the streets, carrying signs and chanting “George Floyd” and “Black Lives Matter”.Los Angeles County declared a 6pm curfew to prevent a repeat of the violence that broke out on Saturday night. But fires were lit in Long Beach and National Guard troops were called in.The county and city of Los Angeles declared states of emergency on Sunday after a night of looting, vandalism and arson that followed mostly peaceful protests.Philadelphia announced a 6pm curfew and ordered all businesses to close as local news showed images of groups of protesters attacking police cars. Other people went into nearby stores and came out with armfuls of merchandise.One closely watched protest was outside the state capitol in Minneapolis’ twin city of St Paul, where several thousand people gathered peacefully before marching down a highway.“We have black sons, black brothers, black friends, we don’t want them to die. We are tired of this happening, this generation is not having it, we are tired of oppression,” said Muna Abdi, a 31-year-old black woman who joined the protest.In St Paul, state troopers surrounded the state capitol building. About 170 stores in the city have been looted, its mayor said.In response to the protests, Target Corp announced it was temporarily closing 100 stores, about 30 of them in Minnesota.The administration of President Donald Trump, who has called protesters “thugs”, will not federalise and take control of the National Guard for now, national security adviser Robert O’Brien said.The National Guard said on Sunday that 5,000 soldiers and airmen had been activated in 15 states and Washington, DC, but that “state and local law enforcement agencies remain responsible for security”.A presidential move to federalise National Guard troops is rare, occurring about 12 times since the mid-1900s, mostly during the Civil Rights era of the 1960s, according to the National Guard press office. It was not invoked in protests following the deaths of other Black men in recent years in Ferguson, Missouri, and Baltimore.Get tough Democrat Mayors and Governors. These people are ANARCHISTS. Call in our National Guard NOW. The World is watching and laughing at you and Sleepy Joe. Is this what America wants? NO!!!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 31, 2020Trump said on Sunday the US government would designate anti-fascist group Antifa as a “terrorist” organisation. It was not clear how many of the protesters participating in demonstrations are from Antifa.“Get tough Democrat Mayors and Governors,” Trump said on Twitter on Sunday afternoon. “These people are ANARCHISTS. Call in our National Guard NOW. The World is watching and laughing at you and Sleepy Joe. Is this what America wants? NO!!!”“Sleepy Joe” is Trump’s nickname for Democrat Joe Biden, his presumptive rival for the presidency in the November election.One closely watched protest was outside the state capitol in Minneapolis’ twin city of St Paul, where several thousand people gathered before marching down a highway.“We have black sons, black brothers, black friends, we don’t want them to die.

    "Mass demonstrations without physical distancing and other safety precautions has heightened risk of coronavirus spread.Nationwide protests against police brutality in the US have seen thousands of people demonstrating in close quarters, chanting, shouting, and coughing when hit by tear gas, something that has raised concerns over the spread of the coronavirus.Experts say racialised police violence is a grave and neglected public health crisis for African Americans, threatening not just their lives but increasing their risk of developing stress-related diseases, from heart failure to cancer.It has been over a week since George Floyd, an African American man, died after a white police officer knelt on his neck for several minutes, sparking a wave of protests across the country against institutional racism.For Ebony Hilton, a physician at the University of Virginia hospital who is herself Black, the issue highlights what she calls the threat of the two pandemics: COVID-19 and police brutality.“We are expecting to see a spike (in coronavirus cases) because there’s no social distancing and unfortunately most people wear their masks incorrectly,” she told AFP news agency.“The pepper spraying and resulting coughing/gagging also heightens risk,” said Hilton. “Additionally, COVID can be spread via droplets on eyes, and many aren’t wearing goggles.”Law enforcement agencies have routinely fired tear-inducing pepper spray and tear gas, a nerve agent that causes intense burning, in order to disperse crowds.On Monday, federal police hit peaceful activists in Lafayette Park outside the White House with rubber bullets and tear gas in order to let President Donald Trump get a photo-op at a historic church that had suffered damage the night before.Even so, said Hilton, it was important to contextualise why people were willing to take these risks. A study carried out in 2019 found that Black men are 2.5 times more likely to be killed by the police than their white counterparts.“We think that there’s ample evidence that police are a threat to public health in the United States,” Rutgers University’s Frank Edwards, the lead author of the paper, told AFP at the time.Relying on media reports as well as official data, Edwards and colleagues estimated one fatality from police use of force for every 1,000 Black male births.Police violence is a leading cause of death for Black men aged 20-29, just behind cancer.The problem is not just the high-profile deaths that make the news, but the psychological stress inflicted on African Americans continually targeted by police.“What we know is that chronic stress is directly linked to increased risk of cancer formation, directly linked to hypertension, to diabetes, to heart failure, to obesity,” said Hilton.Cav Manning, a 52-year-old emcee from New York, is just one of tens of thousands nationwide willing to risk coronavirus as he joined a protest in Brooklyn on Monday evening.“What we saw is so disturbing that we’ve got to be out here right now, despite COVID, despite the fact that you might get infected,” he told AFP.The demonstrations come as the number of new coronavirus deaths in the US, the world’s hardest-hit country, continues to decrease after peaking in mid-April, and as states partly reopen their economies.Research has linked warmer summer months to a decreased COVID-19 spread in temperate parts of the world.Brandon Brown, an epidemiologist at the University of California Riverside, said that while the expected risk of COVID-19 transmission is lowered outdoors, it is not reduced to zero, especially when people are unable to physically distance when faced with charging police.“It is important to wear a mask not only to protect yourself against COVID-19, but also from state surveillance,” he emphasised.Robert Glatter, an emergency physician in New York, added that the aerosol produced by tear gas itself could potentially act as a carrier that projects viral droplets far deeper into a crowd than they would otherwise have travelled.All of these factors have combined to make public health professionals very nervous about the impact two or so weeks down the line.Manning, the emcee, said he and others were aware of the danger.“But this is also something that is happening for the health of the nation.”",
    "Hundreds rally outside Minneapolis government building where trial of ex-police officer who kneeled on Floyd’s neck will be heard.Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States – A few hundred demonstrators gathered on Monday outside the Hennepin County Government Center in Minneapolis, where the trial of former police officer Derek Chauvin, charged in the death of George Floyd, is set to begin this month.Many protesters expressed anxiety about whether Chauvin would be convicted in Minnesota’s first publicly broadcast trial, which will make it one of the most widely watched police brutality cases in recent history.But they pledged to maintain their demand for Chauvin’s conviction.“We’re going to continue showing up for community,” said Minneapolis NAACP Vice President Anika Bowie. “We understand that justice will prevail within us. We will show up, and we will be very persistent, challenging the system.”Jury selection was originally set to begin on Monday, but a court ruling that the judge must consider adding a third-degree murder charge pushed it to at least Tuesday.Protesters rally outside the Minneapolis trial of former police officer Derek Chauvin, charged in relation to the death of George Floyd [Jackie Renzetti/Al Jazeera]Chauvin currently faces second-degree murder and manslaughter charges after kneeling on Floyd’s neck for more than eight minutes during an arrest in May 2020 that was captured on video.Three other officers, who did not intervene as Floyd repeatedly said he could not breathe, will be tried together in August on aiding and abetting charges.Lawyers for Chauvin, who was fired from the police force the day after Floyd’s death, have argued that he correctly followed his training, Reuters news agency reported.An unusually long period of three weeks has been allotted for finding an impartial jury – a likely arduous task.The questionnaire for prospective jurors includes questions about their prior knowledge of the case, which spurred mass demonstrations for racial justice across the United States and around the world.As a rotating lineup of speakers addressed the crowd in Minneapolis, 28-year-old Josh Simms stood quietly with a sign reading, “We demand justice.”Simms said he moved from Chicago to Minneapolis to attend the University of Minnesota in 2013. In that time, four high-profile police killings have occurred in the Minneapolis area.In 2015, Minneapolis police fatally shot 24-year-old Jamar Clark. The two officers at the scene – the city never clarified which officer pulled the trigger – were not charged.Less than a year later, in a nearby suburb, 32-year-old Philando Castile was pulled over and shot repeatedly by police officer Jeronimo Yanez, who ultimately was cleared by a jury of second-degree manslaughter and two counts of dangerous discharge of a firearm.“There really hasn’t been any change,” Simms told Al Jazeera. “Knowing how history is, there’s the chance he’ll (Chauvin) be acquitted.”Josh Simms says judging by a history of police shootings in Minneapolis, there is a chance Chauvin will be acquitted [Jackie Renzetti/Al Jazeera]A few months after Yanez was acquitted, Minneapolis police officer Mohamed Noor, who is Somali, fatally shot Justine Damond, who is white, after she called to report a possible sexual assault in her neighbourhood. Noor was convicted of third-degree murder and manslaughter and sentenced in 2019 to 12.5 years in prison.“[Noor] got put in prison. But all these other police out here killing these brothers ain’t going nowhere,” 46-year-old Darion Scott, who has lived in Minneapolis for 20 years, told Al Jazeera at Monday’s rally.“This system has been broken for years. The question is, when is it going to stop?”On the opposite side of the government building, a group called Visual Black Justice laid mirrors against trees and next to signs with various messages, such as “Minnesota will be the change” and “It is better to protest than to accept injustice.”Rose petals enclosed a large mirror in the centre of the building’s lawn that read “Reflect”.“We all have a role in white supremacy,” said Tay Elhindi, co-leader of the group. “So we need to reflect and hold ourselves accountable. If we’re not doing that, we can’t hold anybody else accountable.”Protesters also chalked messages on boarded-up windows lining the street.Mimi Vallejo, 25, sat with her two-year-old son as her partner added emphasis to the message “Free the kids in cages” – a reference to children who were held in cages at US immigration detention facilities at the US-Mexico border.“It’s getting to the point where I think our children need to be aware, too,” she said.Vallejo, who immigrated to the US from Mexico as a child, said she grew up fearing injustice from her government only to face the same problem in the US.“That fear has always been there for us,” she said. “As people who are also experiencing, or have experienced oppression and racism from the system, it’s our responsibility to be here … The system that killed George Floyd is the same system that is keeping my relatives down at the border in cages.”",
    "Judge said move of trials of the four ex-police officers likely if lawyers’, officials’ public statements continue.A Minnesota judge on Monday warned that he is likely to move the trials of four former police officers charged in George Floyd’s death out of Minneapolis if public officials and lawyers do not stop talking about the case.Hennepin County Judge Peter Cahill stopped short of issuing a gag order on the lawyers, but he said one is likely if public statements continue. Cahill added that such a situation would also make him likely to grant a change-of-venue motion if one is filed.“The court is not going to be happy about hearing about the case in three areas: media, evidence and guilt or innocence,” Cahill said.It was the second pretrial hearing for the officers, who were fired after Floyd’s May 25 death. Derek Chauvin, 44, is charged with second-degree murder and other counts, while Thomas Lane, 37, J Kueng, 26, and Tou Thao, 34, are charged with aiding and abetting Chauvin.Floyd died after Chauvin, a white police officer, pressed his knee against the handcuffed 46-year-old Black man’s neck for more than eight minutes. The officers were responding to a call about a man trying to pass a counterfeit $20 bill at a nearby store.Floyd’s death was widely condemned in Minnesota, with elected officials including Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey calling for the officers to be charged. Police Chief Medaria Arradondo said Floyd’s death was “murder”.Cahill asked Assistant Attorney General Matthew Frank to use his influence to keep public officials silent, warning that if they continued to discuss it publicly, he likely would “have to pull [trials] out of Hennepin County and they need to be aware of that.”Cahill set a March 8 trial date for the former officers if they are tried together, though he said he expected motions to be filed to separate their trials. The next court date is September 11.The defendants have not entered pleas. Chauvin’s lawyer has not commented publicly on the charges, while Lane’s and Kueng’s lawyers have sought to minimise their clients’ roles and deflect blame to the more senior Chauvin in Floyd’s death, which sparked protests around the world against police brutality.Chauvin remains in custody on one million dollars bail, and Thao is being held on $750,000 bail. Lane and Kueng are free on bond.Cahill also rejected a defence request to reconsider his earlier decision to allow cameras in the courtroom during pretrial proceedings. Defence lawyers asked to allow such coverage, but prosecutors objected. The judge has not ruled on whether to allow cameras for the trial itself, in which Minnesota usually requires the consent of all parties.Kueng’s lawyer, Tom Plunkett, was the lawyer asking Cahill to reconsider his ruling on cameras. He asserted that prosecutors and other officials forfeited their right to object to cameras in the courtroom by making public comments that went as far as “saying the defendants are guilty of murder”. He said allowing electronic coverage of pretrial proceedings would actually make it easier to empanel a fair jury by helping to “educate the public that there may be more to the cases than what has been told to them by the state”.The charges against Chauvin are unintentional second-degree murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Second-degree murder carries a maximum penalty of 40 years in prison; third-degree murder carries up to 25 years and manslaughter up to 10.The other three former officers are charged with aiding and abetting both second-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Those charges are legally tantamount to the counts against Chauvin and carry the same penalties.",
    "Houston said farewell to George Floyd in a rousing hometown funeral on Tuesday, with poignant tributes and calls for justice for the 46-year-old Black man whose death “touched the world” and ignited global protests against police brutality and racism.Politicians, civil rights activists and celebrities joined in sharing memories of the man they called a “gentle giant” after his golden casket was carried into the sanctuary by six pallbearers in masks, as a row of police officers stood at attention and saluted.Civil rights leader Al Sharpton delivered a fierce eulogy, punctuated by the deep chords of a church organ, in which he accused President Donald Trump of showing indifference over Floyd’s death, and sending police a signal of impunity.Acknowledging the presence of the parents of previous victims of police violence – including Eric Garner, Botham Jean and Michael Brown – Sharpton said they “know better than anyone else the pain” of the Floyd family.“Until we know the price for black life is the same as the price for white life, we’re going to keep coming back to these situations over and over again,” the preacher told The Fountain of Praise Church in southern Houston.Though the occasion was solemn, the church echoed with music and words of fond remembrance for a man whose savage death galvanised a movement.“Even in a pandemic, people are walking out in the streets not even following social distancing because you’ve touched the world,” Sharpton said.“And as we lay you to rest today, the movement won’t rest until we get justice.”Floyd died on May 25 as a white Minneapolis officer pressed a knee into his neck for almost nine minutes, his pleas of “I can’t breathe,” becoming a rallying cry for protesters.Some 500 guests, all wearing masks due to the coronavirus pandemic, were at the funeral, including actors Channing Tatum and Jamie Foxx, filmmaker Tyler Perry, singer Ne-Yo and boxing champion Floyd Mayweather who is reportedly paying all expenses.",
    "Minneapolis protesters, undeterred by curfew and National Guard, demand all cops involved in Floyd’s death be charged.Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA – Protesters in at least 12 United States cities defied curfews on Saturday night as outrage over police brutality and the death of George Floyd, an unarmed Black man, escalated.Hundreds of protesters were still out in Minneapolis, Minnesota, where Floyd died in police custody on Monday, amid heavy police and US National Guard presence as an 8pm curfew began on Saturday.“We don’t need a curfew, we need change,” said Mia, a 20-year resident of Minneapolis.Going home would “[send] the wrong message that they can shut us up when they want to, and that’s not the case here”, Mia, who requested her surname be withheld, told Al Jazeera.Protesters have promised to remain in the streets at least until all four officers involved in Floyd’s death have been charged.So far, only one officer – Derek Chauvin – has been arrested in connection to Floyd’s death.Chauvin, who is white, knelt on Floyd’s neck for nearly nine minutes, even as Floyd pleaded “I can’t breathe” and bystanders urged him to get off.On Friday, he was charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter. The three other officers involved – identified as Thomas Lane, Tou Thao and J Alexander Kueng – have not been charged, angering protesters who say they all must be held accountable.Saturday night’s protest started peacefully with protesters chanting “I can’t breathe”, and “no justice, no peace” as they marched down the city’s streets.Meme Green was handing out water, chips, apples and other snacks to protesters with her young son.“He is a Black boy who is going to be a Black man,” Green told Al Jazeera. “He needs to see the protest in a positive way.”But as the curfew began, smoke started appearing on the horizon, with some confrontations between police and protesters.For the first time in state history, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz fully mobilised the National Guard earlier on Saturday in an effort to quell protests which had rocked the city since Tuesday.The National Guard said more than 4,100 citizen-soldiers and airmen had been deployed to the Twin Cities area, which includes Minneapolis.“We are fully-integrated and unified with law enforcement, fire, Emergency Management Systems, and all state agencies to ensure the safety of our citizens,” Major General Jon Jensen said at a news conference late on Saturday.In addition to the National Guard, there was an increased law enforcement presence. Police used tear gas to disperse the crowds, and several arrests were made.But protesters remained undeterred.“It’s absolutely critical that we come together to try to make sure that our babies can grow up in a world where they can walk outside or simply breathe without having to worry about dying,” said Minneapolis resident Ashley Paulson.Similar scenes were seen nationwide and officials called in the National Guard and implemented curfews in an effort to quell protesters.In New York City, several groups of protesters rallied throughout the city. While the protests remained mostly peaceful throughout the day, as the sun set, there were periodic scenes of violence. Police used tear gas and videos showed some protesters being thrown to the ground by officers.Elsewhere, police vehicles and some buildings were set on fire following largely peaceful, but angry protests.Demonstrators are angry not just over Floyd’s death, but years of police killings and violence against unarmed African Americans. That especially rings true in Minnesota.In 2015, protesters rallied for more than two weeks following the police killing of 24-year-old Jamar Clark in Minneapolis. No charges were filed against the officers involved.The next year, 32-year-old Philando Castile was killed by police during a traffic stop in a suburb of Saint Paul, which neighbours Minneapolis. Castile’s girlfriend streamed the aftermath of the shooting live on Facebook. The officer involved was acquitted of manslaughter.Paulson said she has had to have some hard discussions with her five-year-old daughter.“I had to have a conversation with my daughter about the fact that the very people that I was taught were supposed to protect and serve and keep me safe are the very people that she has to be sceptical of,” Paulson said. “I had to teach [that to] my daughter, and it devastated me.”",
    "Thousands stand silent for eight minutes, 46 seconds to remember the man whose killing set off protests across the US.Minneapolis, United States – Eight minutes and 46 seconds of silence. Eight minutes, 46 seconds of prayer. For eight minutes and 46 seconds, thousands in Minneapolis, Minnesota, stood silently with their heads bowed to remember George Floyd, the unarmed Black man killed by police here last week.It was the same amount of time that a white police officer knelt on Floyd’s neck as he cried out: “I can’t breathe.”It was an amount of time that has become a rallying cry across the United States against police brutality and violence against Black people.“That’s a long time,” said Reverend Al Sharpton, who eulogised Floyd on Thursday in Minneapolis.“There’s no excuse. They had enough time, they had enough time,” he told the gathering.“George Floyd’s story has been the story of Black folks. Because ever since 401 years ago, the reason we could never be who we wanted and dreamed to be is you kept your knee on our neck,” he added. “It’s time for us to stand up in George’s name and say, ‘Get your knee off our necks!'”Thursday’s service was the first of several memorials scheduled before Floyd will be buried in Houston, Texas, where he grew up on Tuesday. A weekend memorial is scheduled in North Carolina, where Floyd was born.Philonise Floyd told mourners that his brother was like “a general” and people wanted to follow him.Philonise described George Floyd as a man who made people feel “like the president”. People “wanted to greet him, wanted to have fun with him,” he said.Philonise spoke alongside other members of George Floyd’s family, each remembering Floyd as a kind and good man. Fridays, civil rights leaders, celebrities and politicians listened closely, at times breaking out in applause for what was being said. Thursday’s event was part memorial, part a call to action to end police violence and the culture that many say has led to the deaths of so many African-Americans and other people of colour at the hands of people.“What we saw in that video was evil. So America … as we memorialise George Floyd, do not accept evil,” said Benjamin Crump, a prominent civil rights lawyer who is representing the Floyd family.“Protest against evil. We cannot cooperate with evil. We cannot cooperate with torture,” Crump said.While the memorial was invite-only, thousands of people gathered not far from the site it was held, listening intently to the service on loudspeakers. One person in the crowd described the eight minutes and 46 seconds of silence as a “powerful” moment.“I’m not gonna give up, and we’re not gonna give up until this world changes,” said Zenzele Isoke in the park where the public gathered to listen to the service.“[Floyd’s] spirit is alive in every breath that I draw,” she said. “He’s looking down and he’s with us, so actually we’re closer together now than we’ve ever been.”Mahlet Aschenaki said Thursday’s event was important so people could start to heal.“It’s important for us to come together and grieve because we have been out there cause of our anger, and now it’s important to come together in the grieving process,” Aschenaki said. “I think it’s really good for the community to all be here, show their support and overall just be here for his family.”Floyd’s death, captured on a video seen worldwide, set off mass protests over police and former law enforcement killings of unarmed Black people, including Ahmaud Arbery in Atlanta, Georgia and Breonna Taylor in Louisville, Kentucky.Sharpton announced he and Floyd’s family will lead a march in Washington, DC, on August 28, the 57th anniversary of Martin Luther King Jr’s original March on Washington, which drew hundreds of thousands of people.“We’re going back to Washington,” Sharpton said. “This is the era to deal with policing and criminal justice.”Sharpton’s emotive words came a day after prosecutors announced new charges against the four now-fired officers involved in the death.Derek Chauvin, the officer who knelt on Floyd’s neck, had his previously announced third-degree murder charge upgraded to second-degree murder. He also faces a second-degree manslaughter charge.The other three officers face charges of aiding and abetting second-degree murder and manslaughter. All four are in custody.The charges were one of the key demands of protesters, who have rallied daily for more than a week in cities across the US. But protesters have vowed to continue marching to demand an end to police violence and more systemic reforms.“We don’t have a problem denouncing violence,” Sharpton told mourners on Thursday.“We don’t have a problem denouncing looting … but it seems like some in the criminal justice system have a problem looking at a tape, and knowing there’s probable cause,” he said. “America, this is the time of dealing with accountability in the criminal justice system.”",
    "Michelle Bachelet says US must address ‘deep-seated’ grievances at heart of protests following George Floyd’s killing.The United Nations rights chief has criticised “structural racism” in the United States, urging the country’s leaders to “condemn racism unequivocally” and address the “deep-seated” grievances at the heart of the protests that have broken out in hundreds of cities following the police killing of another Black man.George Floyd died on May 25 after being pinned to the ground by a white police officer in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The officer knelt on Floyd’s neck for nearly nine minutes, even as the unarmed Black man pleaded “I can’t breathe”.Most of the demonstrations that have since spread across the US to denounce police racism have been peaceful. And while there have also been incidents of violence, some officers have been accused of making things worse by employing aggressive tactics that have prompted further allegations of brutality.In a statement on Wednesday, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet cited “credible reports of unnecessary and disproportionate use of force” by US law enforcement officers, including ammunition, tear gas, rubber bullets and pepper balls.“The voices calling for an end to the killings of unarmed African Americans need to be heard. The voices calling for an end to police violence need to be heard. And the voices calling for an end to the endemic and structural racism that blights US society need to be heard,” she said.It came as US President Donald Trump rejected criticism over his use of force to break up a peaceful rally in Washington, DC and pledged to order a military crackdown on protests.Bachelet stressed the need for clear and constructive leadership at this time.“Especially during a crisis, a country needs its leaders to condemn racism unequivocally; for them to reflect on what has driven people to boiling point; to listen and learn; and to take actions that truly tackle inequalities,” she said.The top UN official voiced particular alarm at reports that at least 200 journalists had been attacked or arrested while covering the protests, despite their press credentials being clearly visible.“What has been happening is an unprecedented assault on journalists,” she said, pointing out that “in some cases, they have been attacked or even arrested while on air”.“It is all the more shocking given that freedom of expression and of the media are fundamental principles in the US, central to the country’s identity,” she added. “Reporters must be able to do their important work free from attacks or repression.”Bachelet also expressed deep concerns at statements that have sought to label protesters as “terrorists” or to delegitimise the mass outpouring of grief and peaceful rallies by pointing to violence or destruction of property that has occurred in many locations.“There can be no doubt as to what or who is ‘behind’ these protests. We have seen thousands upon thousands of peaceful protesters, of diverse backgrounds, taking to the streets to demand their rights and to call for change,” she said.Bachelet repeated calls to protesters to express their demands for justice peacefully and for the police to take the utmost care not to inflame the situation through excessive force.",
    "Announcement comes after calls by protesters, activists and Floyd’s family for Keith Ellison to take over case.Minnesota Governor Tim Walz said Sunday that the State Attorney General Keith Ellison would take the lead in any prosecutions related to the death of George Floyd, a Black man who died on Monday after a white officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes as he pleaded that he could not breathe. Walz’s decision to appoint Ellison, who is Black, take the lead comes after requests from activists and protesters, some City Council members and a civil rights group, who said putting the attorney general on the case would send a strong message that justice will be vigorously pursued. Walz said Ellison has the experience needed to lead the prosecution.Ellison said on Friday he that it was “with a large degree of humility and a great seriousness, I accept for my office the responsibility for leadership on this critical case involving the killing of George Floyd.”He added: “We are going to bring to bear all the resources necessary to achieve justice in this case.”It with a large degree of humility and a great seriousness, I accept for my office the responsibility for leadership on this critical case involving the killing of George Floyd. We are going to bring to bear all the resources necessary to achieve justice in this case. pic.twitter.com/XXafzFT0Kd— Attorney General Keith Ellison (@AGEllison) June 1, 2020Earlier Sunday, Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman, who had been leading the case, said that he had asked Ellison to help him in the case, and Ellison agreed they would be full partners.“There have been recent developments in the facts of the case where the help and expertise of the Attorney General would be valuable,” Freeman said. He did not elaborate.But by Sunday evening, Walz said that “unfortunately, our constituents, especially constituents of colour, have lost faith in the ability of Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman to fairly and impartially investigate and prosecute these cases.”Derek Chauvin, the 44-year-old white officer who knelt on Floyd, was charged Friday with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. The three other officers who were involved have not been charged, though Freeman and Ellison have said additional charges are still possible. Chauvin and the three other officers were fired last week.On Sunday, more than 100 people gathered outside Freeman’s demanding the arrests of all four police officers involved in Floyd’s death, and the resignation of Freeman.Community leaders and organisers have told Al Jazeera that they have been calling for Ellison to handle the case, saying there is a history of mistrust between Freeman’s office and members of the community. Walz said Floyd’s family had also requested Ellison take over, saying, “They were very clear they wanted the system to work for them, they wanted to believe that there was trust.”Ellison, who was a US congressman before being elected attorney general, has good ties with the community, organisers have told Al Jazeera. He recently helped lead a state working group on police use of deadly force. ",
    "Throngs converge on Washington, DC in largest protest yet after the death of George Floyd in police custody 12 days ago.Washington, DC – Protesters chanting “Black Lives Matter” and “George Floyd” converged on the United States capital on Saturday thronging the streets from the Capitol building to a barricaded White House and  Lincoln Memorial, to protest the killing of a Black man in police custody, on the 12th day of nationwide protests.Military vehicles and officers in fatigues had closed off much of downtown Washington, DC to traffic, as protesters stirred by the death of George Floyd – who died on May 25 after a white police officer in Minneapolis knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes – flooded the streets chanting and carrying signs including “Get your knee off our necks”.The demonstrators appeared to come from varied racial and ethnic backgrounds, young and old, wearing mandatory masks because of the coronavirus pandemic. Many had children in tow. Floyd’s killing “caused us to rise up and realise we have to do something, we have to say something”, protester Alexis Daniel told Al Jazeera.“Our system is unjust, social injustice still exists today. Our Blacks are being killed, our Blacks are still facing inequality.”The signs held aloft by protesters echoed that.“Justice, value, treatment, equality should not vary by skin color,” one read, another: “How many weren’t filmed?”, implying Floyd’s death might have gone unnoticed if not for the videos detailing the last moments of his life.Some of Floyd’s final words were “Please, I can’t breathe”, and “They’re going to kill me.”The size of the crowds in the capital on Saturday indicated the momentum of demonstrations calling for meaningful change to end racism and police brutality in the US has not dimmed.“I am here to fight for my seven-year-old daughter,” Marie Kelly told Al Jazeera. “The US claims they are this big democracy and everyone has rights, they go to other countries to liberate, prove it here.”The rally followed a week of largely peaceful protests in Washington that at times grew violent, with shops and offices hit by nighttime vandalism and looting, prompting the city’s mayor to impose curfews. The curfews were lifted on Thursday.The White House has been fortified with new fencing and extra security precautions. Most businesses in the downtown area have their windows boarded shut.The protest comes amid a standoff between Washington, DC’s mayor, Muriel Bowser, and President Donald Trump.Before the rally, Bowser on Friday, ordered an enormous “Black Lives Matter” mural painted in large block yellow letters on the street leading to the White House, spanning two blocks. She renamed the section of the street directly in front of the presidential residence “Black Lives Matter Plaza.”Trump has advocated for a militarised response to the civil unrest and summoned a contingent of active-duty troops from other states to the city. As the rally was on going the president tweeted a phrase he has been repeating, “Law and Order”. “This is a rallying point to get his base going,” said Al Jazeera’s Shihab Rattansi, at the demonstration.The Black Lives Matter organisation has objected to the militarisation of the police, driven by military equipment sent to police forces by the US Department of Defense, he said.“If you stop spending billions of dollars on militarising the police, perhaps you’ll get a different attitude, but also you can put all that money into communities,” Rattansi said.Last week, when Trump threatened protesters who come near the White House with “vicious dogs” and “ominous weapons”, Mayor Bowser responded forcefully.“There are no vicious dogs & ominous weapons. There is just a scared man. Afraid/alone. … I call upon our city and our nation to exercise great restraint even while this President continues to try to divide us,” Bowser wrote on Twitter.My police department will always protect DC and all who are in it whether I agree with them (such as those exercising their First Amendment Right) or those I don’t (namely, @realdonaldtrump)…— Muriel Bowser (@MurielBowser) May 30, 2020On Monday, Trump came under fire after baton-swinging federal police fired smoke canisters, flashbang grenades and rubber bullets at a crowd of peaceful protesters to clear the area near the White House so he could pose for a photo-op in front of a church while holding a Bible.Bowser called the scene “shameful”.Trump, for his part, has denounced Bowser as “incompetent”.“The incompetent Mayor of Washington, D.C., @MayorBowser, who’s budget is totally out of control and is constantly coming back to us for ‘handouts,’ is now fighting with the National Guard,” Trump wrote.Breonna Taylor, on your birthday, let us stand with determination. Determination to make America the land it ought to be. pic.twitter.com/XOfu6CGEGY— Mayor Muriel Bowser (@MayorBowser) June 5, 2020 On the newly named plaza, protesters took selfies in front of the large metal fence that keeps them far from the White House. A man standing behind a table handed out water, snacks and paper towels to demonstrators. The few police and security officers in sight wore patrol uniforms rather than body armour and helmets, and had a more relaxed posture than in days prior.The mood across the capital seemed upbeat. The White House said the president had no public events scheduled for Saturday. It was unclear if, behind the new fence, he could hear the crowds filling the city and at one point chanting: “This is what democracy looks like.”",
    "Former Minnesota policeman Derek Chauvin will now face three charges in the death of Floyd.A Minnesota judge granted a request by prosecutors on Thursday to reinstate a charge of third-degree murder against Derek Chauvin, the former Minneapolis police officer who is on trial already facing second-degree murder and manslaughter charges.Chauvin is to be tried for the killing of George Floyd.Judge Peter Cahill’s decision comes after the Minnesota Court of Appeals ruled on Friday that he must reconsider a third-degree murder charge against 44-year-old Chauvin, whose trial got under way with jury selection this week in Minneapolis.“I have to follow the rule that the court of appeals has put in place,” Cahill said, explaining his decision.Chauvin already faces a more serious charge of second-degree murder, which carries a sentence of up to 40 years in prison, as well as a charge of second-degree manslaughter.The reinstatement of a third-degree murder charge was a victory for state prosecutors, who had sought the additional lesser murder charge in part to afford them an extra path to a conviction should the jury find the evidence does not support the most serious charge. The third-degree murder charge carries a sentence of up to 25 years in prison.Hennepin County Judge Peter Cahill based his decision on an earlier killing by a Minneapolis police officer [Court TV/ Pool via AP]Legal experts say the additional charge helps prosecutors by giving jurors one more option to convict Chauvin of murder.The dispute over the third-degree murder charge revolved around the conviction of another former Minneapolis police officer in the unrelated killing of an Australian woman. The appeals court recently affirmed Mohamed Noor’s third-degree murder conviction in the 2017 shooting death of Justine Ruszczyk Damond, and the state used that affirmation to argue that it established a new justification for the charge in Chauvin’s case.Cahill agreed that the precedent has now been established.Chauvin’s charges stem from his actions during the arrest of Floyd on May 25, 2020. Videos show Chauvin, who is white, kneeling on Floyd’s neck for nearly nine minutes on a sidewalk outside a grocery store as the Black man pleaded for his life and then stopped moving. Police were arresting him on suspicion of using a counterfeit $20 bill at the store. Floyd’s death outraged people around the world and helped fuel one of the largest protest movements ever seen in the United States, with daily demonstrations against racism and police brutality.Three other police officers charged in the killing will be tried separately.Jury selection for Chauvin’s trial was set to resume on Thursday morning, with five jurors already seated.Lawyers have given considerable attention to the jury pool’s attitudes towards the police in the first two days of questioning, trying to determine whether they are more inclined to believe testimony from law enforcement over evidence from other witnesses to the fatal confrontation.George Floyd Square has been closed to allow members of the community to mourn the killing of a man last Saturday, on the first day of jury selection in the trial of Derek Chauvin [Nicholas Pfosi/Reuters]The first juror picked on Wednesday, a man who works in sales management and grew up in a mostly white part of central Minnesota, acknowledged saying on his written questionnaire that he had a “very favorable” opinion of the Black Lives Matter movement and a “somewhat unfavorable” impression of the Blue Lives Matter countermovement in favour of the police, yet “somewhat agreed” that police do not get the respect they deserve. He said he agrees that there are bad police officers.“Are there good ones? Yes. So I don’t think it’s right to completely blame the entire organisation,” he told the court under questioning from prosecutor Steve Schleicher.He also said he would be more inclined to believe an officer over the word of another witness. But he said he could set aside any ideas about the inherent honesty of an officer and evaluate each witness on their own.The second, a man who works in information technology security, marked “strongly agree” on a question about whether he believes police in his community make him feel safe. His community was not specified — jurors are being drawn from all over Hennepin County, which includes Minneapolis and many of its suburbs.“In my community, I think when there is suspicious activity the police will stop by, they will ask a question,” he said. “I think that sense of community is all we want, right? We want to live in a community where we feel safe regardless of race, colour and gender.”Schleicher noted that the man also stated in his questionnaire that he strongly disagreed with the concept of “defunding” the police, which has become a political flashpoint locally and across the country in the wake of Floyd’s death.The Hennepin County Government Center in Minneapolis, Minnesota, where the trial for former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin will be held is barricaded [Jim Mone/AP Photo]“While I necessarily might not agree with the police action in some situation, I believe that in order for police to make my community safe they have to have the money,” he replied.The questionnaire explores potential jurors’ familiarity with the case and their own contacts with police. Their answers have not been made public, and the jurors’ identities are being kept secret. Their racial backgrounds often are not disclosed in open court.Chauvin and three other officers were fired. The others face an August trial on aiding and abetting charges. The defence has not said whether Chauvin will testify in his defence.Schleicher used a peremptory challenge on Wednesday to remove from the panel a woman who has a nephew who is a sheriff’s deputy in western Minnesota. She said she was dismayed by the violence that followed Floyd’s death.“I personally didn’t see any usefulness to it,” she said. “I didn’t see anything accomplished by it, except I suppose bring attention to the frustrations of the people involved. But did I see anything useful coming out of the burning of Lake Street and that sort of thing? I did not.”",
    "Protesters say murder charge against one Minneapolis officer not enough; all officers involved must be held accountable.Protesters in the United States city of Minneapolis welcomed Friday’s murder charge against the white officer who knelt on the neck of George Floyd, an unarmed black man, but demanded the three other officers involved be arrested as well.“It’s an absolute outrage because it isn’t just one officer who is responsible for the murder of George Floyd,” said Ayaan Dahir, a Minneapolis resident and activist. “They all need to be arrested and charged.”Floyd died on Monday after policeman Derek Chauvin pinned him to the ground as he repeatedly pleaded: “I can’t breathe.”An eight-minute video of the incident shows bystanders urging Chauvin to get off of Floyd, but the officer continues to pin him down even as he goes motionless. Chauvin, who was fired after the incident, was arrested on Friday, more than three days after Floyd died. He was charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter.According to the charging documents, Chauvin’s knee was on Floyd’s neck for eight minutes and 46 seconds, including nearly three minutes of which Floyd laid on the pavement motionless. “We have evidence, we have the citizen’s camera’s video, the horrible, horrific, terrible thing we have all seen over and over again, we have the officer’s body-worn camera, we have statements from some witnesses,” said Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman in announcing the charges.Three other officers involved were fired but have not been charged, angering protesters and community leaders who have demanded all four officers be held accountable.“The unfortunate situation here is that because police are involved,  the law protects them as well as the system,” said Jaylani Hussein, the director of the Minnesota chapter of Council on American-Islamic Relations.“If they didn’t listen to George’s cries for help, they should have listened to the bystanders who were there witnessing this unfortunate situation,” Hussein told Al Jazeera. “All four need to be arrested and offered no bail.”The killing of Floyd has set off angry protests in Minneapolis and in major cities across the US.Protesters in Minneapolis rallied on Friday night, despite a city-imposed curfew that began at 8pm (01:00 GMT).Some protesters said they will continue to defy the curfew until all the officers involved in Floyd’s death are arrested, local media reported.“They can’t arrest us all,” one protest leader was quoted as saying.The Minnesota Freedom Fund, an organisation that pays bail for low-income individuals who are arrested, encouraged protesters planning to stay past curfew to write the group’s and partner group’s phone numbers on their arms in case of arrest.Friday’s curfew, which will last until 6am (11:00 GMT) on Saturday and begin again later that night, was announced after three nights of protests rocked Minneapolis, with thousands taking to the streets to demand justice for Floyd and an end to police violence.While the protests started peacefully, they descended into chaos, with fires and looting. Police have responded to protesters with tear gas and non-lethal projectiles. Protesters also say police have antagonised them even when they are marching peacefully. At one point a cable television crew was arrested – an incident for which authorities later apologised.On Thursday night, officers retreated from a police precinct as protesters overran the building, chanting, “no justice, no peace”. Some set fires in the building. Protesters rallied outside a different police building on Friday, a livestream by Unicorn Riot, an independent media organisation showed. “It’s very clear that there is a lot of anger, not just about the death of George Floyd, but all the people who have been killed by police,” Dahir told Al Jazeera.Responding to the violence, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz declared a state of emergency and dispatched the National Guard to the city. National Guard members could be seen in Minneapolis and neighbouring Saint Paul by mid-Thursday.In addition to charges brought against all the officers, protesters are also demanding a special prosecutor be named in the case, saying they do not trust Hennepin County Attorney Freeman and pointing to the fact it took more than three days for an arrest to be made.“That arrest of the officer should have happened since day one. And everything that has happened since, I hold Mike Freeman directly responsible,” Dahir said.“What’s been happening – this uprising, this rebellion – is something that organisers have been saying for years was going to happen eventually,” Dahir said. “This isn’t something that can be undone. It’s not an accident, it’s not a coincidence, it is something that has been brewing for a long time and this is the straw that broke the camel’s back.”",
    "Tear gas, rubber bullets, flash bangs fired at peaceful protesters as Trump threatens to deploy military to US states.Washington, DC – Minutes before US President Donald Trump was scheduled to speak from White House Rose Garden on Monday, flash bangs, rubber bullets and tear gas were fired at nearby crowds protesting peacefully against the death of George Floyd, an unarmed Black man who died a week ago after a white officer knelt on his neck for several minutes.As Trump took the podium, declaring he was a “president of law and order”, more tear gas filled the air. “Mayors and governors must establish an overwhelming law enforcement presence until the violence has been quelled,” said Trump, who had temporarily been taken to an underground bunker on Saturday. “If a city or state refuses to take the actions that are necessary to defend the life and property of their residents, then I will deploy the United States military and quickly solve the problem for them.”With the area clear outside the White House, Trump then made an unexpected walk from his residence, across Lafayette Park – where protests against police brutality have taken place for days – and to the historic St John’s Episcopal Church, that was damaged during unrest the night before. He paused for an apparent photo-op, posing with members of his administration, and holding up a Bible. The rare moment came just as a curfew in the nation’s capital took effect. The city’s mayor, Muriel Bowser, moved up the curfew four hours from the previous day’s, when peaceful protests turned violent as the sun fell. Multiple national monuments had been scrawled with graffiti, and several businesses were looted over the course of Sunday evening. Police fired rubber bullets and tear gas at demonstrators who defied that night’s 11pm curfew. Eighteen people were arrested.“The core of it is outrage over George Floyd’s killing in Minneapolis,” said Natalie Hopkinson, an assistant professor in Howard University’s Department of Communication, Culture and Media studies.“You can repair glass, but it’s harder to repair people’s lives,” Hopkinson told Al Jazeera.Katie, who came from Arlington, Virginia, with her friend to clean up the streets around the White House on Monday morning, said picking up rubbish and sweeping up glass was the least she could do.“The protesters who were out risking their lives shouldn’t have to clean up,” Katie, who only wanted to be referred to by her first name, told Al Jazeera, adding that she watched Sunday night’s events on television.“I think the protests should continue until real change is achieved,” she said.Derek Chauvin, the police officer who knelt on Floyd’s neck has been fired and charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Demonstrators are demanding the arrest of the three other officers involved in the incident. An autopsy report released on Monday said Floyd’s death was a homicide. Washington, DC, Police Chief Peter Newsham told reporters on Monday, “the looting and destruction of property was expansive”.Dozens of cities across the US were under similar curfews to the one imposed in Washington, DC, in events that have been likened to the riots following the 1968 assassination of civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr.Late on Monday, Mayor Bowser expressed outrage by the incident outside the White House as Trump spoke. “I imposed a curfew at 7pm,” she tweeted. “A full 25 minutes before the curfew & w/o provocation, federal police used munitions on peaceful protestors in front of the White House, an act that will make the job of @DCPoliceDept officers more difficult. Shameful!”The latest demonstrations also come after weeks of lockdowns due to the coronavirus pandemic, which has killed more than 100,000 Americans, seen tens of millions lose their jobs and has disproportionately affected people of colour, and lower-income communities.“People saw how policymakers responded to the COVID crisis, again following along racial and economic lines,” Hopkins added referring to the disproportionate rate of infections and death among African Americans. “There’s a lot of pent up anger.”Earlier in the day in Lafayette Park, protesters, some carrying signs, gathered while onlookers walked by snapping photos of the graffiti and the charred stone left behind by a fire.“It’s about time for real change in this country,” said Carlton, a resident of Washington who only wanted to be referred to by his first name.He came to withdraw money from the ATM in downtown Washington, but the exterior glass was shattered, and the machine was out of order after it had been spray-painted in red with an expletive against the police.“I am against looting, but what happened [to Floyd] was outrageous,” Carlton said.",
    "Family says it wants world to remember Floyd as a good father, not just for the ‘horrible video’ of his final moments.Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA – Through tears, the mother of George Floyd’s six-year-old daughter, Gianna, made an emotional plea for the world to remember Floyd as a good father and good man, not just a name or a rallying cry.“I wanted everybody to know that this is what those officers took from me,” Roxie Washington said, Gianna standing by her side.“At the end of the day, they get to go home and be with their families,” she added. “Gianna does not have a father. He will never see her grow up, graduate. He will never walk her down the aisle. If there’s a problem she’s having and she needs a dad, she does not have that any more.”Washington’s heartbreaking comments came more than one week after Floyd, an unarmed Black man, died after a white officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes in Minneapolis, Minnesota, setting off mass protests across the United States.A video of the incident shows Floyd repeatedly pleading “I can’t breathe” before going motionless, still under the officer’s knee.“The image that most of us have of George Floyd is the horrible video that we’ve seen,” said Floyd family lawyer, Chris Stewart, alongside Washington and Gianna.“We’ve seen the anger in the streets; we’ve seen so much violence; we’ve seen beauty, also. We’ve seen people standing up and speaking up, and we’ve seen massive changes across the country,” he added. “But what we really wanted the world to see is the beauty of their child. The beauty of Gianna who is going to be taller than me soon, just like her dad. The beauty of Roxie who is holding up strong throughout this. And the actual situations in life that these things affect.”County and private medical examiners have both ruled the autopsy a homicide, but they differed on how Floyd died.The private autopsy, requested by Floyd’s family, found that the 46-year-old died of asphyxiation due to neck and back compression by police, according to the Floyd family lawyers.The Hennepin County Medical Examiner found that Floyd “experienced a cardiopulmonary arrest while being restrained by law enforcement officer(s)”. It said Floyd suffered “other significant conditions”, including heart disease and hypertension, fentanyl intoxication and recent methamphetamine use.All four officers involved in the incident were fired a day after Floyd died.The officer who knelt on Floyd’s neck has since been arrested and charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter.But Floyd’s family, community leaders and protesters want the three other officers involved charged, as well.“I’m here for George because I want justice for him,” Washington said.Earlier on Tuesday, at the intersection where Floyd died, Bishop Harding Smith, remembered Floyd as a giver.“He’s someone that I knew very well, and the love and support you see out here,” Smith told Al Jazeera.“You see, Floyd used to help me outside the Salvation Army feed the homeless,” Smith said.Flowers have grown out of the concrete 38th Street and Chicago Avenue. Signs, cards, candles fill the cracks between the bouquets in the street that have taken over the street as a memorial to Floyd. Protesters gather at the site daily.“I have mixed emotions: hurt, and pain, and disgust,” said Kim Anderson, 56, as she paid her respects.“It’s about time,” she added, speaking about the need for people to come together and get justice.Her call echoed that of Floyd’s family.“I want justice for him,” Washington said. “No matter what anybody thinks, he was good. And this is the proof that he was a good man,” she added, looking at Gianna.Stewart added for every family affected by police brutality, the grief goes much deeper than that of any protest or call.“It’s not just that someone passes and people are angry in the streets,” he said. “It affects people’s actual lives and their futures. A father was taken. A brother and sister lost another brother.” ",
    "Demonstrations have erupted in hundreds of US cities after George Floyd, an unarmed black man, died in police custody.Thousands of protesters from across the United States continue to take to the streets to decry police brutality following the killing of an unarmed Black man, George Floyd, on May 25. National Guard troops, a component of the US Army, have been deployed in at least 23 states to handle the protests.The map and list below shows the locations where protests have occurred and in which states National Guard troops have been deployed. More protests are planned on Tuesday.

    "Judge agreed that the gag order would limit defendants’ ability to defend themselves against negative publicity.A judge in Minnesota on Tuesday lifted a gag order in the criminal case against four former officers charged in the death of George Floyd, but said he would take a news media coalition’s request to make body camera footage more widely available under advisement.Even though the gag order was vacated, Hennepin County District Judge Peter Cahill said he still expects all lawyers involved in the case to follow the rules on disclosure of information. In announcing his ruling, Cahill said he agreed with defence lawyers’ arguments that a gag order would be unfair to their clients and limit their ability to defend themselves against negative publicity.Cahill also ruled Tuesday that he would not hold the lead prosecutor in the case, Attorney General Keith Ellison, in contempt of court as two defence attorneys requested, saying a statement Ellison made when he announced that additional lawyers would be assisting the prosecution was innocuous and did not violate the gag order.Floyd, a Black man who was handcuffed, died May 25 after Derek Chauvin, a white police officer, pressed his knee against Floyd’s neck for nearly nine minutes as Floyd said he could not breathe. Chauvin is charged with second-degree murder, third-degree murder and manslaughter. Three other officers who were at the scene, Tou Thao, Thomas Lane and J Kueng, are charged with aiding and abetting both second-degree murder and manslaughter. All four officers were fired.Police body camera videos were filed with the court this month by Lane’s attorney, Earl Gray, as part of a request to have Lane’s case dismissed. Gray said he wanted the videos to be made public – prompting Cahill to issue an order barring attorneys and parties from discussing the case.Defence lawyers for all four of the former officers asked that the gag order be lifted.Cahill made the videos available for in-person, by-appointment viewing only. Media attorney Leita Walker objected to that format, saying it violated the common law, rules of public access to records and the United States Consitution’s First Amendment, and was essentially equivalent to keeping the videos under seal.Records of all courts are presumed to be open for public inspection with limited exceptions. Prosecutors said that a court may impose restrictions if that access will interfere with the fair and impartial administration of justice, and that reasonable alternatives are not adequate.",
    "There have been six major financial settlements in wake of police killings of Black people since 2015.The $27m settlement made on Friday by the city of Minneapolis for the police killing of George Floyd is the largest won by the family of unarmed Black people killed by police since 2015.Floyd’s death triggered worldwide outrage and nationwide Black Lives Matter protests in the United States that at times turned into violent clashes with police.Here is a list of the financial settlements in such cases to date:A 46-year-old man who was reported for allegedly using a fake $20 bill, Floyd died on May 25, 2020, while handcuffed after a Minneapolis, Minnesota police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes.Settlement: A wrongful death suit filed against Minneapolis resulted in a $27m offer of payment by the Minneapolis City Council on Friday. The family is seeking additional reforms to the police department.A 26-year-old emergency room technician, Taylor was killed on March 13, 2020, by Louisville, Kentucky, police who burst into her home with a battering ram in a raid on the wrong house. Taylor’s boyfriend fired his gun at the intruders who returned fire, killing Taylor.Settlement: Louisville paid $12m to Taylor’s mother and agreed to police department reforms to settle a wrongful death suit.Scott, who was unarmed, was shot in the back while fleeing on foot from a traffic stop in North Charleston, South Carolina, in 2015.Settlement: His family reached a $6.5m settlement with the city of North Charleston.A Black man, Gray died from injuries he sustained while in handcuffs and leg irons after being thrown into the back of a Baltimore police van in 2015.Settlement: His family received $6.4m from the city of Baltimore.A motorist, Castile was shot and killed during a 2016 traffic stop in a suburb of St Paul, Minnesota, after telling police he had a gun in the vehicle. His girlfriend, sitting in the front seat of the car, live-streamed the aftermath of the shooting.Settlement: Castile’s family was awarded $3m. His girlfriend received $800,000 in a separate settlement.Clark was killed by Sacramento, California, police in 2018 after they chased him into his grandmother’s back yard. He was unarmed. Hundreds protested against his killing.Settlement: A judge awarded Clark’s two children $2.4m.",
    "The clips were shown to some media but not released publicly, and reveal the final encounter between Floyd and police.A Minnesota court is investigating how a British newspaper obtained police body-camera footage showing the arrest and death of George Floyd, an unarmed Black man who died after an officer kneeled on his neck for nearly nine minutes in May. The Daily Mail on Monday published parts of videos from cameras being worn by two now-former Minneapolis police officers involved in Floyd’s arrest on May 25 in the United States. A Hennepin County judge last month allowed journalists and members of the public to view the footage by appointment, but has not yet ruled on a motion by a coalition of news organisations seeking public access to the videos.Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, whose office is leading the prosecution of the four fired Minneapolis police officers charged in Floyd’s death, said he was not the source of the leak.“We will continue to take the strictest precautions to ensure a fair trial,” Ellison said in a statement.The newspaper’s article said the videos were leaked to DailyMail.com. The website shows about 10 minutes from former officer Thomas Lane’s bodycam and about 18 minutes from former officer J Kueng’s bodycam.Keung’s body camera shows the officers walking into Cup Foods, where they speak to the owner, who had called them about being paid with counterfeit money. The footage then shows two officers approaching Floyd’s car.One, officer Lane, goes to the driver’s side, and the other, Keung, to the passenger’s side.Lane taps on the driver’s side window – where Floyd is sitting – with a flashlight. Floyd appears initially slow to comply, repeating “I’m sorry, I’m sorry”. Lane is heard yelling “Let me see your hands!” and “Put your [expletive] hands up!”.Within seconds, Lane draws his gun and points it at Floyd, eliciting a look of terror.The officer tells Floyd to put his hands on the wheel. He is again slow to comply before saying “yes, sir” and placing his hands on the wheel.Floyd is heard apologising and saying the situation reminded him of the “last time I got shot”.Floyd begins crying as Lane tells him to get out of the car. “Please don’t shoot me,” Floyd repeats.At one point he says “I just lost my mom, man”. The officers handcuff Floyd, who remains distraught. Keung’s footage shows a handcuffed Floyd sitting on the sidewalk as he asks him identifying questions and tells him that the officers reacted in the way they did because he did not immediately show his hands. Floyd sobs at some points, but remains compliant. Meanwhile, Lane’s camera captures him speaking to the two passengers in the car, asking why Floyd was “being all squirrelly and not showing us his hands and just being weird like that”.Shawanda Hill responds: “Because he’s been shot before”.“He’s got a thing going on,” she adds, pointing to her head and making a circular motion.The officers then attempt to put Floyd into the back of a police car. Floyd refuses, saying “I’m claustrophobic”.At one point he falls down to the ground, but gets back up and still refuses to get back in the car. “Y’all, I am going to die in here,” Floyd says. “I’m going to die, man. I just had COVID, man. I don’t want to go back to that.”The officers finally move Floyd into the back of the vehicle and close the driver’s side door, but Floyd emerges through the passenger side door.At this point, officers Derek Chauvin and Tou Thao have arrived at the scene.Floyd tussles with officers on the passenger side. The struggle ends with him on the ground and officer Chauvin kneeling on his neck. Floyd can be heard repeating, “I can’t breathe” and calling out “Momma”. “Tell my kids I love them. I’m dead,” he is also heard saying.At one point, when Floyd says he can’t breathe, an officer identified by the Daily Mail as Keung is heard telling him “You’re fine. You’re talking fine”.“I’m through … I’m claustrophobic. My stomach hurts. My neck hurts. Everything hurts. I need some water or something, please,” Floyd is also heard saying. An officer identified by the Daily Mail as Chauvin replies: “Then stop talking. Stop yelling. It takes a lot of oxygen to talk.”At one point, an officer identified as Lane asks: “Should we roll him on his side?”Chauvin responds: “No, he’s staying where we’ve got him.”“Okay,” Lane replies. “I just worry about the excited delirium or whatever.”Chauvin replies “Well, that’s why we got the ambulance coming.”Floyd stops moving as Chauvin continues to kneel on his neck.Several people are heard yelling from off camera, some calling for the officers to “check his pulse”. “You call what you’re doing okay?” one man says from off camera. Chauvin has since been charged with second-degree murder, third-degree murder and manslaughter.Lane, Kueng and Thao are charged with aiding and abetting both second-degree murder and manslaughter.All four officers were fired from the department after the incident.",
    "Gesture of support by players of English Premier League club following the death of Black man in US police custody.Liverpool football players took a knee around the centre circle at Anfield Stadium on Monday, in a gesture of solidarity as protests swept the United States following the death of George Floyd, an unarmed Black man, in police custody.Squad members posted a picture of the act on their social media accounts with the caption “Unity is strength #BlackLivesMatter”.The move evoked memories of former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick kneeling during the US national anthem before NFL games in 2016 to protest against police brutality and racial inequality in the US.The picture of 29 players from the English Premier League leaders was taken during a training session.Star players Virgil van Dijk, Trent Alexander-Arnold and captain Jordan Henderson were among those to post the picture that was retweeted by the official account of Liverpool, which is owned by Fenway Sports Group – the US company which also controls the Boston Red Sox.Unity is strength. #BlackLivesMatter pic.twitter.com/sSu2sarAXa— Liverpool FC (@LFC) June 1, 2020Floyd died in Minneapolis on May 25 after a white police officer pressed his knee into the Black man’s neck for several minutes – even after Floyd stopped moving and pleading for air.His death has sparked days of protests across the US and it has resonated in the football world. Four players took a stand over the weekend in Germany’s Bundesliga, which is the first major football league to resume during the coronavirus pandemic.On Sunday, Borussia Dortmund players Jadon Sancho and Achraf Hakimi wore shirts with the message “Justice for George Floyd” in a Bundesliga match.England forward Sancho, who scored the first hat-trick of his career in Dortmund’s 6-1 rout of Paderborn, and the Spanish-born Hakimi, who plays for Morocco, took off their team shirts to display the message.Borussia Moenchengladbach’s Marcus Thuram knelt to honour Floyd after scoring.

Not just the black players, the white players too, everyone. Every player should do it,” Bhandari told the Guardian.“Racism’s not about black players or brown fans, it’s about all of us. Racism corrodes society and we’re all hurt by it. I would urge all the authorities and all the clubs to show a degree of understanding. This is almost above politics, this is about right and wrong.”Manchester United and England striker Marcus Rashford, who is Black, also posted a message on Twitter, saying “people are hurting and people need answers”.“Black lives matter. Black culture matters. Black communities matter. We matter,” Rashford wrote, before adding #justiceforgeorgefloyd.#blacklivesmatter pic.twitter.com/LSEeQ61YRz— Marcus Rashford (@MarcusRashford) June 1, 2020“At a time I’ve been asking people to come together, work together and be united, we appear to be more divided than ever.

    "Mourners from near and far passed through the doors of The Fountain of Praise church in Houston, Texas to view Floyd.The last chance for the public to say goodbye to George Floyd drew thousands of mourners Monday to a church in his native Houston, as his death two weeks ago continues to stoke protests in the US and across the globe and sparked an international debate about racial injustice and police brutality.They lined up for hours to file through the doors of The Fountain of Praise church, which Floyd attended for most of his life, and past the open gold-coloured coffin where he lay dressed in a brown suit. Mourners, many wearing masks and T-shirts with the words “I Can’t Breathe,” stood six feet apart as they paused briefly to view the coffin. Some made the sign of the cross as they passed by. On the stage behind the coffin were two identical murals of Floyd wearing a black cap that read “Houston” and angel wings drawn behind him.“With this happening to him, it’s going to make a difference in the world,” said Pam Robinson, who grew up with Floyd in Houston and handed out bottled water to mourners waiting outside in the searing Texas heat. One man in the line, which had no shade, collapsed as temperatures spiked above 90 degrees and was taken by stretcher to a cooling station set up in front of the church.The mourners came from near and far. Comill Adams told The Associated Press news agency that she drove more than seven hours from Oklahoma City with her family, including two children ages eight and 10. They wore matching black T-shirts with “I Can’t Breathe” on the back – shirts she made up specifically or the memorial.“We had been watching the protests on TV. We’ve been at home feeling outraged. At times, it brought us to tears,” Adams said. “The fact this one is causing change, we had to come be a part of.”Floyd died May 25 after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee into his neck for nearly nine minutes even after Floyd stopped responding. His death has inspired international protests and drawn new attention to the treatment of African Americans by police and the US criminal justice system.Before Floyd’s coffin arrived, workers outside the church assembled a large floral arrangement with white roses on one side in the shape of a heart and with the initials “BLM,” for Black Lives Matter, created from blue roses and placed on top of the heart. The other side of the floral arrangement was made up of red roses and appeared to be in the shape of a raised fist.Republican Texas Governor Greg Abbott was among the first to view the coffin and met the family later. He wore a striped gold and crimson tie, the colours of Floyd’s Houston high school.“George Floyd is going to change the arc of the future of the United States. George Floyd has not died in vain. His life will be a living legacy about the way that America and Texas responds to this tragedy,” Abbott said.Floyd’s funeral will be on Tuesday, followed by burial at the Houston Memorial Gardens cemetery in suburban Pearland, where he will be laid to rest next to his mother, Larcenia Floyd.UPDATE: Tomorrow’s #GeorgeFloyd Houston memorial service will be limited to family and close friends. The public can pay their respects at a public viewing TODAY from 12-6pm CT at Fountain of Praise, 13950 Hillcroft Ave, Houston, TX 77085 pic.twitter.com/AeKeixD3E5— Ben Crump (@AttorneyCrump) June 8, 2020Former Vice President Joe Biden met with Floyd’s family in Houston on Monday and will provide a video message for the funeral service on Tuesday. Previous memorials have taken place in Minneapolis and Raeford, North Carolina, near where Floyd was born.Floyd was raised in Houston’s Third Ward and was a well-known former high school football player who rapped with local legend DJ Screw. He moved to Minneapolis several years ago to seek work and a fresh start. His face now appears on a mural in his old neighbourhood, and his name was chanted by tens of thousands last week at a protest and march in downtown Houston.",
    "The city council voted unanimously to settle the lawsuit brought by Floyd’s family following his death during an arrest last year.The Minneapolis, Minnesota city council voted unanimously on Friday to pay $27m to settle a lawsuit filed by George Floyd‘s family.In July, Floyd’s family sued the city and the four police officers charged in his death last May.The suit alleged the officers violated Floyd’s rights when they restrained him, and that the city allowed a culture of excessive force, racism and impunity to flourish in its police force.Floyd’s sister Bridgett Floyd said in a statement that she and her family were “pleased that this part of our tragic journey to justice for my brother George is resolved”.“While our hearts are broken, we are comforted in knowing that even in death, George Floyd showed the world how to live,” her statement said, according to the Reuters news agency.The Floyd family, led by their lawyer Ben Crump, hold their fists up outside the Hennepin County Family Justice Center during a court hearing for police officers charged in death of George Floyd in Minneapolis, Minnesota, September 11, 2020 [File: Nicholas Pfosi/Reuters]Ben Crump, the Floyd family’s lawyer, said, “It’s not just enough for America to say that George Floyd’s life matters. We have to show that George for life matters by actions, is not just enough for America to say that Black lives matter. We have to show that Black lives matter by our actions.”“We applaud this responsible city leadership and we urge everybody to practise responsible leadership in remaining calm and engaging in peaceful protests for George Floyd,” Crump added.Al Jazeera’s John Hendren, reporting from Chicago, called it “one of the largest settlements you could find. But the family says they aren’t just looking for a monetary settlement.” Hendren reports the family wanted reforms and justice in the cases of the four officers accused in Floyd’s death.“The settlement is not just historic because of the $27 million paid out, but for the impact on social justice policy reforms and police reforms … that affect all of us,” Crump said.“This is a deeply traumatic event that, unfortunately, is a part of too many Black and brown families’ realities,” Council Vice President Andrea Jenkins said after the vote, according to the Minneapolis Star Tribune.“There is no amount of money that can replace a brother, a son, a nephew, a father, a loved one but what we can do is continue to work towards justice and equity and equality in the city of Minneapolis and that’s what I commit to do,” Jenkins continued.Protesters gather at a memorial for George Floyd where he died outside Cup Foods on East 38th Street and Chicago Avenue in Minneapolis, June 1, 2020 [File: John Minchillo/AP Photo]The $27m settlement also includes a $500,000 contribution from the Floyd family to the neighbourhood where Floyd died.Floyd, a 46-year-old Black man, died on May 25 after officer Derek Chauvin, who is white, kneeled on his neck for nearly nine minutes while Floyd pleaded “I can’t breathe” and bystanders implored the officers to let him go.Along with Chauvin, two other officers held Floyd to the ground while he was handcuffed. Floyd was arrested on suspicion of his using a counterfeit $20 bill to buy cigarettes at a Minneapolis grocery store.Floyd’s death sparked protests in Minneapolis and across the US and led to a nationwide reckoning on racial justice.The settlement comes as jury selection continues in the trial of Chauvin, who was fired from the police force and faces charges of third-degree murder, second-degree murder and manslaughter charges. Opening arguments in his trial are expected to begin later this month.The three other officers involved in Floyd’s killing, Tou Thao, Thomas Lane and J Alexander Kueng were also fired and are expected to go on trial together in August. They are charged with aiding and abetting murder and manslaughter.",
    "A judge ruled the public may view the police footage by appointment, a move critics say is equal to keeping it sealed.Video footage from the body cameras of two officers charged in George Floyd‘s alleged murder is being made available for public viewing by appointment on Wednesday, but a judge thus far has declined to allow news organisations to publish the footage for wider distribution.Footage from the body cameras of Thomas Lane and J Kueng was filed with the court last week by Lane’s lawyer, but only the written transcripts were made public. A coalition of news organisations and attorneys for Lane and Kueng has said making the videos public would provide a more complete picture of what happened when Floyd was taken into custody.The viewing will take place on the same day Floyd family lawyer, Ben Crump, will announce a lawsuit against the city and the police officers involved in his death.Members of the media and the public will view the video on Wednesday by appointment at the court.The media coalition has said this arrangement is the equivalent of keeping the videos under seal, and the coalition is asking Judge Peter Cahill to allow the media to copy the videos and publish them. Cahill has not said why he is not allowing the footage to be disseminated more widely.Media lawyer Leita Walker said in a court filing the footage should be made widely available to “all members of the public concerned about the administration of justice in one of the most important, and most-watched, cases this State – perhaps this country – has ever seen”.She also said allowing journalists to copy the footage, watch it multiple times, transcribe it and compare it with the transcripts and to time stamps from a circulating bystander video will help reporters piece together a more complete story.“As the days of unrest in the Twin Cities showed, it is vitally important that the public have full confidence in the process and outcome of this criminal prosecution,” she said.Floyd, a Black man who was handcuffed, died on May 25 after Derek Chauvin, a white police officer, pressed his knee against Floyd’s neck for nearly nine minutes as Floyd repeatedly said he could not breathe.Chauvin has been charged with second-degree murder, third-degree murder and manslaughter. Tou Thao, Lane and Kueng have been charged with aiding and abetting both second-degree murder and manslaughter. All four officers have been fired.The body camera videos and transcripts were filed in court last week by Lane’s lawyer, Earl Gray, as part of a motion to have Lane’s case dismissed.Gray said at the time he wanted the videos to be made public, telling the Star Tribune they would show the “whole picture”. Gray said the bystander video shows just the last piece of what happened and “is not fair”.Gray’s motion highlighted portions of the body camera video that show Floyd “actively resisting and acting erratic” with officers. It also noted Floyd’s “request” to be put on the ground. Gray also argued that Lane did not have a clear view of what Chauvin was doing.Kueng’s lawyer, Tom Plunkett, said in a court filing he also wants the videos made public. He said releasing information in piecemeal fashion has been catastrophic, leading to incomplete reporting by the media and unfairly portraying evidence in favour of the prosecution.The footage could provide a more vivid picture of what happened the night Floyd was arrested on suspicion of passing a fake $20 bill.The transcripts show Floyd appearing cooperative at times but becoming agitated as he begged not to be put in a squad car, saying repeatedly he was claustrophobic. The transcripts also detailed Floyd thrashing about in the back of the squad car to the point where he injured himself.The footage will likely also show what Lane, Kueng and Floyd did during the struggle, rather than what was merely said. It could also pick up on nonverbal cues that are not captured in the transcripts, such as laboured breathing, tone of voice or physical reactions.The video could also show what Chauvin was saying and doing, and how much Lane and Kueng saw. It could also dispel some discrepancies in the two transcripts that Walker, the media lawyer, said raise questions about their accuracy.Floyd’s family plans to unveil a lawsuit against the city of Minneapolis on Wednesday, the same day the footage becomes publicly available. ",
    "Minneapolis protesters demand all officers involved in the unarmed Black man’s death be held accountable.Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA – One week after George Floyd, an unarmed Black man, died after a white officer knelt on his neck, protesters in Minneapolis, Minnesota, say “nothing has changed” regarding how Black people are treated by police.“They are willing to arrest thousands to avoid arresting four people,” said Ahnor Kelly, 25, who rallied with thousands of others outside the Minnesota governor’s residence late on Monday.“They’re willing to use more tax money to bring out the national guard than to give people health equity, such as protective gear and testing,” Kelly told Al Jazeera.In the week since Floyd’s death on May 25, prosecutors have decided to charge only one officer – Derek Chauvin – who knelt on Floyd’s neck for nearly nine minutes, during more than two minutes of which, video showed, Floyd lay motionless. Chauvin was charged on Friday with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter.But protesters, Floyd’s family and community leaders want the other three officers involved to be arrested as well.“In the next 10 minutes, we want Governor Tim Walz and the chief of police to arrest the rest of the officers,” said one speaker at Monday’s rally at the governor’s residence in St Paul, which neighbours Minneapolis.Kelly added that “this [mass protests] will stop if they arrest those four officers” but “until they do that, this is going to continue to happen.”Monday’s rally came just hours after separate autopsy reports released by independent and county medical examiners agreed in ruling Floyd’s death was a homicide, but they differed in part on the cause.The private autopsy, obtained by Floyd’s family, found that the 46-year-old died of asphyxiation due to neck and back compression by police, according to the Floyd family lawyers.The Hennepin County Medical Examiner found that Floyd “experienced a cardiopulmonary arrest while being restrained by law enforcement officer(s)”. It said Floyd suffered “other significant conditions”, including heart disease and hypertension, fentanyl intoxication and recent methamphetamine use.“[We] don’t need a doctor to tell us that you know you clearly saw it on TV,” said Justin Pritchard, who attended Monday’s demonstration.Floyd’s death has sparked worldwide protests in solidarity with the demonstrators out in more than 120 US cities, according to an Al Jazeera tally.Although the protests have at times descended into violence with looting, vandalism and fires, especially as night falls and curfews kick in, they have remained largely peaceful, characterised by loud, unified chants of some of Floyd’s last words “I can’t breathe”, and “no justice, no peace”.Still, National Guard troops have been called in, thousands of arrests have been made, and police have responded with tear gas, rubber bullets, and flashbangs, including on many demonstrating peacefully.More than 2,000 gathered outside the Minnesota governor’s residence on Monday evening, listening to speakers and community leaders.“If you never stop fighting, guess what will happen eventually?” asked Mel Reeves, a journalist and activist, of the crowd.“We will win,” he said.The protesters then marched through the streets, chanting “Say his name! George Floyd!” and “What do we want? Justice!”“I’m sad for my city,” said Minneapolis resident Brendon Smith, who also marched for Philando Castile and for his “best friend” Jamar Clark, both unarmed Black men killed by police in Minnesota in recent years.Justin Pritchard, 35, who used to live near the intersection where Floyd died, said that as a Black man, he has had to rethink even doing the simplest of tasks.“I don’t even want to exchange money any more cause that could have happened to me, you know. Somebody could have gave me a fake $20,” Prichard said, referring to the fact Floyd was stopped by police for allegedly attempting to use a counterfeit $20 bill.Pritchard agrees that not much has changed in the week since Floyd’s death, but he remains hopeful.“It’s great, all the support,” he told Al Jazeera. “But as far as change, I don’t think much has changed now, but I’m optimistic that it will.”",
    "Citing safety concerns, the judge allowed Derek Chauvin to live in a neighbouring state while he awaits trial.A judge in the United States state of Minnesota cited safety concerns Friday as he issued new bail conditions for an ex-Minneapolis police officer charged in the death of George Floyd that would allow him to live in a neighbouring state while he awaits trial.Derek Chauvin posted $1m bond on Wednesday and was allowed to leave the maximum security state prison where he had been held since shortly after his arrest.Hennepin County District Judge Peter Cahill said the Minnesota Department of Corrections, which is supervising Chauvin while he is on release, presented evidence in private “supporting safety concerns that have arisen”.The order did not say what that evidence entailed.Floyd died on May 25 after Chauvin pressed his knee on his neck for several minutes as the handcuffed Black man pleaded for air.His death, which was captured on video and shared online, prompted mass protests against police violence and anti-Black racism across the US and around the world over the past several months.Demonstrators march through south Minneapolis after former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, who is charged with George Floyd’s murder, posted bail [Nicholas Pfosi/Reuters]Chauvin was later charged with second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter.The ex-officer’s release from prison triggered two nights of protests in Minneapolis and Saint Paul this week, and prompted Governor Tim Walz to mobilise US National Guard troops and state law enforcement officers.Three other sacked former police officers, who also face charges in relation to Floyd’s death, were released on bond earlier. Their trial is set for March.Chauvin’s previous conditions prohibited him from leaving Minnesota without court permission and ordered him to sign extradition waivers if he was released.Under the new conditions, he “must establish residency somewhere in the State of Minnesota or a contiguous state as soon as possible” and report it to his supervising officer.His address will be shared with local law enforcement, but must be kept confidential.The former officer must also carry a mobile phone and keep it on, charged and in range so that the department of corrections can reach him at all times. He must also surrender his passport.Cahill’s order said the defence and prosecution had agreed to the new terms.",
    "Demonstrations erupt in major cities as thousands defy Minneapolis curfew to protest against unarmed Black man’s death.Protests have broken out in cities across the United States calling for justice following the death of George Floyd in police custody when a white officer in Minneapolis pressed a knee into the unarmed Black man’s neck for several minutes.In scenes both peaceful and violent across the country, thousands of protesters on Friday chanted “no justice, no peace” and “say his name. George Floyd.” They hoisted signs reading: “He said I can’t breathe. Justice for George.”The demonstrations came as Derek Chauvin, the officer involved in Floyd’s death, was arrested and charged with one count each of third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter.Graphic video footage taken on an onlooker’s cellphone and widely circulated on the internet shows Floyd – with Chauvin’s knee pressed into his neck – gasping for air and repeatedly groaning, “Please, I can’t breathe,” while a crowd of bystanders shouted at police to let him up.The video reignited an outpouring of rage that civil rights activists said has long simmered in Minneapolis, the largest city in the state of Minnesota, and other towns and cities across the country over persistent racial bias in the US criminal justice system and the deaths of Black people in police custody.The charges brought by Hennepin County prosecutors came after a third night of protests in which protesters set fire to a police station, and the National Guard was deployed to help restore order in Minneapolis. Authorities had hoped Chauvin’s arrest would allay public anger and avert continued unrest. But defying an 8pm curfew imposed by Mayor Jacob Frey, thousands took to the streets for a fourth night. A heavy contingent of National Guard, state troopers and police moved in, some on foot and some in vehicles.The fires have begun in Minneapolis pic.twitter.com/9UCVGJHYH8— John Hendren (@johnhendren) May 30, 2020“We saw a confrontation between a number of demonstrators and state police … [that] ended with tear gas,” Al Jazeera’s John Hendren, reporting from Minneapolis, said. Protester Naeema Jakes told AFP news agency she needed to be on the streets so she could verbally confront officers.“I need you to look in my eyes and feel me,” Jakes said. “This is pain, this is hurt.”Some cars were set on fire in scattered neighbourhoods, while a pair of restaurants and a Wells Fargo branch were also set ablaze. Among the cities with larger protests on Friday were Atlanta, Denver, Detroit, Houston, Los Angeles and Louisville.After hours of peaceful protest in central Atlanta, some demonstrators turned violent, smashing police cars, setting one on fire, spray-painting the logo sign at CNN’s headquarters and breaking into a restaurant. The crowd pelted officers with bottles, chanting “quit your jobs”.Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms pleaded with the crowd to go home.“This is not a protest,” she said. “You are disgracing our city. You are disgracing the life of George Floyd and every other person who has been killed in this country. We are better than this.”But the violence continued, prompting Georgia’s Governor Brian Kemp to declare a state of emergency to “protect people & property in Atlanta”.Kemp said 500 members of the state National Guard would be deployed to quell the unrest.Protesters also gathered outside the White House, with President Donald Trump inside, and some tried to push through barriers set up by the US Secret Service along Pennsylvania Avenue.In New York City, an initially peaceful demonstration spiralled into chaos as night fell. Protesters skirmished with officers, destroying police vehicles and setting fires.In Brooklyn, activists who had marched from Manhattan chanted slogans against police brutality and pelted officers lined up outside the Barclays Center with water bottles. Police sprayed an eye-irritating chemical into the largely diverse crowd multiple times, then cleared the plaza.Numerous people were arrested and police brought in buses to carry them off.“We have a long night ahead of us in Brooklyn,” Mayor Bill de Blasio tweeted. “Our sole focus is deescalating this situation and getting people home safe. There will be a full review of what happened tonight. We don’t ever want to see another night like this.”In Houston, where Floyd grew up, several thousand people rallied in front of City Hall. Among them was 19-year-old Jimmy Ohaz, who came from the nearby city of Richmond, Texas.“My question is how many more, how many more? I just want to live in a future where we all live in harmony and we’re not oppressed,” he told The Associated Press news agency.In Detroit, a 19-year-old man was killed after someone in a vehicle fired shots into a crowd of people protesting Floyd’s death. Police said an officer was not involved in the shooting and the suspect had pulled up in a Dodge Durango and opened fire at the protesters.Tensions also rose in several cities on the US’s west coast as night fell and protesters blocked highways in Los Angeles and Oakland. Demonstrators in Los Angeles scuffled at times with police, with a few protesters arrested and one officer receiving medical treatment, police said.The unrest was the worst the US has seen in years. The AP news agency, citing three anonymous sources said the Pentagon ordered the army to put military police units on alert to head to Minneapolis on short notice at Trump’s request.Trump said on Friday he had spoken to Floyd’s family and “expressed my sorrow”. He called the video of the arrest “just a horrible thing to witness and to watch. It certainly looked like there was no excuse for it”.Earlier in the day, Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman said a key piece of evidence in the case against Chauvin was the video clip showing Floyd lying face down in the street, with the officer kneeling on the back of Floyd’s neck – Chauvin had his knee on Floyd’s neck for nearly nine minutes, according to an autopsy report.“We have evidence, we have the citizen’s camera’s video, the horrible, horrific, terrible thing we have all seen over and over again,” Freeman said.He added the investigation into Chauvin, who faces up to 25 years in prison if convicted, was ongoing and he anticipated also charging the three other officers, identified by the city as Thomas Lane, Tou Thao and J Alexander Kueng.All four were fired from the police department on Tuesday after the video surfaced of Monday’s arrest.  The 46-year-old Floyd’s relatives welcomed the news of Chauvin’s arrest as a “step on the road to justice”. But they said they hoped for tougher charges and action against the other officers involved in Floyd’s detention and death. “We want a first-degree murder charge. And we want to see the other officers arrested,” they said in a statement.“The pain that the Black community feels over this murder and what it reflects about the treatment of Black people in America is raw and is spilling out onto streets across America.”",
    "The measure would cut nearly $8m from the $179m policing budget and redirect it to other programmes in the United States city.Minneapolis City Council members who tried unsuccessfully to dismantle the police department in response to George Floyd‘s death are set to vote Wednesday on whether to shrink it, a move that could imperil the entire city budget because the mayor is threatening to use his veto to protect public safety amid soaring crime rates.The plan, which supporters call “Safety for All”, is the latest version of the “defund the police” movement that Minneapolis and other United States cities have considered since Floyd’s May 25 death in police custody ignited mass demonstrations against police brutality and a nationwide reckoning with racism.Eleven of the 13 council members have already cast committee votes in favour of the largest parts of the plan, signalling that passage is likely. It would cut nearly $8m from Mayor Jacob Frey’s $179m policing budget and redirect it to mental health teams, violence prevention programmes and other initiatives.Protesters gather outside of the Hennepin County Family Justice Center while a court hearing on the case of the death of George Floyd proceeds inside, in Minneapolis, Minnesota, the US [File: Nicholas Pfosi/Reuters]“I am actively considering a veto due to the massive, permanent cut to officer capacity,” Frey said in a statement on Monday night. Reducing the authorised size of the force by 138 officers before enacting alternatives is “irresponsible”, he said.Cities around the US, including Los Angeles, New York City and Portland, Oregon, are shifting funds from police departments to social service programmes in an effort to provide new solutions for problems traditionally handled by police. Such cuts have led some departments to lay off officers, cancel recruiting classes or retreat from hiring goals.In Minneapolis, violent crime rates have surged since the death of Floyd, a Black man who was handcuffed and pleading for air for several minutes while Derek Chauvin, a white former officer, pressed his knee against his neck. Chauvin and three others were charged in Floyd’s death and are expected to stand trial in March.Protestors face off against police during a protest in Florissant, Missouri, the US [File: Lawrence Bryant/Reuters]“This summer happened because George Floyd was murdered by the Minneapolis Police Department and it wasn’t an accident; it’s because the system of policing we know now is not just racist, but it doesn’t create safety for all,” said Oluchi Omeoga, a cofounder of the Black Visions Collective, which supports “Safety for All” as a step toward more transformational change.Due to austerity forced by the coronavirus pandemic, the police department is already facing a $14m cut compared with its original 2020 budget.Mayor Frey aims to hold the number of sworn officers around 770 through 2021 with hopes of eventually increasing the force to its current authorised cap of 888. “Safety for All” would cap the number at 750 by 2022. The department is already down by about 120 officers – partly due to members of the police force claiming post-traumatic stress disorder from a summer of unrest – with more preparing to leave amid retirements and poor morale.Passions ran hot on both sides as more than 400 citizens signed up to speak during a marathon hearing last week that ran into the early hours Thursday, with many expressing alarm that the council was even contemplating cuts.“I think we need to make bold decisions on a path forward,” said Council Member Steve Fletcher, a co-author of the proposal. While acknowledging that it would mean fewer officers, he defended the plan by saying it would reduce the department’s workload by shifting 911 calls away from armed officers to other specialists such as mental health professionals.A memorial to George Floyd in Minneapolis, Minnesota, the US [Nicholas Pfosi/Reuters]On the other side are those like Frey and Police Chief Medaria Arradondo, who say there is no need for an either-or decision and that it is possible to reform policing without cutting officers. The mayor and 12 of the 13 council members are Democrats, while one council member is from the Green Party.If the council approves the plan on Wednesday, Frey would have five days to veto if he chooses. The council could override him with a two-thirds majority, or nine council members, but it’s not clear whether those nine votes exist. The proposal to cap the number of officers passed with just 7 of 13 votes in committee on Monday.A proposal over the summer to dismantle the department and replace it with a “Department of Community Safety and Violence Prevention” initially had support from a majority of the council, but faltered when a separate city commission voted against putting it on the November ballot. The city was paying $4,500 a day at one point for private security for three council members who reported getting threats after supporting defunding.",
    "Derek Chauvin’s trial is delayed until Tuesday, at least, as an additional murder charge is considered.The trial of former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin for the death of George Floyd was delayed until at least Tuesday morning as the judge contended with a last-minute order by a higher court to reconsider adding the murder charge.The trial had been scheduled to begin on Monday with the screening of jurors to weigh murder and manslaughter charges in a case seen as a referendum on police violence against Black Americans.Judge Peter Cahill of the Hennepin County district court set aside three weeks for jury selection alone, mindful of the difficulties finding impartial Minneapolitans in a case that has convulsed a nation and in which an image of the victim — a selfie of Floyd faintly smiling — has become an international icon of racial justice.But that was delayed by the Minnesota Court of Appeals, which ordered Cahill to reconsider prosecutors’ request to also reinstate a third charge, third-degree murder.People hold signs as they gather outside the Hennepin County Government Center on the first day of the trial of former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, March 8, 2021 [Leah Millis/Reuters]Eric Nelson, Chauvin’s lead lawyer, told the court on Monday morning that Chauvin would soon ask the Minnesota Supreme Court to overturn Friday’s order, a process that could take weeks. Prosecutors from the Minnesota attorney general’s office urged the court to delay jury selection until that issue was resolved.“We’re not doing this to interfere, to slow this down, but it is a very important matter,” Matthew Frank, an assistant attorney general, told the court. Prosecutors feared picking a jury when the number of charges was still unresolved could make it easier for Chauvin to appeal a verdict later, Frank said.Cahill declined. Prosecutors then said they would ask the Appeals Court to intervene to delay the trial. Cahill suspended the proceedings until Tuesday morning.Chauvin, 44, is charged with second-degree murder, which carries a sentence of up to 40 years in prison, and manslaughter.Chauvin was released from jail on a $1m bond last October and will be tried in a court in the Hennepin County Government Center, a tower in downtown Minneapolis now ringed with fencing and concrete barricades for fear of disruption by protesters.Members of the National Guard stand guard in front of the Hennepin County Government Center on the first day of the trial of former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, March 8, 2021 [Leah Millis/Reuters]He appeared in court dressed in a navy blue suit and tie, a white shirt and a black face mask and jotted notes in a yellow legal pad on the table before him.Small groups of protesters gathered by the barricades at an adjoining park, some arriving with bouquets of flowers and signs daubed with optimistic slogans: “A change is coming.” A few volunteers set up tables, handing out donated coffee and doughnuts.The courtroom has been adapted to mitigate the spread of the novel coronavirus, and Judge Peter Cahill has sharply limited attendance inside: the families of Chauvin and Floyd have each been allocated a single seat inside the courtroom, and most reporters attending must watch a video stream in a building across the street.Lawyers for Chauvin, who was fired from the police force the day after Floyd’s death, have argued that he correctly followed his training in helping colleagues arrest Floyd on suspicion of using a counterfeit $20 bill at the Cup Foods grocery store. A handcuffed Floyd can be seen in videos struggling against being placed in a police vehicle complaining he has claustrophobia.The medical examiner ruled that Floyd’s death was a homicide caused partly by police restraint holds. But the autopsy report also noted that Floyd had recently ingested the opioid fentanyl, and Chauvin’s lawyers contend that an overdose was the main cause of death.",
    "Tens of thousands of demonstrators rallied in Washington, DC, and other US cities on Saturday, demanding an end to racism and brutality by law enforcement, as protests sparked by the police killing of George Floyd stretched into the 12th day.A Lincoln Memorial rally and march to the White House marked the largest outpouring yet of protests nationwide since video footage emerged showing Floyd, an unarmed Black man in handcuffs, lying face down and struggling to breathe as a white police officer knelt on his neck.“It feels like I get to be a part of history and a part of the group of people who are trying to change the world for everyone,” said Jamilah Muahyman, a Washington resident at a demonstration near the White House.Floyd’s May 25 death has sparked a storm of protests in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, thrusting the highly charged debate over racial justice back to the forefront of the political agenda five months before the November US presidential election.An almost festive atmosphere prevailed among protesters assembled at an outdoor strip newly rechristened Black Lives Matter Plaza – the phrase “Black Lives Matter” painted in large yellow letters on the pavement – a block from the White House.It was near the spot where US Park Police and military personnel cleared Lafayette Square of peaceful demonstrators with chemical spray and smoke grenades on Monday night, so President Donald Trump could walk from the White House through the park to a church to hold a bible aloft for cameras.On Saturday, Washington, DC, Mayor Muriel Bowser, a vocal critic of Trump’s response to the protests this week, was spotted in the crowd while songs such as “Sweet Caroline” by Neil Diamond and “Alright” by Kendrick Lamar blared from loudspeakers.",
    "Release comes with conditions banning Derek Chauvin from working in law enforcement and possessing any firearms.The former Minneapolis police officer charged with murder in the death of George Floyd has posted bail and was released from prison on Wednesday.According to court documents, Derek Chauvin posted $1m bail, and the Department of Corrections confirmed he was no longer in custody at the state’s facility in Oak Park Heights, where he had been detained. Hennepin County jail records show he was released shortly before 11:30am (16:30 GMT).A memorial to George Floyd in Minneapolis, Minnesota [Nicholas Pfosi/Reuters]Floyd, a Black man in handcuffs, died May 25 after Chauvin, who is white, pressed his knee against Floyd’s neck for several minutes as Floyd said he could not breathe. Floyd’s death was captured in widely seen bystander video that set off protests around the world. Chauvin and three other officers were fired.Chauvin is charged with second-degree murder, third-degree murder and manslaughter; Thomas Lane, Alexander Kueng and Tou Thao are charged with aiding and abetting both second-degree murder and manslaughter.It was not immediately clear where Chauvin got the money to pay his bond. The Minnesota Police and Peace Officers Association, which has a legal defence fund, did not provide any money for bail, a spokeswoman said.

Under the conditions of his release, he must attend all court appearances, cannot have any direct or indirect contact – including social media – with any members of Floyd’s family, cannot work in law enforcement or security, and surrendering firearms.The other three officers previously posted bail amounts of $750,000 and have been free pending trial. Currently, all four men are scheduled to face trial together in March, but the judge is weighing a request to have them tried separately.",
    "Judge rules that Derek Chauvin, the former police officer who held his his knee on Floyd’s neck, will be tried alone.Derek Chauvin the white police officer who held his knee on the neck of George Floyd for several minutes will be tried separately from the three other former officers accused in his death, according to scheduling court orders filed on Tuesday.Chauvin will stand trial alone in March due to the coronavirus pandemic while the other three former officers will be tried together in the summer, according to the orders filed in Hennepin County District Court.Floyd, a Black man, died on May 25 after Chauvin pressed his knee against Floyd’s neck while he was handcuffed face down on the street in Minneapolis. Police were investigating whether Floyd used a counterfeit $20 bill at a nearby store. In a video widely seen on social media, Floyd could be heard pleading with officers for air, saying he could not breathe.Floyd’s death sparked protests in Minneapolis and elsewhere and renewed calls for an end to police brutality and racial inequities.Chauvin is charged with second-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter in Floyd’s death. Former officers Tou Thao, J Alexander Kueng and Thomas Lane are each charged with aiding and abetting second-degree murder, as well as aiding and abetting second-degree manslaughter.Floyd, a Black man, died on May 25 after Chauvin pressed his knee against Floyd’s neck while he was handcuffed face down on the street in Minneapolis [Nicholas Pfosi/Reuters]Judge Peter Cahill cited the limitations of physical space during the coronavirus pandemic for his order to split the defendants’ trials. It is “impossible to comply with COVID-19 physical restrictions” given how many lawyers and support personnel that four defendants say would be present, Cahill wrote.Last week, prosecutors asked Cahill to postpone the March 8 trial to June 7 to reduce public health risks associated with COVID-19. In his order Tuesday, the judge wrote that while the pandemic situation may be greatly improved by June, “the Court is not so optimistic given news reports detailing problems with the vaccine roll-out.”Cahill cited a request from Chief Judge Toddrick Barnette after last week’s hearing to reconsider having all four defendants tried in March due to space concerns. Barnette wrote that in his view that the courtroom could handle up to three defendants at once.Defence attorneys had argued last year that the officers should be tried separately since each officer might seek to diminish their own role in Floyd’s arrest and death by pointing fingers at the other officers. Prosecutors had argued against dividing the trial, saying the evidence against all four is similar, the officers acted together and the public and witnesses should be spared the trauma of multiple trials.Thao, Kueng and Lane are now scheduled to stand trial together beginning August 23.",
    "Legal team of George Floyd’s family asks for his body after coroner raises doubts about suffocation as cause of death.The family lawyers of George Floyd, an unarmed Black man who died in US police custody, have requested his body for an independent autopsy after the county coroner raised doubts about suffocation as the cause of death.The 46-year-old died on Monday after Derek Chauvin, a white officer in Minneapolis, pinned his neck down to the ground with his knee for nearly nine minutes. His death has sparked protests demanding justice across the United States.The Hennepin County medical examiner said the combined effects of being restrained, potential intoxicants in the 46-year-old’s system and his underlying health issues, including heart disease, likely contributed to his death. It revealed nothing to support strangulation as the cause of death.There were no other details about intoxicants, and toxicology results can take weeks.In response to the preliminary autopsy findings, Benjamin Crump, one of the lawyers representing Floyd’s family, said the legal team would hire Michael Baden, the former chief medical examiner of New York City, to do the independent autopsy. Baden had also been retained to do an autopsy for Eric Garner, a Black man who died in 2014 after New York police placed him in a chokehold and he pleaded that he could not breathe.AUTOPSY STATEMENT: The legal team representing the family of George Floyd has issued the following statement related to the preliminary autopsy findings by the Hennepin County Medical Examiner. #GeorgeFloyd #SayHisName #JusticeForGeorgeFloyd #JusticeForGeorge #JusticeForFloyd pic.twitter.com/2szasXwiz8— Ben Crump (@AttorneyCrump) May 30, 2020Crump said the preliminary findings were part of a pattern also seen in previous cases of deaths at the hands of police.“We saw in the Eric Garner case, and so many other cases where they have people who work with the city workers come up with things that are such an illusion – he had asthma, he had a heart condition – all these things that are irrelevant when they were living, breathing, walking, talking, just fine until the police accosted them,” Crump said.A bystander video of Monday’s incident shows Floyd pleading for help, repeatedly saying: “I can’t breathe.” Floyd eventually goes motionless, and Chauvin continues to kneel on Floyd’s neck for nearly three minutes despite appeals by bystanders to get off of him, according to court documents.The four officers involved, including Chauvin, were fired on Tuesday. Chauvin was arrested and charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter on Friday, more than three days after the incident.",
    "Minneapolis policy requires police officers to stop fellow police from using unreasonable force, not just follow orders.Minneapolis is among several cities with policies on the books requiring police officers to intervene to stop colleagues from using unreasonable force, but that did not save George Floyd.Law enforcement experts say such rules will always run up against entrenched police culture and the fear of being ostracised and branded a “rat” for speaking up against violations.Power dynamics may have been magnified in the Floyd case because two of the four officers involved were rookies and the most senior officer on the scene was a training officer, Derek Chauvin, a 19-year police veteran who was seen kneeling on the back of the Black man’s neck despite his cries that he could not breathe.Even though lawyers for the rookie officers say both men voiced their concerns about Chauvin’s actions at the time, they ultimately failed to stop him. Chauvin is now charged with second-degree murder, and his three fellow officers are charged with aiding and abetting.“This is a lesson for every cop in America: if you see something that is wrong, you need to step in,” said Joseph Giacalone, a former New York police sergeant who now teaches at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice. “There are a lot of grey areas in policing, but this was crystal clear. You’re better off being ostracised by the group than going to prison for murder.”Andrew Scott, a former Boca Raton, Florida, police chief who testifies in use-of-force cases, said: “They’re suffering the effects of an organisational culture that doesn’t allow that or reward that behaviour. The fraternity of law enforcement is a tight fraternity and fraternities have a group-think.”Lawyers for the now-fired two rookies, Thomas Lane and J Alexander Kueng, emphasised their place in police hierarchy in their initial court appearance this past week. They noted that they were only on their fourth day as full-fledged policemen at the time of Floyd’s May 25 arrest, while Chauvin was an authority figure as a designated training officer for new policemen.“They’re required to call him ‘Sir’,” Lane’s lawyer, Earl Gray, told the judge. “He has 20 years’ experience. What is my client supposed to do but to follow what the training officer said? Is that aiding and abetting a crime?”Gray noted that Lane questioned Chauvin’s actions during the arrest, and Kueng’s lawyer Thomas Plunkett said his client told fellow officers, “You shouldn’t be doing this.”But according to the criminal complaints that detailed Floyd’s arrest on suspicion of passing a counterfeit bill, the officers did not back up their words with action.Lane held Floyd’s legs and Kueng held his back while Chauvin placed his knee on Floyd’s head and neck. That is when Floyd repeatedly said “I can’t breathe”, “Mama” and “please”. At one point, Floyd said, “I’m about to die.” Nevertheless, Chauvin, Lane and Kueng did not move. And a fourth officer, Tou Thao, continued standing nearby keeping onlookers back.Moments later, Lane asked, “Should we roll him on his side?” Chauvin replied: “No, staying put where we got him.”Lane said he was worried Floyd would experience excited delirium, a condition in which a person can become agitated and aggressive or suddenly die, according to the documents.“That’s why we have him on his stomach,” Chauvin replied.Despite his concerns, Lane did not do anything to help Floyd or to reduce the force being used on him, the complaint said. Neither he nor Keung and Chauvin moved from their positions until an ambulance came and took Floyd to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead.Minneapolis police added a “duty to intervene” policy in 2016, saying officers are required to “either stop or attempt to stop another sworn employee when force is being inappropriately applied or is no longer required”.City officials moved on Friday to strengthen that duty by seeking to make it enforceable in court and to require officers to immediately report to their superiors when they see the use of any neck restraint or chokehold.Similar “duty to intervene” policies and initiatives had been in place for years in New York City, Miami and New Orleans. Since the Floyd case, Dallas and Charlotte, North Carolina, are among the places that have enacted similar policies. But, Scott said, “There’s policy, and then there’s practice. More likely than not, practice and custom will prevail over policy.”Departments often do not reward officers for interfering with their colleagues or reporting that they broke policy, Scott said. And officers who do intervene risk being ostracised by their fellow officers and branded as informers.“In law enforcement, if you’re considered an individual who can’t be trusted, you’re not going to have the timely back-up from other officers,” Scott said. “That’s a legitimate fear factor.”Geoff Alpert, a criminology professor at the University of South Carolina, said when Lane questioned Chauvin at the time, he was undoubtedly “scared to death”.But ultimately, Alpert said, “he wasn’t courageous enough” to physically intervene to stop him.“He knew he would get hell from the 19-year veteran and all his buddies.”Lost in the furore over Floyd’s case and the national protests and debate over issues of racism and police brutality is the fact that two of the four officers involved in the arrest were minorities, hired as part of a Minneapolis police programme credited with helping to diversify the largely white force.Thao, a 34-year-old of Southeast Asian Hmong descent had been on the force for more than 10 years, and Kueng, a 26-year-old African American rookie who previously worked as a department store security guard, were both parts of the community service officer programme that brings in recruits to work part-time with the goal of making them regular members of the force.Chauvin, 44, is white, as is Lane, though he is an outlier of a different sort, a 37-year-old rookie who joined the police after working as a juvenile detention guard.Chuck Wexler, executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum, a Washington-based think-tank, said getting officers to take action, sometimes against more experienced colleagues, is at the heart of stopping abuses by police.“These new officers are put in a position where they’re told, ‘This is your mentor. He will teach you,'” he said. “A 20-year veteran is supposed to know what he is doing, and clearly he didn’t. He made every mistake possible.”",
    "Defence strikes first juror from pool after she said the actions of the former  Minneapolis police officer on trial were ‘not fair’.Jury selection in the trial of a former Minneapolis police officer charged in George Floyd’s death has begun with the first potential juror excused after she revealed during questioning that she thought the way the officer acted was “not fair”.The woman, a mother of three from Mexico, said she saw a bystander video showing Derek Chauvin kneeling on Floyd’s neck, but she did not understand why the officer did not get up when Floyd said he could not breathe.“That’s not fair because we are humans, you know?” she said.Defence lawyer Eric Nelson noted the woman said on her questionnaire she wanted to be on the jury “to give my opinion of the unjust death of George Floyd”.In this screengrab, defence lawyer Eric Nelson questions a potential juror as Hennepin County Judge Peter Cahill presides over jury selection in the trial of Derek Chauvin on Tuesday, March 9, 2021 [Court TV/Pool via AP Photo]Potential jurors must show they can set aside their opinions on the case and view the evidence fairly. The woman said she would be willing to change her mind if she saw evidence from a different perspective, but Nelson used one of his 15 peremptory challenges to dismiss her without providing a reason.Judge Peter Cahill earlier rejected Nelson’s request to remove her for cause over concerns about her English proficiency.The questioning illustrates the challenges facing attorneys in seating a jury after a video of Floyd’s arrest has been widely seen around the world.Cahill set aside three weeks for a process that could go even longer; opening statements are scheduled no sooner than March 29.Chauvin is charged with second-degree murder and manslaughter in Floyd’s death, and jury selection is proceeding despite uncertainty over whether a third-degree murder charge will be added. The state has asked the Minnesota Court of Appeals to stop proceedings until that is resolved, which could mean a delay of weeks or months.Floyd was declared dead on May 25 after Chauvin, who is white, pressed his knee against the Black man’s neck for about nine minutes, holding his position even after Floyd went limp. Floyd’s death sparked sometimes violent protests in Minneapolis and beyond, leading to a nationwide reckoning on race.Chauvin and three other officers were fired; the others face an August trial on aiding and abetting charges.Cahill ruled on several pretrial motions Tuesday, setting parameters for trial testimony. Among them, Cahill said jurors will hear when Chauvin stopped working for the police department, but they will not be told that he was fired or that the city made a “substantial offer” to settle a lawsuit from Floyd’s family. Those details will not be allowed because they could imply guilt, Cahill said.The city had no immediate comment when asked about the settlement offer. A message left with a lawyer for the Floyd family was not immediately returned.Cahill also ruled that a firefighter who can be heard in the bystander video, urging the officers to check Floyd’s pulse, will be allowed to testify about what she saw and whether she thought medical intervention was needed.But she will not be allowed to speculate that she could have saved Floyd if she had intervened. Testimony about what training Chauvin received will be allowed.Former Minnesota police officer Derek Chauvin posing for a booking photograph at Hennepin County Jail in Minneapolis, Minnesota [Hennepin County Sheriff’s Office/Handout via Reuters]Floyd’s death ushered in a wave of summer protests against police brutality and racism over the summer.Hundreds of people gathered outside the court as proceedings began Monday, many carrying signs that read, “Justice for George Floyd” and “Convict Killer Cops”. On Tuesday, there was little evident protest activity.The unintentional second-degree murder charge requires prosecutors to prove that Chauvin’s conduct was a “substantial causal factor” in Floyd’s death and that Chauvin was committing felony assault at the time. The third-degree murder charge would require them to prove that Chauvin caused Floyd’s death through a dangerous act without regard for human life.Manslaughter requires proof that Chauvin caused Floyd’s death through negligence that created an unreasonable risk, and consciously took the chance of causing severe injury or death.",
    "Clip includes scenes of protest marches and instances of violence in the aftermath of unarmed Black man’s death.Twitter has disabled US President Donald Trump’s campaign tribute video to George Floyd on its platform citing a copyright complaint.The clip, which is a collation of photos and video of protest marches and instances of violence in the aftermath of Floyd’s death, has Trump speaking in the background.According to US media outlet Politico, tweets by Trump campaign accounts @TeamTrump and @TrumpWarRoom 2020 included videos where the US president discusses Floyd’s death in Minneapolis, which he called a “grave tragedy”.Floyd’s death last week after a fatal encounter with a police officer has led to nationwide protests. In widely circulated video footage, a white officer was seen kneeling on Floyd’s neck as Floyd gasped for air and repeatedly groaned, “I can’t breathe” before passing out.Twitter said on Thursday the video on the president’s campaign account was affected by its copyright policy.“We respond to valid copyright complaints sent to us by a copyright owner or their authorised representatives,” a Twitter representative said.The three-minute, 45-second video uploaded on Trump’s YouTube channel was tweeted by his campaign on June 3.The clip, which is still on YouTube, garnered more than 60,000 views and 13,000 likes. The video-streaming platform’s parent Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The social media platform has been under fierce scrutiny from the Trump administration since it fact checked Trump’s tweets about unsubstantiated claims of mail-in voting fraud. It also labelled a Trump tweet about protests in Minneapolis as “glorifying violence”.Trump previously said fact checks were “editorial decisions” by Twitter and amounted to political activism. He said it should cost those companies their protection from lawsuits for what is posted on their platforms.The president and his allies, who rely heavily on Twitter to attack their foes, have long accused the tech giant of targeting conservatives on social media by fact checking them or removing their posts.Trump has pledged to introduce legislation that may scrap or weaken a law that shields social media companies from liability for content posted by their users.Companies such as Twitter and Facebook are granted liability protection under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act because they are treated as “platforms”, rather than “publishers”, which can face lawsuits over content.",
    "The French satirical magazine’s new cover shows Queen Elizabeth pressing her knee against Meghan Markle’s neck.The French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo has come under fire after publishing a controversial cover, which several social media users have slammed as racist and distasteful.The cover shows the United Kingdom’s Queen Elizabeth pressing her knee against Meghan Markle’s neck, with the caption reading: “Why Meghan left Buckingham.”Markle, the Duchess of Sussex and the wife of Prince Harry is seen lying on the ground saying: “Because I couldn’t breathe any more.”The cartoon mimics the scene when George Floyd, a Black American, was killed by a Minneapolis police officer last May. Videos shared online at the time showed officer Derek Chauvin, who is white, kneeling on Floyd’s neck for nearly nine minutes as Floyd pleaded for his life, telling him he could not breathe and then stopped moving.Floyd’s killing sparked a wave of Black Lives Matter protests across the United States against police brutality and racial injustice, with demonstrators taking to the streets in cities around the world in solidarity. Minneapolis this week agreed to pay $27m to Floyd’s family to settle a lawsuit over this death.Markle is biracial; her mother is Black and her father is white. After marrying in 2018, Markle and Prince Harry have stepped down from their royal duties are now living in California.In an interview broadcast last week, Markle told Oprah Winfrey why she and Prince Harry stepped down from their royal duties. She accused an unnamed member of the royal family of making racist remarks, saying concerns were relayed to her husband about how dark her son Archie’s skin would be before his birth.Buckingham Palace said in a statement this week the issues raised in the interview were “concerning” and that the royal family would deal with them privately.Discussion of the cover was widespread on Twitter on Saturday, with several users saying it was offensive.Dr Halima Begum, CEO of the Runnymede Trust, a UK-based racial equality think-tank, said the cover was “wrong on every level”.#CharlieHebdo, this is wrong on every level. The Queen as #GeorgeFloyd's murderer crushing Meghan's neck? #Meghan saying she's unable to breathe? This doesnt push boundaries, make anyone laugh or challenge #racism. It demeans the issues & causes offence, across the board. pic.twitter.com/ptNXs8RtuS— Dr Halima Begum (@Halima_Begum) March 13, 2021Is this the free speech that Charlie Hebdo is so passionate about? Racism, disrespect and offence passed off as satire? I’m sorry but no Je suis for me. This is nothing but racist bigotry and inciting hate. Do better with your platform and grow up. pic.twitter.com/Id6hL53p2G— Yasmeen (@yasminnoir) March 13, 2021Aurelien Mondon, a senior lecturer in politics at the University of Bath, said the magazine “is a racist rag and has been for a very long time”.Charlie Hebdo is a racist rag and has been for a very long timeSaying it does not mean condoning the 2015 attacks or being against free speech. It simply means being against racismIgnoring it is being complicit and plays right in the hands of all those who seek to divide us— Aurelien Mondon (@aurelmondon) March 13, 2021Without wading too much into this Charlie Hebdo debate again, if you have to continually explain that your \"satire\" isn't racist & isn't punching down, then it isn't very good satire, it doesn't matter which tradition it comes from, French or otherwise.— Oz Katerji (@OzKaterji) March 13, 2021",
    "Witnesses describe chaotic scene as protesters ran and jumped over barricades to avoid being hit by truck.Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA – A semi-truck drove through a crowd of thousands of protesters who were marching down a highway in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on Sunday, witnesses told Al Jazeera. Live video of the incident showed demonstrators rallying against the death of George Floyd – an unarmed Black man who died on Monday after a white police officer knelt on his neck – running as the truck appeared to charge them. The truck then came to a stop, and protesters begin to gather around it. Police said no serious injuries among the protesters had been reported.“[We] jumped over the barricade and into the grass” as the truck approached, said Sydney Rubel, who witnessed the incident. Rubel told Al Jazeera that she did not see the truck coming, but was alerted by other protesters to move out of the way.BREAKING- Truck moves at full speed into a crowd of thousands of demonstrators #GeorgeFloyd #Minnesota @KSTP pic.twitter.com/pUscK8JgFB— Brett Hoffland (@BrettHoffland) May 31, 2020Natalie Jokinen, another witness, told Jazeera that she and dozens of others, among them children, had been protesting peacefully when the incident took place.“We were all sitting down, we could hear the truck getting faster and faster,” Jokinen said, adding that she was “just terrified”, by the events.In a series of tweets, John Reinan, a reporter for the Minneapolis Star spoke to witnesses who said the driver drove the demonstrators at about 30 mph (48 kph).“A truck came. The horns were blaring. It was picking up speed. It was ploughing down the highway into the protesters. It was the most terrifying thing I’ve ever seen,” Reinan tweeted, quoting a witness named Melanie Ramos.Very disturbing actions by a truck driver on I-35W, inciting a crowd of peaceful demonstrators.

An investigation has been launched. Minnesota Commissioner of Corrections Paul Schnell called the incident “significant and great concern”. The scene from the overpass where a semitrailer ran into a group of protesters.

The company said in a statement that it had been “informed of an incident involving one of our independent contractors in Minneapolis”. It added it would cooperate with authorities. Other witnesses told Al Jazeera that protesters were throwing bikes in front of the truck “to try to get it to stop”. Sunday’s incident took place on the sixth day of protests in Minneapolis over police brutality and Floyd’s death. Protesters are demanding all four Minneapolis officers involved in Floyd’s death be charged. So far, only Derek Chauvin – the white officer who knelt on Floyd’s neck for nearly nine minutes while Floyd pleaded “I can’t breathe” – has been arrested. On Friday, he was charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter. ",
    "AP tally finds 9,300 arrests have been made across the US in connection with recent protests against police brutality.More than 9,300 people have been arrested in United States protests since the May 25 killing of George Floyd, an unarmed Black man, according to an Associated Press news agency tally published on Wednesday.According to the tally, Los Angeles has recorded 2,700 arrests since the protests, followed by New York City with some 1,500 arrests. Police in Dallas and Houston, Texas, and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, have also arrested several hundred people. The toll is likely much higher. The arrests come amid a crackdown on protests against the killing of Floyd and broader acts of police brutality.Many have been arrested for curfew violations, which major cities have imposed to quell demonstrations that have at times turned violent, with looting, vandalism and fires.Some police departments in major cities, such as Houston, say while hundreds have been arrested, “this is an extremely low number … considering the thousands of people in our community demonstrated peacefully”.The tally comes as protests continue to erupt nationwide over the killing of Floyd, who died after a white officer knelt on the 46-year-old’s neck for nearly nine minutes. Video of the incident shows Floyd repeatedly pleading with the officer, saying: “I can’t breathe.” Floyd eventually appears motionless, with the officer’s knee still on his neck.That officer – Derek Chauvin – has been charged with second-degree murder and manslaughter. The other three officers involved have been charged with aiding and abetting a second-degree murder and manslaughter. The protests over police violence have at times been met with just that – more police violence, rights groups say.According to videos, witness accounts, and reports, police have used tear gas, rubber-coated bullets, flashbangs, batons and other tactics against protesters. Police say they are responding to protesters who are violent, pointing to the looting, vandalism and fires that have taken place.In Atlanta, Georgia, six officers were charged after police pulled two people from their car, threw them to the ground and shot them stun guns, according to authorities. Police have also targeted journalists with arrests, intimidation and violence, according to rights groups. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) in Minnesota on Tuesday filed a lawsuit against the state of Minnesota’s state and local law enforcement officials, “to ensure that police officers who target journalists are held fully accountable for their unlawful actions”. The Committee to Protect Journalism has received reports of at least 125 press freedom violations from journalists covering the protests, including reports of a number of arrests.",
    "People in Lebanon and Jerusalem also show support for US protesters demanding justice after George Floyd’s death.Thousands of people protested in London and Berlin on Sunday in solidarity with protesters in the United States demonstrating against the death of a Black man, shown gasping for breath in a video clip, as a white policeman knelt on his neck in Minneapolis.Chanting “no justice, no peace”, and waving placards with the words “How many more?” at Trafalgar Square, the protesters ignored UK government rules banning crowds because of the coronavirus pandemic. Police did not stop them.Demonstrators then marched to the US embassy, where a long line of officers surrounded the building. Several hundred sat in the street and waved placards.Several hundred protesters also staged a rally outside the US embassy in Berlin, holding up posters saying “Justice for George Floyd”, “Stop killing us” and “Who’s next”.Al Jazeera’s correspondent in London Nadim Baba said protests in support of US demonstrators also took place in Manchester in the northwest of England.“One of the chants that was popular was ‘no justice, no peace’, which is not a new chant in Britain,” said Baba, comparing the demonstrations to the 2011 London riots which were sparked by the death of a Black man named Mark Duggan during a police operation.“That alerted people to the issue of discontent within the Black population and also [served as] a reminder about the consistent death of Black men in police custody over the past few decades,” he added.Floyd’s death after his arrest in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on Monday has triggered a tide of protests in the US.Demonstrations against racism and police brutality spread to many cities across the US as people in many parts of the country defied curfews to protest against the killing of Floyd.The days-long protests sweeping the nation have reawakened outrage over years of deaths of Black people at the hands of police, renewing long-standing accusations of institutionalised and systemic racism.Some rallies have turned violent as demonstrators blocked traffic, set fires and clashed with riot police, some of whom fired tear gas and plastic bullets in an effort to restore order. There also have been expressions of solidarity with the demonstrators in parts of the Middle East region.Over the weekend, Lebanese anti-government protesters flooded social media with tweets sympathetic to US protesters, using the hashtag #Americarevolts.It is a play on the slogan for Lebanon’s protest movement, Lebanon revolts, which erupted on October 17 last year.Within 24 hours, the hashtag #Americanrevolts became the number one trending tag in Lebanon.In another expression of solidarity with US protesters, about 150 people marched through central Jerusalem on Saturday to protest against the shooting to death by Israeli police of an unarmed, autistic Palestinian man earlier in the day.The slain man, 32-year-old Iyad el-Hallak, attended and worked at a school for people with special needs in the Old City, close to the spot where he was shot on Saturday morning, according to Palestinian news agency Wafa.Israeli police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said the officers “spotted a suspect with a suspicious object that looked like a pistol. Rosenfeld added that no gun was found in the area. Israel’s Defence Minister Benny Gantz on Sunday issued an apology over the killing. The police also raided el-Hallak’s home in the neighbourhood of Wadi Joz, where members of his family were questioned. Israeli daily newspaper Haaretz said el-Hallak’s family members denied claims that he was carrying a gun, and quoted them as saying “he wasn’t capable of harming anyone”.",
    "Outraged protesters from Sydney to London continue rallies against racism and police brutality.Taking a knee, banging drums and ignoring social distancing measures, outraged protesters from Sydney to London kicked off global rallies against racism and police brutality on Saturday.The death at police hands of George Floyd, an unarmed Black man in the US state of Minnesota, has brought tens of thousands out onto the streets during a pandemic that is ebbing in Asia and Europe but still spreading in other parts of the world.“It is time to burn down institutional racism,” one speaker shouted through a megaphone outside the Parliament building in London.“Silence is violence,” the throng shouted back in the rain.Officials around the world have been trying to balance understanding at people’s pent-up anger with warnings about the dangers of a disease that has officially claimed nearly 400,000 lives globally.Yet tens of thousands of Australians defied Prime Minister Scott Morrison’s call to “find a better way”, and thousands more in the United Kingdom ignored the health minister’s warning that the “coronavirus remains a real threat”.“We want justice. We want to breathe,” hundreds chanted in Tunis, as demonstrations convulsing US cities spilled out across the world.“Are you sure of your silence,” asked a poster of a man laying a pink rose at a memorial set up outside the president’s office in Pretoria, South Africa. In Paris, riot police held back a crowd of several thousand who gathered outside the US embassy compound for an unsanctioned protest.“I find it scandalous that all these injustices go unpunished,” Dior, a 21-year-old Senegalese-Ivorian student, said amidst crowds holding up placards reading “Being black is not a crime” and “Our police are assassins”.“How many more?” asked a poster held up in a crowd of thousands in Frankfurt.In North Carolina, a long line of cars snaked its way down a highway as mourners arrived for a viewing and memorial service at a church not far from Floyd’s hometown.  And tens of thousands were again expected in Washington, DC where Mayor Muriel Bowse renamed the area outside the White House “Black Lives Matter Plaza”.",
    "Hundreds more taken into custody everyday as protests continue despite heavy police presence.More than 10,000 people have been arrested in protests that have rocked the United States since the police killing of George Floyd, an unarmed Black man, according to an Associated Press tally. All four Minneapolis police officers involved in Floyd’s death have been charged. Derek Chauvin, who knelt on Floyd’s neck, has been charged with second-degree murder, which was upgraded from a previous charge of third-degree murder. He also faces a second-degree manslaughter charge. The other three are charged with aiding and abetting second-degree murder and manslaughter.US President Donald Trump was rebuked by his former defence secretary, James Mattis, who said he was trying to sow divisions. Trump’s current defence chief, Mark Esper, also said he opposed Trump’s threat to send in the military to quell unrest.Several major cities scaled back or lifted curfews imposed for the past few days. As protests continue, police in riot gear charged into a crowd of about 1,000 protesters defying a local curfew in New York City’s Brooklyn borough, albeit peacefully, near an outdoor plaza, and clubbed demonstrators and journalists as they scurried for cover in heavy rain.Latest updates:This blog has closed for the day. To see more live updates from Thursday, including Floyd’s Minneapolis memorial service, follow along here. Governor Tim Walz is sending Minnesota National Guard troops to state’s western border because of what he says are credible threats of violence during demonstrations planned in neighbouring North Dakota.The city of Moorhead, Minnesota, lies just across the border from Fargo, North Dakota.Walz’s order didn’t say how many guard members are being deployed in Clay County. The governor didn’t provide details on what he perceives is a credible threat.President Donald Trump has blamed violence and looting on a loose grouping of far-left activists known as Antifa. Authorities have found little evidence to support these claims. There are concerns about white nationalist groups planning violence, with some suspected white nationalists allegedly shooting at protesters in North Carolina. “The Minnesota National Guard stands ready to provide protection for all Minnesotans,” Walz said in a statement. A memorial service was to be held on Thursday for George Floyd led by civil rights activist Al Sharpton.The ceremony will be held in Minneapolis, where Floyd died after being detained by police.Sharpton, who will give the eulogy for Floyd, met with his family on Wednesday.“Tomorrow we will lay out how we will mobilize nationally in the name of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, and more,” the leading rights activist said on Twitter, referring to a black jogger who was shot dead in February and a black medical worker killed by police in her own apartment in March.Japanese tech giant SoftBank Group said it was setting up a $100-million fund for black entrepreneurs.The Opportunity Growth Fund “will only invest in companies led by founders and entrepreneurs of colour,” said the firm’s executive vice-president Marcelo Claure in an internal letter obtained by AFP news agency.Venture capital start-ups are “overwhelmingly white, male and Ivy-league educated and based in Silicon Valley. Just one percent of VC-backed founders are black,” he added.Many major US corporations have issued statements decrying discrimination and some, including Apple and Bank of America, have put some money behind the effort by supporting civil rights advocacy groups or programmes targeting disadvantaged populations.The US Park Police said it has placed two officers on administrative leave after video showed two Australian journalists being attacked during Monday night’s protest in Washington, DC.Acting Chief Gregory T. Monahan said the attack is being investigated.Video captured by WJLA-TV in Washington showed reporter Amanda Brace and cameraman Tim Myers being assaulted as law enforcement officials cleared an area near the White House so Trump could walk to a nearby church that had been damaged during the demonstrations the previous night.The journalists were reporting live for Australia’s Channel 7 on the demonstrations protesting George Floyd’s death at police hands in Minnesota.“As is consistent with our established practices and procedures, two US Park Police officers have been assigned to administrative duties, while an investigation takes place regarding the incident with the Australian Press,” Monahan said in a statement posted on Twitter.Australia’s ambassador to the United States has complained about the attack that the network’s news director Craig McPherson described as “nothing short of wanton thuggery”.Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his allies have seen donations swell in recent days, several top fundraisers said.Trump’s response to the demonstrations over George Floyd’s death pushed new donors and even some Republicans to open their checkbooks, the fundraisers said.“I’ve seen several significant donors who had never been involved in politics before but believe that something has to be done,” said Michael Kempner, a New York-based fundraiser for Biden.He called the influx “a sea change in the level of urgency and the size of the commitments,” but declined to compare recent totals with previous figures because of Biden’s relatively new arrangement with the Democratic National Committee that allows for much higher contributions.Biden, the former vice president who will face the Republican Trump in the November 3 election, told supporters in an email on Monday that his campaign hit an ambitious $6mn online fundraising goal over six days at the end of May.Trump has denounced those who carried out looting during protests as “thugs,” and his campaign has reiterated his calls for “law and order” in fundraising appeals this week.More than 10,000 people have been arrested in protests across the US, according to an Associated Press tally of known arrests.In a nearly 24-hour period from Saturday night to Sunday afternoon, 41 of the 52 people cited with protest-related arrests had Minnesota driver’s licenses, according to the Hennepin County sheriff.In the nation’s capital, 86 percent of the more than 400 people arrested as of Wednesday afternoon were from Washington, DC, Maryland and Virginia.In Los Angeles, an online fundraising campaign has gathered $2 million so far to help more than 3,000 people arrested in demonstrations since Floyd died on May 25 in Minneapolis.Los Angeles Chief Michel Moore told the city’s Police Commission the bulk of the arrests, about 2,500, were for failure to disperse or curfew violations.The rest were for crimes including burglary, looting, assaults on police officers and other violence, Moore told the panel, which functions as the police department’s civilian oversight board.The only other US city with an arrest toll that comes close to Los Angeles’ is New York, with about 2,000, according to AP’s tally.The AP tally didn’t take into account any additional arrests still unreported from Wednesday evening.The deputy mayor of a Maine city has resigned and was charged with filing a false report after he said someone hacked his social media account to make racist statements about the George Floyd killing.Brewer police said Thomas Morelli was charged in relation to the incident, the Bangor Daily News reported on Wednesday.Morelli issued a statement in which he said he is “ashamed of my comments and behavior” and acknowledged his participation in “Facebook trolling.”Morelli had told police on Monday that someone had gained access to his Facebook account to post racist comments about Floyd.An investigation determined that Morelli made the comments, police said.Britain expects the United States to continue its tradition of protecting media freedoms, foreign minister Dominic Raab said when asked about protests sparked by the death of George Floyd.While the demonstrations have been largely peaceful, police in some cities have used force against journalists and protesters, and protesters have clashed with police.“I want to see America come together … you mention media freedoms and journalistic freedoms, of course the US has a fine tradition of protecting all of those things and yes we do expect that to continue,” he Raab said in an interview on Sky News.Meghan, Britain’s Duchess of Sussex and wife of Queen Elizabeth’s grandson Prince Harry, has spoken about events following the death of George Floyd saying she was sorry that children had to grow up in a world where racism still existed and that current events in the United States were “devastating”.“I know you know that black lives matter,” Meghan said in a video she recorded for students graduating from her old high school in Los Angeles which was aired on Wednesday.“For the past couple of weeks I’ve been planning on saying a few words to you for your graduation and as we’ve all seen over the last week what is happening in our country, and in our state and in our home town of LA is absolutely devastating,” said Meghan, whose mother is African American and father is white.A confrontation in Brooklyn left one police officer stabbed in the neck, two officers with gunshot wounds to their hands and another man shot by police, the New York Police Department said.The officers were taken to a hospital with wounds that were not expected to be life-threatening, the department said. The condition of the man shot by police was not immediately released.The bloodshed happened just before midnight in the hours after an 8 pm (local time) curfew that was intended to quell unrest over the death of George Floyd in Minnesota.Details on how it unfolded weren’t immediately available.A neighborhood resident, though, said there was no protest in the area at the time of the shooting, and it wasn’t clear if there was any connection to the unrest.The US president has responded to former Defense Secretary James Mattis’s scathing criticism of his handling of the racial justice protests sweeping the country.In a series of tweets, Trump called Mattis the “world’s most overrated General” and said: “Glad he’s gone!”…His primary strength was not military, but rather personal public relations. I gave him a new life, things to do, and battles to win, but he seldom “brought home the bacon”. I didn’t like his “leadership” style or much else about him, and many others agree. Glad he is gone!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 4, 2020The president’s press secretary, Kayleigh McEnany, called Mattis’s article in The Atlantic “little more than a self-promotional stunt to appease the DC elite”.Under Trump, she wrote on Twitter, “America will unite in LAW AND ORDER!”London Breed, the mayor of San Francisco, said she will be lifting a curfew in the city at 5am local time on Thursday.“The protests we have seen in this city and across the country are for a peaceful cause and our city will continue to facilitate any and all peaceful demonstrations,” she wrote in a tweet.Starting tomorrow morning at 5am we will be lifting the curfew in San Francisco. The protests we have seen in this city and across the country are for an important cause and our city will continue to facilitate any and all peaceful demonstrations.— London Breed (@LondonBreed) June 3, 2020In Los Angeles, Mayor Eric Garcetti said barring a setback, the city’s curfew will be discontinued on Thursday. Los Angeles is currently locked down, with its fifth curfew set to last from 9pm on Wednesday to 5am on Thursday.Jenny Durkan, mayor of Seattle, cancelled a curfew in the west coast city, saying the chief of the police believes we “can balance public safety and ensure peaceful protests can continue without a curfew”.“For those peacefully demonstrating tonight, please know you can continue to demonstrate,” she said in a tweet just hours before the curfew was to kick in. “We want you to continue making your voice heard.”For those peacefully demonstrating tonight, please know you can continue to demonstrate. We want you to continue making your voice heard.— Mayor Jenny Durkan (@MayorJenny) June 4, 2020The police department in Charlotte, North Carolina, is coming under criticism after a video posted to social media appeared to show officers using chemical agents on demonstrators who were boxed in while protesting the death of George Floyd.The video was recorded Tuesday night by Justin LaFrancois, co-founder and publisher of the alternative Charlotte newspaper Queen City Nerve. He said officers fired tear gas and flashbangs from behind the protesters, and in front of them, as well. He also said officers perched on top of buildings were firing pepper balls down on the crowd.“We were completely trapped,” LaFrancois said. “There was one way to get out, and half of the group did go out that way through the tear gas and through the pepper balls. But for the rest of us, the only route of escape … was to pull up a gate on the parking structure that we were pressed up against.”LaFrancois said people tried to squeeze under the 6-inch opening in the gate. But as they looked for an exit from the parking deck, he said officers began firing pepper balls after they entered the deck from the other side.Charlotte-Mecklenburg police said on Twitter that they are looking into the incident.A man suspected of robbing a pharmacy in the San Francisco Bay area was fatally shot by officers who thought a hammer he was carrying in his waistband was a firearm, police said.Sean Monterrosa, 22, of San Francisco is the first confirmed death at the hands of law enforcement related to smash-and-grabs and protests in California since Floyd’s death. Vallejo Police Chief Shawny Williams said officers were responding to calls of looting at a Walgreens early Tuesday when the shooting occurred.Officers said Monterrosa began running toward a car when he suddenly stopped, got on his knees and placed his hands above his waist, revealing what appeared to be the butt of a firearm in his waistband. An officer shot five times through a car window, striking him once.“The intent was to stop the looting and arrest any perpetrators if necessary. The officers reacted to a perceived threat,” Williams said.John Burris, a lawyer for the family, said he is appalled police would shoot at a person who was on his knees with his hands raised.A full autopsy of Floyd showed that he had previously tested positive for COVID-19.The report by Chief Medical Examiner Andrew Baker spelled out clinical details, including that Floyd had tested positive for COVID-19 on April 3 but appeared asymptomatic. The report also noted Floyd’s lungs appeared healthy, but he had some narrowing of arteries in the heart.The county’s earlier summary report had listed fentanyl intoxication and recent methamphetamine use under “other significant conditions” but not under “cause of death”. The full report’s footnotes noted that signs of fentanyl toxicity could include “severe respiratory depression” and seizures.Former Defense Secretary James Mattis denounced Trump’s heavy-handed use of military force to crack down on protests and said Trump was setting up a “false conflict” between the military and civilian society.“I have watched this week’s unfolding events, angry and appalled,” Mattis wrote.Mattis retired as defence secretary in December 2018 to protest Trump’s Syria policy. He declined to speak out against Trump, saying he owed the nation public silence while his former boss remained in office.“Donald Trump is the first president in my lifetime who does not try to unite the American people – does not even pretend to try. Instead he tries to divide us,” Mattis wrote in a statement published by The Atlantic. Mattis said the protesters are rightly demanding that the country follow the words of “Equal Justice Under Law” that are on display at the US Supreme Court.He took particular issue with the use of force to move back protesters so Trump could visit St John’s Church the day after it was damaged by fire during protests.“We know that we are better than the abuse of executive authority that we witnessed in Lafayette Square,” Mattis said.Read more here.Three Nevada men who allegedly have ties to a movement of “right-wing extremists” advocating the overthrow of the US government have been arrested on terrorism-related charges in what authorities say was a conspiracy to trigger violence during recent protests in Las Vegas.Federal prosecutors say the three men, who are white and served in the US military, are accused of conspiring to carry out a plan that began in April in conjunction with protests against coronavirus lockdowns and later sought to capitalise on protests against Floyd’s death in police custody.Stephen T Parshall, 35, Andrew T Lynam Jr, 23, and William L Loomis, 40, were being held on $1m bond each in the Clark County jail, according to court records.Each currently faces two federal charges – conspiracy to damage and destroy by fire and explosive, and possession of unregistered firearms. In state court, they have been accused of felony conspiracy, terrorism and explosives possession.The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has accused Minnesota law enforcement of wrongly arresting, injuring and harassing journalists covering protests.In the lawsuit, the ACLU accuses the Minneapolis Police Department and Minnesota State Patrol of shooting journalists in the face with rubber bullets, arresting reporters and photographers without cause, and threatening them at gunpoint.The suit alleges a Minnesota State Patrol officer forced videographer Tom Aviles to the ground and arrested him even though he had identified himself as a member of the press and was carrying a large video camera. Also arrested was CNN reporter Omar Jimenez, during a live broadcast. Los Angeles Times reporter Molly Hennessy-Fiske and photographer Carolyn Cole were backed against a wall, subjected to tear gas and had projectiles hurled at them.Retired Navy Admiral Mike Mullen, the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said he was “sickened” to see how law enforcement – including the National Guard – had cleared the area outside of the White House on Monday and warned against over-use of the US military.“Our fellow citizens are not the enemy, and must never become so,” Mullen wrote.Trump said on Wednesday that he did not believe that he would need to use US troops to counter protests.“It depends, I don’t think we’ll have to,” Trump said when asked in an interview with Newsmax TV whether he would send the military to any cities.LAW & ORDER!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 3, 2020The president had previously said that he could use military forces in states that have failed to crack down on the violent protests.Former US President Barack Obama said the violence and injustices that are the underlying causes that sparked nationwide protests need change at the local level.“I’m urging every mayor in this country to review your use of force policies with members of your community, and commit to report on planned reforms,” he said in a virtual town hall.Obama said both protest and voting are important, as officials who could effect change in 19,000 American municipalities and more than 18,000 local enforcement jurisdictions are elected and could be held accountable by voters.“To bring about real change. We both have to highlight a problem, and make people in power uncomfortable, but we also have to translate that into practical solutions and laws that can be implemented.”He told young men and women of colour “your lives matter and your dreams matter” and commended those in law enforcement who have marched alongside the protestors.In an interview with CNN, Minnesota Attorney General Ellison said that if the prosecution gets evidence to support a first-degree murder charge against former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin in the George Floyd case, it will be presented to a jury.“We are continuing to gather evidence, and if we get evidence to support that, that we can put in front of a jury, we will present that. At this time, we brought forth the maximum ethical charges we could,” he said.New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio says the city has taken a “step forward” in restoring order with the help of an early curfew.There was much less widespread looting of stores Tuesday night amid a large police presence, he said. The citywide curfew continues from 8pm to 5am this week, imposed to prevent the nighttime chaos and destruction that followed peaceful protests for several days in a row.Police said they arrested about 280 people on protest-related charges Tuesday, compared with 700 the previous night.Governor Andrew Cuomo, who was critical of the prior police response, says the city was “much better”, and officers were better equipped to keep the peace.Hundreds of people in the US state of Connecticut held a symbolic funeral procession to honour George Floyd and protest racial injustice.In the city of Danbury, protesters shouted “I can’t breathe,” as they marched through the city and walked onto Interstate 84, briefly shutting down traffic on the highway.The procession in Floyd’s honour ended with a rally at the state Capitol, where speakers eulogised victims of police brutality and called for a sustained effort to address issues of poverty and discrimination.“This is a significant step forward on the road to justice,” Benjamin Crump, attorney for the Floyd family, said in a statement, “we are gratified that this important action was brought before George Floyd’s body was laid to rest,” Crump said.He later told CNN that Chauvin should be facing a first-degree murder charge and that Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison had informed Floyd’s family that the investigation is ongoing and other charges could be filed.All four fired Minneapolis police officers involved in George Floyd’s death now face charges.According to court documents, Tou Thao, Thomas Lane and J Alexander Kueng all face aiding and abetting second-degree unintentional murder charges, as well as aiding and abetting second-degree manslaughter.NEW: Three other Mpls police officers present at the scene of George Floyd's death are charged with Aiding and Abetting Second Degree Murder and Manslaughter.— Patrick Kessler (@PatKessler) June 3, 2020Derek Chauvin’s murder charge, previously third-degree, has been upgraded to second-degree unintentional murder, which can carry a sentence of up to 40 years, 15 years longer than the maximum sentence for third-degree murder.Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison has requested that bail be set at $1m for each of the four former officers, the documents showed. Ellison is expected to hold a briefing later.Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison will elevate charges against former officer Derek Chauvin to second-degree murder, according to US Senator Amy Klobuchar.“This is another important step for justice”, Klobuchar, a former candidate for the Democratic nomination for president and rumoured contender for Joe Biden’s vice president pick, tweeted on Wednesday.Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison is increasing charges against Derek Chauvin to 2nd degree in George Floyd’s murder and also charging other 3 officers. This is another important step for justice.— Amy Klobuchar (@amyklobuchar) June 3, 2020Klobuchar also said the other three officers involved would be charged. The Minneapolis Star-Tribune also published a report with similar information.Ellison is expected to make an announcement on the charges this afternoon.UN rights chief Michelle Bachelet on Wednesday decried “structural racism” in the US and voiced alarm at the “unprecedented assault” on journalists covering protests across the country.Bachelet insisted that the grievances at the heart of the protests that have erupted in hundreds of US cities needed to be heard and addressed if the country was to move forward.“The voices calling for an end to the killings of unarmed African Americans need to be heard,” Bachelet, the former president of Chile, said in a statement.Bachelet stressed the need for clear and constructive leadership to bring the country through the crisis.“Especially during a crisis, a country needs its leaders to condemn racism unequivocally; for them to reflect on what has driven people to boiling point; to listen and learn; and to take actions that truly tackle inequalities,” she said.Active-duty troops brought in to help if needed during the civil unrest in the US capital are beginning to return to their home base, after two days of more peaceful demonstrations in Washington, DC, senior defence officials told The Associated Press on Wednesday.The officials said about 200 soldiers with the 82nd Airborne’s immediate response force would be the first to leave on Wednesday.The remainder of the active-duty troops, who have all been kept at military bases outside the city in northern Virginia and Maryland, will also get pulled home in the coming days if conditions allow, said the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss imminent troop movements.The active-duty troops were available but were not used in response to the protests.Benjamin Crump, the prominent civil rights lawyer representing the Floyd family, called for all officers involved in Floyd’s death to be arrested and charged before Thursday’s memorial in Minneapolis. So far, only Derek Chauvin – who knelt on Floyd’s neck – has been charged. Pointing out that some of Floyd’s last words were, “I can’t breathe”, Crump called on those present to take a “breath for peace”. “Let’s take a breath for justice, let’s take a breath to heal our country. And most importantly take a breath for George Floyd,” he said, joined by members of Floyd’s family. “Let’s take a breath this week to heal this country.“Let’s follow George’s example,” he added, reading the names of several Black people who have been killed by police.”Let’s take a breath for all the marginalised and disenfranchised and dehumanised people … who were killed unjustifiably, who were killed unnecessarily and who was killed senselessly because they are American citizens … and they human beings and finally, they are children of God”.Minnesota Attorney General’s office has completed its review of initial evidence in the investigation of the four police officers involved in the killing of George Floyd and will announce its decision on further charges later this afternoon, CNN reports. Protesters have demanded all four officers involved be charged in Floyd’s death.Only one – white officer Derek Chauvin, who knelt on Floyd’s neck for nearly nine minutes as he pleaded, “I can’t breathe” – has been arrested and charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter.Former officers JA Keung and Thomas Lane, who helped Chauvin restrain Floyd, and Tou Thao, have not yet been charged. Medical examiners have designated the death a homicide, though this is not a legal determination. Part of a June 1 internal intelligence assessment of the protests viewed by Reuters shows that US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) officials said most of the violence appears to have been driven by opportunists.Trump has threatened to designate Antifa, a loose conglomeration of anti-fascist activists, as a “terrorist” organisation for allegedly causing violence in the protests.Reuters cited two unnamed Justice Department officials who said they had seen little to support claims that far-left groups were causing violence.The DHS report said there was some evidence based on open-source and DHS reporting that Antifa may be contributing to the violence, a view shared by some local police departments in public statements and interviews with Reuters. The part of the document seen by Reuters did not provide any specific evidence of extremist-driven violence, but noted that white supremacists were working online to increase tensions between protesters and law enforcement by calling for acts of violence against both groups. There was no evidence, however, that white supremacists were causing violence at any of the protests, the document said.But the Southern Poverty Law Center, an Alabama-based monitoring group, claims it has found evidence that a person arrested at a North Carolina for allegedly shooting at groups of protesters has ties to neo-Confederate groups.Secretary of Defense Mark Esper has said during a news conference that he supports the rights of US citizens to protest peacefully and does not support the invocation of the Insurrection Act.“It is these rights and freedoms that make our country so special. It is these rights and freedoms that American service members are willing to fight and die for,” Esper said in remarks before taking questions.“I do not support invoking the Insurrection Act.”President Trump threatened to use the act to use the military to quell protests across the country. The Insurrection Act dates to the early 1800s and permits the president to send in US forces to suppress a domestic insurrection that has hindered the normal enforcement of US law. Esper further said he was not informed about Trump’s controversial photo-op at a church which took place on Monday. “I was not aware of law enforcement’s plans for the park. I was not briefed on them, nor should I expect to be,” Esper said.The defence secretary also stated he was working hard to keep his department out of politics, though it is challenging as the country moves closer to elections.Workers have removed the statue of controversial former Philadelphia Mayor Frank Rizzo, which was recently defaced during a protest following Floyd’s death.As National Guard troops deployed in the wake of recent protests watched, a crane lifted the 10-foot-tall (3-metre) bronze statue and workers moved it from its stand outside the Municipal Services Building, across from City Hall. It was loaded onto the back of a truck.Iran’s supreme leader has assailed Washington in the wake of Floyd’s killing for its “duplicitous policies” when it comes to upholding human rights.Ayatollah Ali Khamenei claimed that in the US, “they kill people in an open crime, and they do not offer an apology while claiming [to support] human rights.”Khamenei, who has the final say on all state matters, added: “Apparently, the African American man who was killed there was not a human being.”The German government is shocked by the death of Floyd, an unarmed Black American man, at the hands of police and must work to counter racism at home like other countries, a government spokesman said on Wednesday.“The death of George Floyd … shocked people in Germany and all over the world, it shocked the federal government [of Germany] too,” spokesman Steffen Seibert said. “It is an appalling and avoidable death.” British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Wednesday Black lives matter, and he supported the right to protest, in a lawful and socially-distanced way, after the killing by police of Floyd in the US stirred widespread anger.“Of course, Black lives matter and I totally understand the anger, the grief that is felt not just in America but around the world and in our country as well,” he told Parliament.“I also support, as I’ve said, the right to protest. The only point I would make … is that any protest should be carried out lawfully and in this country protests should be carried out in accordance with our rules on social distancing.”____________________________________________________________________Hello and welcome to Al Jazeera’s continuing coverage of the protests in the US over the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, Minnesota. This is Laurin-Whitney Gottbrath in Louisville, Kentucky, and Creede Newton in Washington, DC.Here are a few things to catch up on:See the updates from Monday’s protests here.",
    "Minneapolis protesters say they’re disappointed charges against four officers weren’t stronger, but they remain hopeful.Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA – The intersection where George Floyd was killed on May 25 has during the last week become a space for reflection, mourning and the honouring of the 46-year-old Black man, who died after a white officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes as he called out, “I can’t breathe.”Flowers, signs, cards, candles and a mural fill the pavement turned memorial at 38th Street and Chicago Avenue in Minneapolis, Minnesota.In many ways, the atmosphere at the site on Wednesday felt the same as all the other days. Music filled the air. A few people danced. Small children played. But the heaviness that has been hanging around the intersection for the past week felt a bit thicker on Wednesday than it had felt before.More than 1,000 people stood mostly silent as Floyd’s son, Quincy Mason, visited the site.“No man or woman should be without their father,” Quincy Mason told the crowd.Benjamin Crump, the prominent civil rights lawyer who is representing the family, stood by Quincy Mason’s side, urging the arrests of all four officers involved in Floyd’s death before Thursday, when the city is set to hold a public memorial.“Not one minute, not two minutes, not three minutes,” Crump shouted out, referencing the time Floyd’s neck was pinned to the ground. By the time he reached “almost nine minutes,” the crowd chanted along with him. “Eight minutes and 46 seconds George Floyd begged for air.”“We cannot have two justice systems in America – one of Black America and one for white America,” Crump said.“Change is going to come in the tragic killing of George Floyd,” he added. “That change starts today.”Moments after Crump and Mason left the area, someone in the crowd yelled, “They got all four!”News had surfaced that prosecutors decided to upgrade the charges previously announced against Derek Chauvin, the now-fired officer who knelt on Floyd’s neck. They also announced charges against the three other fired officers involved.Following the news, the heaviness of the day turned noticeably lighter, a collective sigh of relief from the crowd.“I feel very very happy that they decided to charge them,” said Williametta Jallah, who used to live in the neighbourhood.“Justice should prevail,” she said, as cheers rung out.“I got really excited because, honestly, we never do get justice out here,” Tati Ampah said. “For me, as long as they do get jail time, and as long as they do like understand that they did something wrong and that one of them could have jumped in and stopped a man from dying.”Chauvin, who has been in custody since Friday, had his third-degree murder charge increased to second-degree. He is also charged with second-degree manslaughter. The three other officers – Thomas Lane, J Kueng and Tou Thao – were charged with aiding and abetting second-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. As initial news settled in, many at the memorial on Wednesday said the upgrade to the murder charge was not enough.“Am I happy? No” said Tiffany, who flew out to Minneapolis from New York City on Monday. She acknowledged that “progress” was being made, but said Chauvin should have been charged with first-degree murder instead. It was a call made by Floyd’s family, as well.In announcing the new charges on Wednesday, Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison noted that “you have to have to have premeditation and deliberation to charge first-degree murder”.He added that “history shows that there are clear challenges here” in prosecuting police officers.The second-degree murder charge carries a maximum 40-year sentence.“I strongly believe that these developments are in the interest of justice for Mr Floyd, his family, our community and our state,” Ellison said.Others at the memorial site were sceptical that the charges would result in convictions.“Just because they’re charged, don’t mean that they’ll be found guilty, and just because they’re found guilty, [it doesn’t] mean they can’t be found guilty of a lesser crime and given a slap on the wrist, just like other police officers do,” said John Thompson.“You gotta look at it from the eyes of a Black man,” he told Al Jazeera. “It sucks. To come in contact with the same people who are supposed to serve and protect you. They got the serving part down pat. They served the s*** out of [him].”Still, many remained hopeful.“We got a charge; we need a conviction,” the crowd yelled.“I have hope,” Jallah, the Minneapolis resident who used to live in the neighbourhood, said.",
    "Two white men and a woman with a police officer uncle are selected for the 12-member jury panel.The first jurors have been selected in the high-profile trial of the white police officer accused of killing George Floyd, a Black man whose death laid bare racial wounds in the United States and sparked “Black Lives Matter” protests across the globe.Two white men and a woman with a police officer uncle were selected on Tuesday for the 12-member panel that will decide the fate of former Minneapolis Police Department officer Derek Chauvin.He is facing charges of second-degree murder and manslaughter in connection with Floyd’s death in May last year that was captured by bystanders on phone video.Jury selection had been scheduled to begin on Monday but was delayed for a day as prosecutors sought to reinstate a third-degree murder charge against 44-year-old Chauvin.A Minnesota court of appeals has not yet issued its ruling but Hennepin County Judge Peter Cahill decided to go ahead with jury selection.Second-degree murder carries a maximum sentence of 40 years in prison.The jury selection process could take up to three weeks with opening arguments expected to begin on March 29.Chauvin was dismissed from the police force after he was captured on video with his knee on the neck of a pleading, gasping Floyd for nearly nine minutes.Chauvin, who has been free on bail, appeared in court on Tuesday surrounded by plexiglass as a COVID-19 precaution.He frequently jotted down notes on a yellow legal pad and conferred with his lawyers as prospective jurors were being questioned.Lawyers for both sides face the difficult task of finding jurors who have not already made up their minds about the widely publicised case.The identities of the jurors will not be revealed until after the trial.Three other police officers involved in Floyd’s arrest – Alexander Kueng, Thomas Lane and Tou Thao – face lesser charges and will be tried separately.Floyd’s arrest was prompted by accusations that he had tried to pass a counterfeit $20 bill in a nearby store.",
    "Philonise Floyd called on the UN to investigate systemic police violence against African Americans in the US.George Floyd’s brother on Wednesday begged the United Nations to help African Americans because “Black lives do not matter in the United States”, as the UN’s rights chief urged reparations for centuries of discrimination.Philonise Floyd made an impassioned speech via video-link to an urgent UN Human Rights Council debate on “systemic racism” in the US and beyond.Michelle Bachelet, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, said the “gratuitous brutality” of Floyd’s death in police custody encapsulated racism that harmed millions of people of African descent.She also urged countries to confront the legacy of slavery and colonialism and to make reparations.The council, based in Geneva, is debating a draft resolution pushing for Bachelet to investigate racism and police civil liberties violations against people of African descent in the US.President Donald Trump withdrew the US from the council two years ago.Floyd, a 46-year-old Black man, died in Minneapolis on May 25 after a white police officer – since fired and charged with second-degree murder – pressed his knee on Floyd’s neck for nearly nine minutes.Amateur video of the incident sparked demonstrations and calls to address systemic racism in the US and around the world.Philonise said his brother had been “tortured to death” as witnesses begged the officer to stop, “showing us Black people the same lesson, yet again: Black lives do not matter in the United States of America”.BREAKING: George Floyd's brother, Philonise Floyd, urges the UN to investigate police killings of Black people in America and help him get justice for his brother's murder. pic.twitter.com/HPyCjaFVWg— ACLU (@ACLU) June 17, 2020“You in the United Nations are your brothers’ and sisters’ keepers in America, and you have the power to help us get justice for my brother George Floyd.“I am asking you to help him. I am asking you to help me. I am asking you to help us Black people in America.”He urged them to establish an independent international commission of inquiry – one of the UN’s highest-level probes, generally reserved for major crises like the Syrian conflict.An initial text presented on Tuesday on behalf of 54 African countries had proposed such an inquiry.But the proposal was dropped, the resolution heavily watered down following stark opposition from Washington and some of its allies.It now calls on Bachelet and UN rights experts to “establish the facts and circumstances relating to the systemic racism, alleged violations of international human rights law and abuses against Africans and people of African descent” by law enforcement in the US and beyond – especially those incidents that resulted in deaths.The aim, it said, was “to ensure the accountability of perpetrators and redress for victims”.In her statement to the council, Bachelet said Floyd’s death had brought to a head the sense of outrage felt by overlooked people and the protests were “the culmination of many generations of pain”.“Behind today’s racial violence, systemic racism, and discriminatory policing lies the failure to acknowledge and confront the legacy of the slave trade and colonialism,” the former Chilean president said.She stressed the need to “make amends for centuries of violence and discrimination, including through formal apologies, truth-telling processes, and reparations in various forms.”On Tuesday, Trump issued an order to improve policing, calling for a ban on dangerous chokeholds – except if an officer’s life is at risk.The executive order encourages de-escalation training, better recruitment, sharing of data on police who have bad records, and money to support the police in complicated duties related to people with mental illnesses or drug issues.However, it stopped well short of demands made at nationwide protests.Andrew Bremberg, the US ambassador to the UN in Geneva, said his country was open in its commitment to addressing racial discrimination and injustice, citing Trump’s executive order.“We call upon all governments to demonstrate the same level of transparency and accountability,” he said.“Sadly, there are too many places in the world where governments commit grave violations of human rights and practice systematic racial discrimination while many of those assembled in Geneva are silent.”It remains to be seen whether the current draft resolution will pass.Australia, South Korea and the Netherlands all issued statements in the chamber that were broadly supportive of Washington’s outlook.“We have confidence in their transparent justice systems to address these issues appropriately,” Australia’s representative said.The UN Human Rights Council’s 47 members are due to vote on the resolution following the urgent debate, which was set to conclude on Thursday.Wednesday marks only the fifth time in the council’s 14-year history that it has agreed to hold an “urgent debate”, which is like a special session, but within a regular session of the council.",
    "Emotional Terrence Floyd tells mourners rioting and acts of violence ‘will not bring my brother back’.An emotional Terrence Floyd demanded that rioters stop violence and protest his brother George Floyd’s killing peacefully as he visited the scene in Minneapolis where George was asphyxiated by police officers.Crying, kneeling, and praying at the intersection where his older brother died, Terrence Floyd told supporters on Monday that rioting and acts of violence “will not bring my brother back”.“I understand you’re upset … but if I’m not over here wildin’ out, if I’m not over here blowing up stuff, if I’m not over here messing up my community – then what are y’all doing? Nothing, because that’s not going to bring my brother back at all,” Floyd said angrily over a loudspeaker.“So let’s do this another way. Let’s stop thinking that our voice don’t matter and vote … because it’s a lot of us and we still going to do this peacefully.”Floyd then led the crowd in a chant of, “Peace on the left and justice on the right.”Nationwide peaceful protests – which have descended into violence and rioting at times and have been met at times with excessive force by authorities – continued for a seventh day on Monday with calls for justice for Minnesota resident Floyd who died on May 25.US President Donald Trump threatened to deploy the military to states if their governors did not stamp out violent protests over police brutality, which have swept the country following the death of George Floyd, an unarmed Black man, in police custody.His announcement on Monday came as police under federal command forced back peaceful demonstrators with tear gas so he could walk to a nearby church and pose with a Bible.Trump said he was recommending that governors deploy the National Guard in sufficient numbers to “dominate the streets” and if they failed to do so, he said he would deploy the US military and “quickly solve the problem for them”.“We cannot allow the righteous cries of peaceful protesters to be drowned out by an angry mob,” he said at a White House briefing. “The biggest victims of the rioting are peace-loving citizens in our poorest communities and, as their president, I will fight to keep them safe.”Minutes before Trump began speaking, police and National Guard soldiers began aggressively forcing back hundreds of peaceful protesters who had gathered in Lafayette Park, across the street from the White House, where they were chanting against police brutality and Floyd’s death in Minneapolis.As Trump spoke, tear gas canisters could be heard exploding.With the area clear outside the White House, Trump then made an unexpected walk from his residence, across Lafayette Park – where protests have taken place for days – to the historic St John’s Episcopal Church, which was damaged during unrest the night before.He paused for an apparent photo-op, posing with members of his administration, and holding up a Bible.Al Jazeera’s Mike Hana, reporting from Washington, DC, said: “The timing and sequence of events point to one possible interpretation, that a peaceful protest was disrupted to allow the president of the United States a photo opportunity.”The president is calling out the American military against American citizens.He used the military to push out a peaceful protest so he could have a photo op at a church.It's all just a reality TV show for this president.Shameful.— Andrew Cuomo (@NYGovCuomo) June 1, 2020The moment was quickly decried by Trump’s critics as well as the bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Washington who said she was “outraged” by the the president’s visit.“He took the symbols sacred to our tradition and stood in front of a house of prayer in full expectation that would be a celebratory moment,” the Reverend Mariann Budde said in an interview with AP.Anger is running high across the country since Floyd died last week after being pinned to the pavement by a police officer who put his knee on the handcuffed Black man’s neck until he stopped breathing.Derek Chauvin, the police officer who knelt on Floyd’s neck, has been fired and charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Demonstrators are demanding the arrest of the three other officers involved in the incident, who have been fired.The state and private autopsy reports released on Monday both ruled Floyd’s death a homicide.The Hennepin County Medical Examiner said he died of “cardiopulmonary arrest complicating law enforcement subdual restraint, and neck compression”, according to a Minneapolis television station.Al Jazeera’s Jonh Hendren, reporting from Minneapolis, said the county coroner’s findings were “slightly contradicted” by the independent autopsy report that was also released on Monday.“That one was much stronger; it said he died directly as a result of force placed upon his breathing tube by the police officers and not just the one that has a knee on the neck, the other two who were sitting on his back also choked the air out of him by collapsing his lungs – according to that report, confirming the homicide.”In St Louis, four police officers were hit by gunfire after protests that started peacefully on Monday became violent overnight, with demonstrators smashing windows and stealing items from businesses and fires burning in the downtown area.The police department tweeted early Tuesday the officers were taken to a hospital with wounds that were not believed to be life-threatening. It was unclear who had fired the shots.Demonstrations erupted from Philadelphia, where hundreds of protesters spilled onto a highway in the heart of the city, to Atlanta, where police fired tear gas at demonstrators, to Nashville, where more than 60 National Guard soldiers put down their riot shields at the request of peaceful protesters who had gathered in front of Tennessee’s state Capitol to honour Floyd.Two people were killed during protests in the Chicago suburb of Cicero, authorities said, but provided no details. In Louisville, Kentucky, riot police firing tear gas scattered several hundred protesters from downtown, violently capping a day of mostly peaceful protests.A vehicle ploughed through a group of law enforcement officers at a demonstration in Buffalo, New York, injuring at least two.In New York City, where nightfall has brought widespread scenes of destruction, large crowds rallied peacefully in Times Square and Brooklyn during the day. Then, in the early evening, looters rushed into a Nike store in Manhattan and protesters smashed storefront windows near Rockefeller Center.New York joined other cities around the country in imposing a curfew after days of unrest.Protesters have remained undeterred by curfews and the presence of the US National Guard in some cities.More curfews were imposed on the nation’s biggest city, New York, as well as Washington, DC as they brace for several more days of protests.",
    "In street protests, statements, sermons and webinars, US Muslims have rallied against racism and discussed reforms.In the wake of George Floyd’s death in police custody, dozens of Muslim organisations in the United States have come together to call for reform to policing practices and to support Black-led organisations.“The victimization of unarmed Black Muslims has a long and troubling history,” said a coalition statement signed by more than 90 civil rights, advocacy, community and faith organisations and released on Monday. “As American Muslims, we will draw on our diversity, our strength, and our resilience to demand these reforms because Black lives matter.”Proposed changes include prohibiting racial profiling and manoeuvers that restrict the flow of blood or oxygen to the brain, such as chokeholds; making it legally easier for prosecutors to hold law enforcement accountable; and redirecting police funding “into community health, education, employment and housing programs”.The statement also calls for the establishment of “a federal standard that use of force be reserved as a last resort, only when absolutely necessary” and after exhausting all reasonable options.“These demands are a floor for our groups and not a ceiling. Some would call for much more,” said Farhana Khera, executive director of Muslim Advocates, one of the statement’s co-conveners.“We’re also urging all American Muslims to call their members of Congress right now and to demand a stronger response from them.”Today, 95 America Muslim groups issued a joint statement affirming that #BlackLivesMatter and calling for concrete action to end anti-Black police violence: https://t.co/esLm1rFf4a— Muslim Advocates (@MuslimAdvocates) June 15, 2020Like members of other faith groups, many Muslims in the US have joined in the outrage unleashed after Floyd, an unarmed Black man, died after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed a knee to his neck.Groups from multiple denominations across faiths have publicly called for action against racism and aligned with the goals of peaceful demonstrators.In street protests, statements, sermons and webinars, US Muslims have rallied against racism and discussed reforms.“Muslim American organizations are committed to advocating at all levels to put an end to excessive use of force which has led to the murders of countless Black Americans,” said Iman Awad, legislative director of Emgage Action, one of the statement’s signatories. “Our message is that we will continue to fight but most importantly uplift the work being done by our Black leaders.”Muslims in America are ethnically and racially diverse and Floyd’s death has also reinvigorated conversations about the treatment and representation of Black Muslims in their own faith communities.“I’m hopeful and heartened by the number and diversity of groups that have signed on,” said Kameelah Rashad, president of Muslim Wellness Foundation, also a co-convener. “That says to me that there’s at least recognition that we as a whole can no longer separate Islamophobia, anti-Black racism, surveillance, and violence. People are reconciling with the notion that means our struggles are intertwined.”Now, she said, is the time for action.“It’s vital that non-Black Muslims develop a respect for the resilience and resistance of Black people.”The statement said: “Black people are often marginalized within the broader Muslim community. And when they fall victim to police violence, non-Black Muslims are too often silent, which leads to complicity.”Moving forward, American Muslim communities must make space for Black-led organisations, Awad said.Also, “we must commit to having leadership positions which reflect the diversity of our faith community,” she said. “We cannot be successful until we have all voices represented at all levels within our organizational structures and our communities must do better.”The statement said the demands represent only a “down payment” on needed reforms.“If this deep-seated discrimination cannot be done away with through reform, then these systems will need to be abolished and re-imagined entirely,” the statement said.",
    "The ambitious bill, which bans chokeholds and combats racial profiling, has faced pushback from moderate Democrats.A sweeping police reform package that bans chokeholds and aims to combat racial profiling was passed by the United States House of Representatives on Wednesday, days before the trial in the killing of George Floyd, an unarmed Black man, kicks off.The bill, which passed 220-212 votes late on Wednesday, was named after Floyd, whose deadly encounter with police in Minnesota in May of last year sparked nationwide racial justice protests.Floyd died aged 46 when then-Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin pressed his knee on the victim’s neck for more than eight minutes.“Nearly one year ago, George Floyd gasped his last words, ‘I can’t breathe’, and ignited a nationwide reckoning on the racial injustice and police brutality in America,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said before the vote.“This legislation will not erase centuries of systemic racism and excessive policing in America,” but it takes a “tremendous step” towards stopping the violence and improving relations between law enforcement and communities they serve, she added.The George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, which has the support of President Joe Biden but is expected to face hurdles in the US Senate, where the Democratic party holds a razor-thin majority.It would also ban “qualified immunity” for police, policies that shield on-duty officers from being held personally accountable in civil rights lawsuits if their conduct does not explicitly break the law.The bill passed mostly along party lines, with just one Republican supporting it and two Democrats opposing it.Police reform has previously caused inter-party conflict for Democrats, with some blaming calls by some progressives to “defund the police” for the party’s losses in the chamber during the 2020 election. The bill does not slash police funding.Biden told legislators on Wednesday that he “strongly” supports the House version of the bill, although the legislation will likely be watered down in the 100-member Senate, where Democrats hold 50 seats. Sixty votes will be needed there to pass the legislation.A previous version of the bill had passed the House last year but languished in the then Republican-controlled Senate.Floyd’s family heralded the House vote in a statement from their lawyers.“This represents a major step forward to reform the relationship between police officers and communities of color and impose accountability on law enforcement officers,” lawyers Ben Crump and Antonio Romanucci said.The passage comes as the trial for officer Derek Chauvin, who was captured on video kneeling on Floyd’s neck for more than eight minutes, is set to begin on Monday.Chauvin, who is being tried separately from the three other officers charged in Floyd’s death, faces second-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter charges.During debate on the bill on Wednesday, Representative Ilhan Omar, who represents the area where Floyd was killed, said residents are still reeling from the incident.“My city is not an outlier, but rather an example of the inequalities our country has struggled with for centuries,” she said, asking if her colleagues will “have the moral courage to pursue justice and secure meaningful change?”",
    "Derek Chauvin, who knelt on Floyd’s neck, faces second-degree murder charge, other 3 face aiding and abetting charges.The fired US police officer who knelt on George Floyd’s neck will face a more serious murder charge, and three other sacked officers will be charged as aiding and abetting in the death of the 46-year-old unarmed Black man that triggered eight days of nationwide protests, court documents and prosecutors said on Wednesday.Floyd died after Derek Chauvin, a white officer, knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes on May 25 in Minneapolis, Minnesota. In a video of the incident, Floyd can be repeatedly yelling “I can’t breathe” before going motionless, with Chauvin’s knee still on his neck. Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said he was charging Chauvin, 44, with second-degree murder in addition to the third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter charges levelled against him last week.The new charge can carry a sentence of up to 40 years, 15 years longer than the maximum sentence for third-degree murder, according to court documents. The other three former officers who were involved in the incident – Thomas Lane, J Alexander Kueng and Tou Thao – face charges of aiding and abetting murder and arrest warrants have been issued by Ellison, according to the documents. At least one of the three is in custody, law enforcement said in a news conference on Tuesday. Ellison called the protests unleashed by the death “dramatic and necessary” and said Floyd “should be here and he is not.”“His life had value, and we will seek justice,” Ellison said. “The very fact we have filed these charges means we believe in them.”Benjamin Crump, one of the lawyers for Floyd’s family, said in a statement that it is “a bittersweet moment for the family of George Floyd”, calling it a “significant step forward on the road to justice“.“We are deeply gratified that Attorney General Keith Ellison took decisive action in this case, arresting and charging all the officers involved in George Floyd’s death and upgrading the charge against Derek Chauvin to felony second-degree murder,” Crump said. “[W]e are gratified that this important action was brought before George Floyd’s body was laid to rest.”FAMILY’S REACTION: This is a bittersweet moment. We are deeply gratified that @AGEllison took decisive action, arresting & charging ALL the officers involved in #GeorgeFloyd's death & upgrading the charge against Derek Chauvin to felony second-degree murder. #JusticeForGeorge pic.twitter.com/jTfXFHpsYl— Ben Crump (@AttorneyCrump) June 3, 2020Crump added that the officers knew they could “act with impunity” given the Minneapolis Police Department’s “widespread and prolonged pattern and practice” of violating people’s rights.The deadly arrest set off mass protests against police brutality across the country, and worldwide,At the Minneapolis intersection where Floyd was killed, protesters cautiously welcomed the charges, saying “no one is above the law”. “It took way too long with the evidence they had on camera, but they got them,” said Minneapolis resident Kevin Jong.“It’s just the beginning,” he told Al Jazeera. Others were sceptical that the four would be convicted and there would be meaningful reform. “I’m not psychic, I just been Black all my life, man,” said John Thompson. “So, don’t think for one minute, that we not gonna see another police-involved murder here in this state,” he added, pointing to the police shooting of his “best friend” Philando Castillo, who was killed in 2016. The arrests of all four officers was a key demand of protests. It is unclear whether the demonstrations will continue at the level of they have over the last week. But protesters are demanding justice for not just Floyd, but all Black people who have been killed by police, including Breonna Taylor, who was shot dead by police as she laid in her bed in Louisville, Kentucky, in March. Taylor’s mother is calling on the police department to fire the officers involved. Police and other law enforcement agencies have come under heavy criticism for the way they have responded to the protests, which have largely been peaceful, but have at times turned violent as night falls and curfews imposed to quell unrest have taken effect. Thousands have been arrested and many injured. Law enforcement agencies have defended the crackdown, saying they are responding to violent protesters and pointing to looting, vandalism and fires that have taken place. US President Donald Trump has threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act to use active-duty military to disperse the protests, drawing criticism from across the political spectrum.Defense Secretary Mark Esper said on Tuesday that he did not support such a threat. With additional reporting by Lucien Formichella in Minneapolis, Minnesota. ",
    "Barr rejects Democrats’ assertions of racism in US policing and denies he favoured Trump’s friends in Mueller trials.United States Attorney General William Barr appeared before the House Judiciary Committee on July 28 for the first time since taking office in February 2019.Barr’s appearance came amid the deployment of federal law enforcement officers against crowds of protesters in Portland, Washington, DC, and other American cities.Barr’s tenure as the top law enforcement official in the US has been controversial. Some Democratic politicians have called for Barr’s impeachment. More than a thousand former Justice Department lawyers have signed a letter urging him to step down. Four former presidents of the DC Bar Association have called for a professional ethics probe.In the hearing, Democrats, who control a majority in the US House of Representatives, challenged Barr on a wide range of issues including whether he believes there is systemic racism in the US and whether he has favoured the president’s friends in prosecutions stemming from the Mueller probe.Here are key excerpts of what Barr said during the five-hour hearing:“Police forces today are far more diverse than they’ve ever been. And there are both more Black police chiefs and more Black officers in the ranks. Although the death of George Floyd at the hands of the police was a shocking event, the fact is that these events are, fortunately, quite rare.”“As one prominent Black professional in Washington said to me, African Americans will often feel treated as suspects first and citizens second, and I think these concerns are legitimate. At the same time, it would be an oversimplification to treat the problem is rooted in some deep-seated racism generally infecting our police departments. It seems far more likely that the problem stems from a complex mix of factors which can be addressed with focused attention over time.”“Unfortunately, some have chosen to respond to George Floyd’s death in a far less productive way by demonising the police, promoting slogans like ‘all cops are bastards’ and making grossly irresponsible programme proposals to defund the police. The demonisation of the police is not only unfair and inconsistent with principles of all people should be treated as individuals, but gravely injurious to the inner-city communities. When communities turn on and pillory the police, officers naturally become more risk-averse and crime rates soar. So, unfortunately, we are seeing that now in many of our cities, the threat to Black lives posed by crime on the streets is massively greater than any threat posed by police misconduct.”“In the wake of George Floyd’s death, violent rioters and anarchists have hijacked legitimate protests to wreak senseless havoc and destruction on innocent victims. The current situation in Portland is a telling example. Every night for the past two months, a mob of hundreds of rioters have laid siege to the federal courthouse and other nearby federal property. The rioters have come equipped for a fight, armed with powerful slingshots, tasers, sledgehammers, saws, knives, rifles and explosive devices. Inside the courthouse are a relatively small number of federal law enforcement personnel, charged with the defensive mission to protect the courthouse. What unfolds nightly around the courthouse cannot reasonably be called protest. It is, by any objective measure, an assault on the government of the United States.”“However, in the intervening time, we saw violent crime continuing to rise and a lot of that was triggered by the events after the death of George Floyd. So we did reboot the programme after COVID started breaking and we could commit the law enforcement resources to actually accomplish the mission, which is to reduce violent crime. Now, I regret that COVID interrupted our law enforcement activities, but it doesn’t obviate the fact that there is serious violent crime in these cities. These police departments and mayors have been asking us for help and we have put in additional federal agents and investigators to help deal with it.”“I’m a member of the cabinet. And there’s an election going on, obviously, the topic comes up in cabinet meetings and other things. It shouldn’t be a surprise that topic of the election was discussed.“I’m not going to get into my discussions with the president, but I’ve made it clear that I would like to pick the cities based on law enforcement need and based on neutral criteria.”“Stone was prosecuted under me. And I said all along, I thought that was a righteous prosecution. I thought he should go to jail. And I thought the judge’s sentence was correct. But the line prosecutors were trying to advocate for a sentence that was more than twice anyone else in a similar position had ever served and this is a 67-year-old man, first time offender, no violence, and they were trying to put him in jail for seven to nine years. And I wasn’t going to advocate that, because that is not the rule of law. I agree the president’s friends don’t deserve special breaks but they also don’t deserve to be treated more harshly than other people.”“Well, I would just say I asked another US Attorney in St Louis, who had 10 years in the FBI and 10 years in the Department of Justice as a career prosecutor, to take a look at it. And he determined based on documents that had not been provided to the Flynn side and not been provided to the court, that in fact, there was no basis to investigate Flynn. And furthermore, it was clearly established by the documents that the FBI agents who interviewed him did not believe that they thought he was lying.”“What the counsel concluded was that the only purpose of the interview – the only purpose – was to try to catch him in saying something that they could then say was a lie. So then, therefore, the interview was untethered to any legitimate investigation.”“There was unprecedented rioting right around the White House, very violent. During that time … we had around 90 officers injured. I’m talking about things like concussions, one was operated on and so forth … It was so bad that – as it’s been reported – the Secret Service recommended the president go down to the shelter. We had a breach of the Treasury Department. The historical building on Lafayette Park was burned down. St John’s was set on fire. Bricks were thrown at the police repeatedly. They took crowbars and pried up the pavers at Lafayette Park and threw those at the police. Balloons of caustic liquids were thrown on the police. And it was clear when I arrived at the White House on Monday, there was total consensus that we couldn’t allow that to happen so close to the White House, that kind of rioting. And therefore we had to move the perimeter out one block and push it up toward I Street. And there was already a plan in being at that point that the Park Police and the Secret Service had worked out the night before, which was to put the perimeter further away and then give them time to put a non-scaleable fence across the northern part of the park.”“During the day, the factors that led to the timing of it was that movement was going to be made as soon as there were enough units in place to actually perform it and units were very slow in getting into place throughout the day, much to my frustration, because I wanted to move before there was a big buildup of demonstrators, and also the fencing had to be delivered. And when those things were accomplished the tactical commander in charge of the Park Police proceeded with the movement of pushing the perimeter. So this was something conceived long before and didn’t turn on the nature of the crowd, although I would say the crowd was very unruly. And while the tactical considerations were made by the Park Police, they tried to respond to the situation.”“To say that this had to do with the photo op, I don’t mean to analogise this to a military operation, but it’s akin to saying that we invaded the Philippines in World War II so Douglas MacArthur could walk through the surf on the beach, one follows the other but we did not invade the Philippines so that MacArthur could walk to the beach.”",
    "Same actors seen promoting products designed to make people’s skin lighter, or maintaining silence on domestic issues.Several Bollywood stars have been labelled “hypocrites” after speaking out against racism to lend support to global protests while promoting products in India designed to make people’s skin lighter.The actors were also trolled and accused of “cowardice” for their refusal to call out the attacks on India’s minorities, mainly Muslims, while protesting against the killing of George Floyd in the United States.A series of A-list Bollywood actresses, including Priyanka Chopra, shared posts on social media to protest against the death of Floyd who died in police custody after a white officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes.“End this race war here in the US, and around the world. Wherever you live, whatever your circumstances, NO ONE deserves to die, especially at the hands of another because of their skin colour,” Chopra, 37, posted on Instagram.⁣⁣People were quick to call her out on social media for previously promoting an “intense fairness moisturiser”.They also pointed at her role in a 2008 Hindi film, Fashion, in which she is ashamed of having sex with a black man.List of Indian actors who are speaking on BLM and their fairness cream ads, a thread : pic.twitter.com/yUeRNLch6U— anti pigeon (@aluminiummaiden) May 31, 2020“Thanks for speaking out for black lives.

It takes courage to bring your cowardice to the fore when you tweet for American lives but can’t tweet for Indian lives,” tweeted Omar Abdullah, former chief minister of the erstwhile Jammu and Kashmir state, now divided into two federal territories.Others asked why the Bollywood actors do not take a stand on contentious issues such as the “anti-Muslim” Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) passed by the government late last year, or the protests and violence that followed after the passage of the law.The CAA allows Indian citizenship for non-Muslim minorities from the neighbouring Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan. Critics say the law violates India’s secular constitution.“So our starlets who did not even whisper about the anti-Muslim carnage in Delhi, the spate of lynchings, the citizenship bill, the arrests of academics and intellectuals are outraging with the hashtag #BLACK_LIVES_MATTER. PUKE,” journalist Rana Ayyub posted on Twitter.Many social media users also called out the “hypocrisy” behind Bollywood actors expressing outrage over the death of a pregnant elephant in Kerala state, while maintaining silence on the imprisonment of activist Safoora Zargar, who was arrested in April despite being pregnant for protesting against the CAA.Maybe animals are less wild and humans less human.

Its death triggered a political controversy after right-wing forces attempted to communalise the issue by suggesting the culprit could be a Muslim, forcing Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan to flag a “hate campaign” over the issue.Zargar, 27, is accused of being a “conspirator” behind the February violence in the Indian capital, in which 53 people were killed.She has been charged under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act, 2019 (UAPA), a stringent “anti-terror” law and has been denied bail thrice so far despite her health condition amid the coronavirus pandemic.“Where has the outrage and empathy we rightly felt at the death of the elephant in Kerala gone in the case of Safoora Zargar, the Jamia student held in an overcrowded jail at COVID time?” asked filmmaker Bedabrata Pain in a column titled Human Cruelty and a Tale of Two Pregnancies for The Wire news website.Hypocrisy at its finest. Bollywood celebrities endorsing colorism and now using BLM as an accessory lashed out on social media about the devastating accident causing the death of a pregnant elephant.

    "Proposal is expected to ban police chokeholds, racial profiling, require nationwide use of body cameras, and more.Prime Minister Boris Johnson would not agree that Britain is a racist country but acknowledges there is still more to do to combat cases of discrimination and racism, his spokesman said.“The PM doesn’t doubt that there continues to be discrimination and racism but would not agree that this is a racist country. We have made very significant progress on this issue but there remains more to do,” the spokesman told reporters.“The PM is absolutely committed to continuing efforts to stamp out racism and discrimination.” George Floyd’s family has appealed to the United Nations to intervene in his case and to send recommendations for systemic police reform in the US, CNN reported.According to a press release, a June 3 letter to the UN Working Group on the Rights of People of African Descent, the family urged the UN to investigate Floyd’s death.It also encouraged the US government to press federal criminal charges against the officers involved, and make reforms including de-escalating techniques, independent prosecutions and autopsies for every police killing, reported CNN.Protesters are pushing to “defund the police” over the death of George Floyd and other Black Americans killed by law enforcement.Their chant has become a rallying cry – but what does “defund the police” mean? The answer is not necessarily about gutting police department budgets.Read more here.The editorial page head of the New York Times has resigned after his decision to publish an op-ed – by a US senator who called for military force against anti-racism protesters – drew online fury and criticism from many of the paper’s staffers.James Bennet, the editorial page editor since May 2016, faced intense backlash after initially defending the column headlined Send in The Military by Republican US Senator Tom Cotton.Read more here.US congressional Democrats plan to unveil a sweeping package of legislation to combat police violence and racial injustice, after two weeks of protests across the nation sparked by George Floyd’s death in Minneapolis police custody.The proposal is expected to ban police chokeholds and racial profiling, require nationwide use of body cameras, subject police to civilian review boards and abolish the legal doctrine known as qualified immunity, which protects police from civil litigation, according to congressional sources.“It is time for police culture in many departments to change,” Congressional Black Caucus Chairwoman Representative Karen Bass, told CNN on Sunday.House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Senator Kamala Harris along with Bass are expected to discuss the bill at a 10:30 a.m. ET (1430 GMT) briefing.“The world is full of idiots,” said ABBA’s Bjorn Ulvaeus, as he condemned critics of the Black Lives Matter movement and voiced his support of the worldwide protests against racism and police brutality.“The solidarity that we see in the streets of the cities around the world now should give us hope,” the musician said in a phone-recorded video given to Reuters..The musician condemned those without “the imagination or will to put themselves in the place of a coloured woman or man”, adding that he believes such people to be in the minority.Former Minneapolis officer Derek Chauvin, who pressed his knee on George Floyd’s neck for nearly nine minutes as the man begged for his life, will make his first court appearance Monday afternoon, CNN reported.Chauvin was arrested last month and charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Prosecutors also added a second-degree murder charge.The other three officers involved in Floyd’s death – Thomas Lane, J. Alexander Kueng and Tou Thao – were charged with aiding and abetting second-degree murder and aiding and abetting second-degree manslaughter.The toppling by anti-racism protesters of a statue of a slave trader Edward Colston in the English port city of Bristol has given new urgency to a debate about how Britain should confront some of the darkest chapters of its history.Statues of figures from Britain’s imperialist past have in recent years become the subject of controversies between those who argue that such monuments merely reflect history and those who say they glorify racism.Many people criticised the government for its reactions to the incident.UK interior minister Priti Patel called the felling of the statue an “utterly disgraceful” distraction from the protesters’ cause, while policing minister Kit Malthouse denounced “mobs just turning up and deciding to do whatever they like”.A retired US Navy captain used derogatory language and racial slurs during a conversation with his wife that was accidentally live streamed on Facebook, reported CNN.Scott Bethmann said he was “mortified” after the leak and was working to be a better person and resigned from the US Naval Academy Alumni Association board after the incident, according to a statement from the alumni association and a family spokesperson.Bethmann and his wife Nancy were live on Facebook for more than 30 minutes, discussing recent events around the country, according to audio obtained by CNN affiliate WJXT. Violence against peaceful protesters and journalists is unacceptable, whether in the United States or elsewhere, France’s foreign minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said in a newspaper interview published.Asked about protests and rioting that have swept across US cities since the death of unarmed black man George Floyd in police custody in Minneapolis, Le Drian told Le Telegramme that it was necessary to let people demonstrate freely.“Any act of violence committed against peaceful protesters or journalists is unacceptable, in the United States or elsewhere,” he told the Brittany regional newspaper.National Guard troops will be pulled out of California cities where they’ve been deployed for a week of protests over the death of George Floyd, officials announced.The announcement came as peaceful demonstrations again popped up across the state, including one on horseback and another on wheels, as protesters continue to call for police reforms.“After nearly a week assisting civil authorities on the streets of California, soldiers with the California National Guard will begin transitioning back to their home armories,” the Cal Guard said in a statement. A timeline for the pullout was not provided.Mitt Romney marched in a protest against police mistreatment of minorities in the nation’s capital, making him the first known Republican senator to do so.Romney, who represents Utah, posted a tweet showing him wearing a mask as he walked with Black Lives Matter protesters in Washington. Above the photo he wrote: Black Lives Matter.Romney, who was walking with a Christian group, told NBC News that he needed to be there.“We need a voice against racism, we need many voices against racism and against brutality,” he said.Black Lives Matter. pic.twitter.com/JpXUFlxH2J— Mitt Romney (@MittRomney) June 7, 2020Artists painted the words “End Racism Now” on a downtown street, the Raleigh News & Observer reported.Charman Driver, former chair of the Contemporary Art Museum on Martin Street, where the painting is located, called it “a very painful totem.” The street leads to Confederate monuments on State Capitol grounds, which have been spotlighted as offensive during protests.The painting was applied when a city engineer met the artists and brought barricades to block off the street.“We did it. And it’s wonderful. And we feel really good about it. Our voices are being heard, but it’s not enough,” Driver said.Seattle City Council members sharply criticised Mayor Jenny Durkan and Police Chief Carmen Best after police used flash bang devices and pepper spray to disperse protesters a day after Durkan and Best said they were trying to de-escalate tensions.Authorities said rocks, bottles and explosives were thrown at officers in the city’s Capitol Hill neighborhood Saturday night. Police said via Twitter that several officers were injured by “improvised explosives.”The mayhem in the Capitol Hill neighborhood came on the ninth consecutive day of George Floyd protests in the city. It followed a large, peaceful demonstration earlier.Authorities say a man drove a car at George Floyd protesters in Seattle Sunday night, hit a barricade then exited the vehicle brandishing a pistol.At least one person was injured. The Seattle Fire Department said the victim was a 27-year-old male who was shot and taken to a hospital in stable condition.Video taken by a reporter for The Seattle Times showed part of the scene in the city’s Capitol Hill neighborhood, where demonstrators have gathered for days near a police precinct. Fans of BTS have matched the hugely popular South Korean boy band’s $1 million donation to Black Lives Matter after a social media campaign around the hashtag MatchAMillion.Fans, known by the acronym ARMY (Adorable Representation MC for Youth) had given $1,007,518 as of 9:47am (00:47 GMT) on Monday, according One In An Army (OIAA) which runs fan donation campaigns.“We’re so proud that ARMY have once again channelled their power for good and are making a real impact in the fight against anti-black racism,” OIAA said in a statement.“We stand in solidarity with black ARMY. They’re an important part of our family. And we stand with black people everywhere. Your voices deserve to be heard.” With New York City poised to reopen after a more than two-month coronavirus shutdown, officials lifted a curfew that was in place amid protests of police brutality and racial injustice. But they also urged that demonstrators be tested for COVID-19.“Get a test. Get a test,” New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo told people who have been participating in rallies and marches in memory of George Floyd. “I would act as if you were exposed, and I would tell people you are interacting with, assume I am positive for the virus.”Cuomo said the state would open 15 testing sites dedicated to protesters so they can get results quickly. His call for demonstrators to proceed carefully is similar to those made in Seattle, San Francisco and Atlanta following massive demonstrations, with free testing for protesters.A majority of councillors in Minneapolis have told a rally in the city that they want to break up the city’s police department.“It is clear that our system of policing is not keeping our communities safe,” said Lisa Bender, the council president who was among nine of the council’s 12 members who took part in the rally. “Our efforts at incremental reform have failed, period.” Bender said she and the other council members at the rally were committed to “end policing as we know it and recreate systems that actually keep us safe.”  Council member Jeremiah Ellison promied the council would “dismantle” the police department.Anti-racism protests in Britain have been “subverted by thuggery”, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said, warning those responsible would be held to account.Tens of thousands took to the streets of London on Sunday, rallying for a second day running to condemn police brutality after the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. As numbers dwindled, some protesters tussled with police.Peaceful protesters have gathered again near the White House in the 13consecutive day of protests in the country. In one instance, protesters implored a black US Secret Service officer to take a knee in solidarity with their demonstration against racism and brutality by law enforcement. “I appreciate all of this. … I’m still black. You see what I’m saying? You guys are still fighting for my rights,” the unidentified officer told the protesters through a fence outside the Treasury building in Washington, in an exchange captured by Reuters TV. “What I’m saying is, technically we just can’t do that,” he said.A white Virginia police officer was charged with assault and battery in connection with the use of a stun gun on a black man, authorities have announced.Fairfax County police Officer Tyler Timberlake was trying to get the man into an ambulance to go to a detox centre on Friday, according to body camera video shown at a news conference late Saturday.Timberlake is seen striking the man with a stun gun and then getting on top of him, along with the officer wearing the body camera. Once Timberlake is on top of the man, he presses the stun gun into the back of his neck and fires again.Scuffles have broken out between police and protesters in central London by the arches that effectively connect the Foreign Office and the Treasury. Objects were thrown at police lining up at the three arches that bridges the connection just off Whitehall, which is also near the offices of Prime Minister Boris Johnson. Many of the demonstrators, who gathered earlier Sunday outside the US embassy just south of the River Thames, have moved towards central London, where clashes also took place Saturday.US Attorney General William Barr has defended the clearing of mostly peaceful protesters from Lafayette Square on Monday, denying it was done for President Donald Trump to have a photo shoot in front of a local church.Barr, in an interview on CBS’s “Face the Nation” programme, insisted that, despite contradictory reports from many of those present, that protesters were “rowdy and non-compliant” and some had thrown projectiles, justifying the aggressive response. He said the clearing was meant to increase the perimeter around the White House and was unrelated to Trump’s photo session.US President Donald Trump told his advisors at one point this past week he wanted 10,000 troops to deploy to the Washington, DC area to halt civil unrest over the killing of a black man by Minneapolis police,a senior US official told Reuters news agency. The account of Trump’s demand during a heated Oval Office conversation on Monday shows how close the president may have come to fulfilling his threat to deploy active duty troops, despite opposition from Pentagon leadership.At the meeting, Defense Secretary Mark Esper, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Mark Milley, and Attorney General William Barr recommended against such a deployment, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. The meeting was “contentious,” the official added.Offering rare open support by a leader in Europe, Serbia’s president says US President Donald Trump faces “a serious and tough enemy” as he tries to quell massive protests over the violent death of George Floyd.Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic told local Pancevo TV on Sunday, “I hope the US will come out of the crisis.” He also said he wishes Trump “the best of luck.”Vucic, a populist and former ultra-nationalist, also addressed the release of Serbian soccer player Aleksandar Katai by the LA Galaxy soccer club after a series of social media posts by his wife in which she urged police to “kill” protesters and referred to protesters as “disgusting cattle.”Vucic says the team’s decision “only speaks about the chase and chaos that has been conducted against President Trump.”Minneapolis was among several cities that had policies on the books requiring police officers to intervene to stop colleagues from using unreasonable force, but that could not save George Floyd.Law enforcement experts say such rules will always run up against entrenched police culture and the fear of being ostracised and branded a “rat”.Read more here. Chicago has lifted its 9 PM curfew, according to a tweet by the city’s mayor. The curfew was put in place on June 1 as protests began to sweep the country. “The curfew is lifted effective immediately and going forward,” Mayor Lori Lightfood wrote. “I know this time in our city and our country has been difficult for us all, and I’m grateful to our residents for working together to navigate this challenging time.”The curfew is lifted effective immediately.

Images on social media show protesters appearing to kneel on the statue’s neck, recalling how a white Minneapolis police officer used his knee to pin down George Floyd’s neck before his death. Colston, who was born in 1636, has been a controversial figure in Bristol. Among efforts to “decolonise” the city have been calls to remove his name from its biggest music venue, Colston Hall.https://twitter.com/shaunking/status/1269661838528086019?ref_src=twsrc%5EtfwDemocratic US presidential candidate Joe Biden will travel to Houston and meet with the family of George Floyd, two weeks after Floyd’s death in police custody triggered nationwide protests over racial injustice, two senior aides said.Biden is expected to offer his sympathies to Floyd’s relatives and record a video message for Floyd’s funeral service, which is taking place later in the day in Houston, the aides said. He is not expected to attend the service to avoid any disruption to mourners that could be caused by his Secret Service protective detail.Floyd’s body arrived in Houston on Sunday, officials said. US demonstrators toppled a statue of Confederate General Williams Carter Wickham from its pedestal after a day of mostly peaceful demonstrations across Virginia on Saturday.The Richmond Times-Dispatch reported that most of the demonstrators had already dispersed when a rope was tied around the Confederate statue, which has stood since 1891 in Richmond’s Monroe Park. In 2017, some of Wickham’s descendants urged the city to remove the statue. Confederate monuments are a major flashpoint in Virginia and across the US.US President Donald Trump has ordered the withdrawal of National Guard troops from the streets of Washington after days of protests over the police killing of George Floyd.“I have just given an order for our National Guard to start the process of withdrawing from Washington, DC, now that everything is under perfect control,” he tweeted.     “They will be going home, but can quickly return, if needed. Far fewer protesters showed up last night than anticipated!”     Colin Powell, who served as America’s top military officer and top diplomat under Republican presidents, has said he will vote for Democrat Joe Biden, accusing Donald Trump of drifting from the US constitution.     In a scathing indictment of Trump on CNN, Powell denounced the US president as a danger to democracy whose lies and insults have diminished America in the eyes of the world.     “We have a constitution. We have to follow that constitution. And the president’s drifted away from it,” Powell said.A former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Powell was the latest in a series of retired top military officers to publicly criticise Trump’s handling of the protests.Thousands of people took to the streets of Barcelona, Madrid and Rome in support of the Black Lives Matter movement, which has drawn large protests against racism and police brutality around the world.The rally in Rome’s sprawling People’s Square was noisy but peaceful, with the majority of protesters wearing masks to protect against coronavirus.More demonstrations were being held Sunday across the United Kingdom, including one outside the US Embassy in London.Some 300 Thais and foreigners in Thailand and elsewhere joined an online protest against racism on Sunday, adding their voices to global calls for justice for Floyd.With coronavirus restrictions, protesters with “I Can’t Breathe” messages on their arms and placards gathered on the video-meeting platform Zoom to emphasize the call in Thailand as they watched the video clip of Floyd’s last moments.A Black Lives Matter protest was cancelled due to coronavirus restrictions in Hong Kong, but a group of demonstrators showed up in front of US embassy on Sunday.“It’s a global issue,” Quinland Anderson, a 28-year-old UK citizen living in Hong Kong who was at the protest told The Associated Press news agency.Hong Kong resident and protester Max Percy, 24, said no human should have “suffered” as Floyd did.Protesters gathered in a group of eight, which is in accordance with the limit of people who are allowed to meet under current coronavirus restrictions, and took turns to give speeches outside of the embassy.New York City is lifting its curfew spurred by protests against police brutality ahead of schedule, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced on Sunday morning.The 8pm citywide curfew, New York’s first in decades, had been set to remain in effect through to at least Sunday, with the city planning to lift it at the same time it enters the first phase of reopening after more than two months of shutdowns because of the coronavirus.“Yesterday and last night we saw the very best of our city,” de Blasio tweeted in his announcement of the curfew’s end “effective immediately”. “Tomorrow we take the first big step to restart.”The move followed New York City police pulling back on enforcing the curfew on Saturday as thousands took to the streets and parks to protest police brutality, sparked by Floyd’s death.New York City: We are lifting the curfew, effective immediately.

    "Face masks and outdoor air may have helped reduce the spread of COVID-19 during large anti-racism protests in the US.It has been 16 days since the killing of George Floyd – an unarmed Black man who was pinned to the ground by a white police officer in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The officer, who has since been fired and charged for murder, knelt on Floyd’s neck for nearly nine minutes, as Floyd pleaded “I can’t breathe”.Since then, tens of thousands of people across the United States and abroad have taken to the streets demanding justice for Floyd and an end to systemic racism. Some of the largest US demonstrations, with more than 10,000 people, occurred in the nation’s capital, Washington, DC. There, protesters waved placards with the words “No justice! No peace!”, “I can’t breathe” and “Black lives matter”.With such large crowds, by now, you could possibly expect to see an increase in the number of registered coronavirus infections – but that has not been the case so far. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), COVID-19 symptoms may appear two to 14 days after exposure to the virus.To see whether or not there is any visible relationship between protests and coronavirus cases, we looked at the number of daily confirmed COVID-19 cases provided by Johns Hopkins University and compared it with a list of cities where large protests are known to have taken place. In such an analysis, the best we can do is point out whether there is a correlation between the two data sets. This is very different from proving cause and effect – especially given the multitude of factors that contribute to the spread of the virus.The US is a very large country, both in population and geography. Across the country, the average number of daily confirmed cases has gradually been on the decline. Averages can, however, be misleading. According to data compiled by the New York Times, more than a third of the US’s 50 states are still seeing an increase in daily infections. Different cities are at very different stages in the fight against the pandemic, yet all 50 states have now taken steps to reopen following weeks of coronavirus restrictions.   While there were hundreds of cities across the country that witnessed protests, thousands more did not. To account for this, we looked at the numbers from a few key locations where large protests are known to have taken place.Minneapolis is located in Hennepin County. The Midwestern county currently has 9,567 confirmed coronavirus cases. The city has seen sustained protests since May 26, the day after Floyd was killed. Over the past 15 days, new coronavirus cases have decreased compared to the 15 days prior. Daily confirmed cases (May 10 – May 24): 3,360Daily confirmed cases (May 26 – June 9): 2,146Minnesota stay-at-home order: Started March 27, ended May 4.The US capital has recorded 9,474 confirmed coronavirus cases since March. Demonstrators have amassed near the White House for 13 consecutive days with more protests expected this week. DC, too, has seen a decrease in COVID-19 cases over the past 15 days.Daily confirmed cases (May 10 – May 24): 1,838Daily confirmed cases (May 26 – June 9): 1,140DC stay-at-home order: Started April 1, ended May 29.New York City is the US’s most populated city. It also has been one of those that have been hit the hardest by the pandemic. The East Coast city has recorded 207,993 cases of COVID-19 this year. On Sunday, Mayor Bill de Blasio lifted the city-wide night curfew that he ordered a week earlier to prevent looting and other violence triggered by Floyd’s killing. New confirmed cases dropped by more than 5,000 cases over the past 15 days. Daily confirmed cases (May 10 – May 24): 13,706Daily confirmed cases (May 26 – June 9): 8,392New York stay-at-home order: Started March 22, onging.Cook County is home to Chicago, the country’s third most populous city. With 83,271 reported coronavirus cases, the county has one of the highest figures in the US. On June 7, Chicago’s mayor lifted the city’s 9pm curfew, which was put in place on June 1 as protests began to sweep the country. Confirmed cases, meanwhile, have dropped sharply from 19,355 cases (May 10 – May 24) to 8,392 (May 26 – June 9). Daily confirmed cases (May 10 – May 24): 19,355Daily confirmed cases (May 26 – June 9): 8,392Illinois stay-at-home order: Started March 12, ended May 30.Los Angeles is the US’s second most populated city. Los Angeles County – where the city resides – has registered a total of 65,945 confirmed cases since March. New coronavirus cases have increased over the past few weeks which experts have attributed to a slower shutdown and crowded living conditions, among other factors.Daily confirmed cases (May 11 – May 24): 13,314Daily confirmed cases (May 26 – June 9): 18,100California stay-at-home order: Started March 19, ongoing.Data for rest of the country (irrespective of where protests occurred) shows that out of the US’s 3,141 counties, 1,421 saw an increase, 1,198 a decrease and 522 had the same number of reported coronavirus cases since Memorial Day on May 25 compared to the 15 days before.  Anthony Fauci, the US’s top infectious disease expert, told Washington, DC radio station WTOP that “the reasons for demonstrating are valid, yet the demonstration itself puts one at an additional risk”.He advised protesters who plan on going out to wear a mask and keep it on at all times.Photos from the demonstrations showed many young people, of various races, wearing face masks while protesting (though masks were not worn by all). The CDC recommends that everyone wear cloth face coverings when leaving their homes, regardless of whether they exhibit any COVID-19 symptoms. The cloth face covering is not a substitute for physical distancing – which the CDC recommends to be at least two metres (six feet).  “The evidence suggests that although still significant, the risk of transmission of the virus in open spaces is much less than in indoor areas”, said Amir Khan, a doctor and senior lecturer at the University of Leeds and the University of Bradford in the United Kingdom.Khan added that “fresh air dilutes the virus to a degree that transmission is much less”. Furthermore, “there is also some evidence, albeit small, that direct exposure to sunlight kills the virus quickly”.Maia Lesosky, associate professor of epidemiology and biostatistics at the University of Cape Town, told Al Jazeera that “about 95 percent of people who experience symptoms get them within 14 days of infection, but in order see an increase in cases, we also need to account for the delay in getting tested and reported”. Furthermore, she notes, “being outdoors certainly reduces the risk of transmission, by 20- to 500-fold according to some estimates.” One of the stealthiest characteristics of the coronavirus is that it can be spread with little to no symptoms. This means that the number of people who are actually infected is probably much higher than the number of official confirmed cases.Elaborating further, Lesosky said, “in contrast, the crowding that often happens during mass marches, and especially the responses by the police including the use of tear gas, pepper spray [respiratory irritants] and the arrest and incarceration of large numbers of people are very likely to increase transmission.”Across the world, health officials will be closely monitoring the figures where large protests have taken place.  In many countries, authorities have banned demonstrations due to health concerns, but protesters showed up nonetheless. ",
    "Thousands of people have taken to the streets, demanding justice for George Floyd and an end to systemic racism.Thousands of people around the world have rallied in solidarity with anti-racism protests in the United States following the police killing of George Floyd on May 25.Floyd, an unarmed Black man, was pinned to the ground by a white officer in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The officer, who has since been fired and charged for murder, knelt on Floyd’s neck for nearly nine minutes, as Floyd pleaded “I can’t breathe”.Protests, which began in Minneapolis, have spread to hundreds of cities across the US. National Guard troops have been deployed in at least 23 states to handle the demonstrations.Outside the US, large protests have also erupted in many cities around the world.North America: Large crowds have gathered in cities across Canada and in Mexico’s capital, Mexico City. Protesters waved placards with the words “No justice! No peace!”, “I can’t breathe” and “Black lives matter”.South America: Big crowds took to the streets of Brazil’s second largest city Rio de Janerio and Argentina’s capital, Buenos Aires.Europe: The European Union said it was “shocked and appalled” by the death of Floyd, calling it “an abuse of power” and warned against further excessive use of force. Thousands protested across several European cities, including Berlin, London and Amsterdam, defying coronavirus bans.Africa: Sizable protests were held in Nigeria and Kenya. The African Union issued a strongly worded statement condemning the killing of Floyd. US embassies in Kenya, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Zimbabwe also issued statements of concern over Floyd’s death.Middle East: Hundreds gathered in Tel Aviv, Haifa and East Jerusalem demanding “Justice for George” and “Justice for Eyad” an unarmed, autistic Palestinian man killed by Israeli police.Asia-Pacific: Rallies were held in several cities across Australia and New Zealand.The map and list below show the locations where sizeable protests have occurred.

    "Thousands arrested across US cities including, Los Angeles and New York in the wake of anti-racism protests.Latest updates:Defense Secretary Mark Esper said during a news conference that he supported the rights of US citizens to protest peacefully and does not support the invocation of the Insurrection Act. “It is these rights and freedoms that make our country so special. It is these rights and freedoms that American service members are willing to fight and die for,” Esper said in remarks before taking questions.“I do not support invoking the Insurrection Act.”President Trump has threatened to use the act to use the military to quell protests across the country. The Insurrection Act dates to the early 1800s and permits the president to send in US forces to suppress a domestic insurrection that has hindered the normal enforcement of US law. Esper further said he was not informed about Trump’s controversial photo-op at a church which took place on Monday. “I was not aware of law enforcement’s plans for the park. I was not briefed on them, nor should I expect to be,” Esper said. The defence secretary further said he was working hard to keep his department out of politics, though it is challenging as the country moves closer to elections.Workers removed the statue of controversial former Philadelphia Mayor Frank Rizzo, which was recently defaced during a protest following George Floyd’s death.As National Guard troops deployed in the wake of recent protests watched, a crane lifted the 10-foot-tall (3 metres) bronze statue and workers moved it from its stand outside the Municipal Services Building, across from City Hall. It was loaded onto the back of a truck.Iran’s supreme leader has assailed Washington in the wake of George Floyd’s killing for its allegedly duplicitous policies when it comes to upholding human rights.Ayatollah Ali Khamenei claimed that in the US, “they kill people in an open crime, and they do not offer an apology while claiming [to support] human rights”.Khamenei, who has the final say on all state matters, added: “Apparently, the African American man who was killed there was not a human being.”The German government is shocked by the death of George Floyd at the hands of police and must work to counter racism at home like other countries, a government spokesman said on Wednesday.“The death of George Floyd … shocked people in Germany and all over the world, it shocked the federal government [of Germany] too,” spokesman Steffen Seibert said. “It is an appalling and avoidable death.”British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Wednesday Black lives mattered and he supported the right to protest, in a lawful and socially-distanced way, after the killing by police of George Floyd in the US stirred widespread anger.“Of course, Black lives matter and I totally understand the anger, the grief that is felt not just in America but around the world and in our country as well,” he told Parliament.“I also support, as I’ve said, the right to protest. The only point I would make … is that any protest should be carried out lawfully and in this country, protests should be carried out in accordance with our rules on social distancing.”Anti-racism and Black Lives Matter groups planned a rally in central London and a nationwide kneeling to protest against the death of African American man George Floyd in US police custody.  Black Lives Matter in London encouraged protesters to wear red at an afternoon rally in Hyde Park to “protest against the rights of Black people being abused globally”. Stand Up to Racism urged people across Britain to “take the knee on [their] doorstep and/or hold signs … to say JusticeForGeorgeFloyd BlackLivesMatter” at 6pm (17:00 GMT).Across the country at 6pm people will #TakeTheKnee +/ hold a sign on their doorstep to say #BlackLivesMatterThe millions who stand against racism will be heard.#JusticeForGeorgeFloyd#ICantBreathe— Jeremy Corbyn (@jeremycorbyn) June 3, 2020Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu called for clear-headedness amid protests over the killing of George Floyd.“It is unacceptable for police to kill any person in such a way, regardless of race or religion,” he added.“Justice must be done in a way that will relieve everyone’s conscience regarding the police who committed this murder,” he added.However, Cavusoglu stressed that protests turning into vandalism would be both inappropriate and dangerous.“No matter who it is, we do not support such vandalism, not just in the US but also in other countries,” he noted.Nationwide protests against police brutality in the US have seen thousands of people demonstrating in close quarters, chanting, shouting, and coughing when hit by tear gas, something that has raised concerns over the spread of the coronavirus.Experts say racialised police violence is a grave and neglected public health crisis for African Americans, threatening not just their lives but increasing their risk of developing stress-related diseases, from heart failure to cancer.Read more here.US musician Jay-Z, along with lawyers, activists and victims of police violence, has taken out full-page advertisements in newspapers across the United States in memory of George Floyd, an African-American man who died in police custody.The ad, which was posted on the Instagram account of Jay-Z’s philanthropic project Roc Nation, is captioned “In dedication to George Floyd.” It features an excerpt from a speech by the Black civil rights activist Martin Luther King in 1965.

US media reported that there were fewer acts of looting and violent confrontations than previous nights.In a Twitter post, Mayor Bill de Blasio said the curfew “is certainly helping”.At Barclays Center now. Very calm situation. So far, the curfew is certainly helping, based on everything I’ve seen in Brooklyn and Manhattan over the last three hours.— Mayor Bill de Blasio (@NYCMayor) June 3, 2020Police in Portland, Oregon, deployed pepper spray, tear gas flash bangs to disperse crowds, according to local media, after a group of protesters in the city’s downtown area were throwing “projectiles at officers, including bottles, mortars, bats, fireworks”.Due to the criminal activity and unlawful assembly, everyone should leave the downtown core area immediately.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 3, 2020Antonio Guterres, the secretary-general of the United Nations, called on authorities in the US to “show restraint in responding to demonstrations”.In a Twitter post, he said: “I am heartbroken to see violence on the streets in our host country and host city of New York.” In every society, diversity is a richness – never a threat.Racism is an abhorrence that we must all reject.— António Guterres (@antonioguterres) June 2, 2020Reverend Gini Gerbasi, the rector at St John’s Episcopal Church of Georgetown, was at the scene when police began to clear protesters outside the historic Episcopal church near the White House for a Trump photo-op.“I was completely stunned,” she told CNN.“I never would imagine that I would look up and see an entire line of police officers all in this heavy military gear, all black and these shields, literally, pushing and shoving and driving people off of the church patio. I looked up and there they were,” she added.“I was helping wipe away tears in people’s eyes … and suddenly the police were pushing us back.Thousands of demonstrators protesting the death of Floyd remained on New York City streets after an 8pm (00:00 GMT) curfew.Mayor Bill de Blasio had doubled down on a citywide curfew, moving it up from 11pm (03:00 GMT) a night earlier, but rejected urging from Trump and an offer from Governor Andrew Cuomo to bring in the National Guard.NYC, CALL UP THE NATIONAL GUARD. The lowlifes and losers are ripping you apart. Act fast! Don’t make the same horrible and deadly mistake you made with the Nursing Homes!!!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 2, 2020People marched in groups of thousands in parts of Manhattan and Brooklyn, as merchants boarded up their businesses. As the curfew time arrived, many were still in the streets and continued marching, with officers initially standing by and allowing them.But officers started ordering people to move along, and began taking people into custody. Demonstrators who had been on the West Side Highway in lower Manhattan were herded off, with parts of the roadway blocked off behind them.The majority of Americans sympathise with nationwide protests over Floyd’s, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll.The survey conducted on Monday and Tuesday found that 64 percent of American adults were “sympathetic to people who are out protesting right now,” while 27 percent said they were not and 9 percent were unsure.The poll also underscored the political risks for Trump, who has adopted a hardline approach to the protests and threatened to deploy the US military to quell violent dissent – he faces reelection in November.More than 55 percent of respondents said they disapproved of Trump’s handling of the protests, including 40 percent who “strongly” disapproved, while just one-third said they approved – lower than his overall job approval of 39 percent the poll showed.The protest in Washington, DC, lacked the tension of the previous nights’ demonstrations. The crowd in Lafayette Park near the White House was quiet.Instead of the spray-painted tags, the protesters went for colourful children’s street chalk, writing Black Lives Matter slogans on the asphalt in front of St John’s Church.Protesters chanted and talked among themselves, most wearing masks, but not social distancing. The crowd started thinning out after a curfew went into place, although a core group of several hundred remained at the fence, chanting at the line of police and soldiers in riot gear on the other side.Former President George W Bush said in a statement that he and wife Laura Bush “are anguished by the brutal suffocation of George Floyd and disturbed by the injustice and fear that suffocate our country.”Bush did not specifically mention Trump, but he called the harassment and threats toward African American protesters “a shocking failure”.“It is a strength when protesters, protected by responsible law enforcement, march for a better future… Those who set out to silence those voices do not understand the meaning of America – or how it becomes a better place,” he said.Floyd’s hometown of Houston, Texas, held a memorial march to honour him, attended by some 60,000 people, the mayor’s office said. Floyd lived most of his 46 years in Houston’s historically Black Third Ward neighbourhood, located about a mile (1.6km) south of the park where the march began.Acting Chief of the United States Park Police (USPP) Gregory Monahan said security forces did not use tear gas against protesters near the White House on Monday, as has been widely reported by US and international media.He also challenged the reported claim that the protest had been peaceful.Moments before Trump was set to speak on Monday, law enforcement suddenly marched forward, directly confronting hundreds of protesters who had gathered to protest against the death of George Floyd. Many held up their hands, saying, “Don’t shoot.”Washington, D.C., was the safest place on earth last night!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 2, 2020Soon, in images seen on live television, law enforcement officers were seen forcing the protesters back, deploying flashbangs and other riot dispersal weapons into the crowd.After addressing reporters, Trump then made an unexpected walk from his residence, across Lafayette Park and to the historic St John’s Episcopal Church, that was damaged during unrest the night before.He paused for an apparent photo-op, posing with members of his administration, and holding up a Bible.In the statement Monahan denied that the protest was peaceful saying, saying “violent protesters” began “throwing projectiles including bricks, frozen water bottles and caustic liquids”.“Intelligence had revealed calls for violence against the police, and officers found caches of glass bottles, baseball bats and metal poles hidden along the street,” Monahan said.U.S. Park Police confirms that “no tear gas was used by USPP officers or other assisting law enforcement partners” in Lafayette Park.On what did the media base its sensationalized reporting that tear gas was used?How were media reporting it as fact?https://t.co/VuRmgfH3gU— Tim Murtaugh – Download the Trump 2020 app today! (@TimMurtaugh) June 2, 2020He said smoke canisters and pepper balls were used, but denied the use of tear gas.Pepper balls and tear gas have largely the same effect. They both are aimed at irritating an individual’s eyes.According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), various riot control agents, including pepper spray, are often referred to as “tear gas”.Monahan made no mention of Trump’s walk to the church. Earlier on Monday, US media reported that Attorney General William Barr ordered the area be cleared just before the Trump spoke in the White House Rose GardenRead more here.In an emotional plea, the mother of Floyd’s daughter demanded justice for him, saying he was a good father who did not deserve to die face down on the pavement, pinned under the weight of three police officers.With her six-year-old daughter Gianna clinging to her, Roxie Washington told reporters she wants all four officers involved in Floyd’s death to be held accountable for his death.“At the end of the day, they get to go home and be with their families,” Washington said. “Gianna doesn’t have a father. He will never see her grow up, graduate. He will never walk her down the aisle.”Gianna clung to her mother, at times with a frown on her face.“He loved her, he loved her so much,” Washington said of Floyd’s feelings for their daughter. “I’m here for my baby. I’m here for George because I want justice for him, and I want justice for him because he was good. No matter what anybody thinks, he was good.”Read more here.US Senate Republicans blocked a Democratic resolution that would have condemned Trump for the use of gas and rubber bullets against peaceful protesters near the White House.On Monday, federal officials cleared protesters near the White House just before Trump marched through to pose holding a Bible outside a boarded-up church. That, and Trump’s threat to deploy federal troops to quell unrest, has deepened outrage among protesters.Indianapolis’ mayor extended an overnight curfew into a third night.Mayor Joe Hogsett’s office said officers would continue to use an “education first” approach before arresting people who violate the curfew, which will run from 9 pm Tuesday until 6 am Wednesday.During the curfew, residents cannot travel on public streets or be out in public unless they are traveling directly to or from work, their jobs involve travel, are seeking medical care or are fleeing danger.Citing Floyd’s death, New Jersey Attorney General Gurbir Grewal said the state will update its guidelines governing the use of force by police for the first time in two decades and will move to require a statewide licensing program for all officers.“To the thousands of New Jerseyans that assembled peacefully this week let me be clear: we hear you, we see you, we respect you, we share your anger and we share your commitment to change,” Grewal said during a news conference.Texas Governor Greg Abbott said his state would not request military support after President Donald Trump threatened to deploy troops across the US to confront protesters.Abbott also said he was not asked to send Texas National Guard members to the District of Columbia after days of violent demonstrations there led to fires, destroyed businesses and the use tear gas and flash bangs, including on peaceful protesters. US Attorney General William Barr personally asked for protesters to be pushed back from Washington’s Lafayette Square the Washington Post reported, just before Trump spoke from the White House Rose Garden.Following a brief speech on Monday, Trump walked out of the White House, with a heavy security detail, across Lafayette Square to St. John’s Episcopal Church, where he stopped in front of boarded-up windows and held up a Bible for cameras before walking back to the White House.The Washington Post reported that Barr made the request about pushing back protesters from the square after finding a previous decision to widen the security perimeter around the White House had not been acted upon.Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg told employees that he stood by his decision not to challenge inflammatory posts by Trump, refusing to give ground.A group of Facebook employees – nearly all of them working at home due to the coronavirus pandemic – walked off the job on Monday.They complained the company should have acted against Trump’s posts about protests containing the phrase “when the looting starts, the shooting starts.”Zuckerberg told employees Facebook had conducted a thorough review and was right to leave the posts unchallenged, a company spokeswoman said. She said Zuckerberg also acknowledged the decision had upset many people working at the company.Read more here.The state of Minnesota filed a human rights complaint against the Minneapolis Police Department in the death of George Floyd.Governor Tim Walz and the Minnesota Department of Human Rights announced the filing at a news conference.The department enforces the state’s human rights act, particularly as it applies to discrimination in employment, housing, education, public accommodations and public services. Mediation is one of its first-choice tools, but the cases it files can lead to fuller investigations and sometimes end up in litigation.The investigation will examine the” department’s policies, procedures, and practices over the past 10 years to determine if they engaged in systemic discriminatory practices,” Walz says. The Minneapolis Police Department has faced decades of allegations brutality and other discrimination against African Americans and other minorities, even within the department itself. Critics say its culture resists change, despite the elevation of Medaria Arradondo as its first black police chief in 2017.Arradondo himself was among five black officers who sued the police department in 2007 over alleged discrimination in promotions, pay, and discipline. They said in their lawsuit that the department had a history of tolerating racism and discrimination. The city eventually settled the lawsuit for $740,000.Ohio’s Republican senator said Tuesday the US military shouldn’t be sent into his home state.“That should be a local decision,” said Rob Portman, who lives in the Cincinnati area. “It should be what the mayors and governors want … I don’t see that happening right now. … The National Guard certainly in Ohio is capable of handling the situation.”Trump is vowing to send the military into states to quell protests over the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody if state authorities don’t restore order.Questioned sharply by Ohio reporters about the president’s recent actions and rhetoric, Portman said he agrees with Trump on such positions as expediting the federal probe of the latest death of a black person in police custody and on the need to stop violence.“But I do believe he can and should do more … you know, words matter. And we need to be sure we’re not inflaming this situation,” Portman said. “This is a time for healing, it’s a time to calm things down so we can have a dialogue. And I think that’s what’s needed right now.”US House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Tuesday promised legislation on racial profiling and other issues raised by the police killing of George Floyd, while other lawmakers warned against using troops to quell protests sweeping across the United States.House Democrats are mulling proposals on a number of topics. But Pelosi described the racial profiling of suspects as a “universal” issue “that we must be rid of.”“In a matter of just a short time … decisions will be made and I think the American people will be well served,” she said.Pelosi and other Democrats attacked President Donald Trump’s handling of protests after tear gas and rubber bullets were used to clear peaceful protesters from outside the White House, just before he marched through the area and posed at a church with a Bible.In his first major address in weeks, former Vice President Joe Biden on Tuesday promised not to “fan the flames of hate” if elected president and instead seek “to heal the racial wounds that have long plagued” the United States.Biden, a Democrat who will most likely face the Republican Trump in the November 3 election, was particularly critical of the president’s decision on Monday to stand for a photo beside an historic church across from the White House after law enforcement authorities tear-gassed protesters to clear the area.“When peaceful protesters are dispersed by the order of the president from the doorstep of the people’s house, the White House – using tear gas and flash grenades – in order to stage a photo op at a noble church, we can be forgiven for believing that the president is more interested in power than in principle,” Biden said.Read more here. The lawyers for Floyd’s family have released the details for the public memorials and funeral for FloydMinneapolis, Minnesota, Memorial:  Date: Thursday, June 4  Time: 1pm (18:00 GMT)  Raeford, North Carolina, Public Viewing and Memorial:  Date: Saturday, June 6  Time: Public viewing 11am-1pm (15:00-17:00 GMT)  Memorial 3pm (19:00 GMT)Houston, Texas, Public Viewing:  Date: Monday, June 8  Time: 12 – 6pm CT (17:00 GMT-23:00 GMT)  Houston, Texas, Memorial:  Date: Tuesday, June 9  Time: 11am (16:00 GMT)Please pray for the family as they prepare for #GeorgeFloyd's homegoing services.

We’re going to beat it back,” Mayor Bill de Blasio said at a news conference Tuesday as he announced that an 8pm-to-5am curfew would hold through Sunday.The plan came after a night when chaos broke out in midtown Manhattan and the Bronx.On Monday, an 11pm curfew – the city’s first in decades – failed to prevent destruction as groups of people smashed their way into shops, including Macy’s flagship Manhattan store.Police said nearly 700 people were arrested and several officers were injured during the chaos Monday night and early Tuesday.Virginia Governor Ralph Northam rejected a request from Secretary of Defense Mark Esper to send between 3,000 to 5,000 of the state’s national guard to Washington, DC, as part of a massive show of force organised by the Trump administration in response to violent protests, according to Northam’s chief of staff, Clark Mercer.Mercer said Trump’s comments to governors in a phone call Monday, in which the president said most governors were “weak” and needed to “dominate” the streets, played a role in the decision.“The president’s remarks to the governors heightened our concerns about how the guard would be used,” he said.Faith leaders in Washington, DC, have continued to express outrage over Trump’s photo-op at the historic St John’s Episcopal Church.“I am outraged. The president did not pray when he came to St John’s, nor as you just articulated, did he acknowledge the agony of our country right now,” Bishop Mariann Edgar Budde told CNN.Wilton Gregory, the Archbishop of Washington, meanwhile decried Trump’s planned visit to Saint John Paul II National Shrine on Tuesday.“I find it baffling and reprehensible that any Catholic facility would allow itself to be so egregiously misused and manipulated in a fashion that violates our religious principles, which call us to defend the rights of all people even those with whom we might disagree,” Gregory, the first African American Catholic Archbishop of Washington, said in a statement..@WashArchbishop Gregory has released a statement on the president's visit to the Saint John Paul II National Shrine.https://t.co/46g9Ac8Wy5 pic.twitter.com/d1wERIoLVp— DC Archdiocese (@WashArchdiocese) June 2, 2020“Saint Pope John Paul II was an ardent defender of the rights and dignity of human beings,” he added “His legacy bears vivid witness to that truth. He certainly would not condone the use of tear gas and other deterrents to silence.”The music industry is turning off the music on Tuesday and suspending business as usual to reflect and implement change in response to the death of George Floyd and the killings of other Black people.Several top record labels organised Black Out Tuesday as violent protests erupted around the world, sparked by Floyd’s death as well as the killings of Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor. MTV and BET went dark for eight minutes and 46 seconds (the amount of time a white police officer knelt on Floyd’s neck before he died) in support of Black Lives Matter and racial injustice. Music-based companies Live Nation, as well as the Recording Academy, posted to social media that they planned to support and stand with the Black community.Read more here.Minnesota’s attorney general says prosecutors are working as fast as they can to determine whether more charges will be filed against officers involved in the death of George Floyd, but they also have to work carefully and methodically.Attorney General Keith Ellison was appointed lead prosecutor in the case Sunday. He told the television news programme Good Morning America on Tuesday that those who have culpability will be held accountable.Ellison says despite the widely viewed bystander video of Floyd’s final moments, cases against police are hard. He pointed to the deaths of Freddie Gray and Philando Castile, and the beating of Rodney King, as examples of cases where striking video of an incident did not lead to convictions of officers.Ellison did not give a timeline for any new charges. All four officers have been fired.Kansas Governor Laura Kelly says that bringing the military “into this contentious moment” would do more harm than good.Kelly on Monday expressed sympathy for George Floyd’s family, families of other people killed by police and people outraged by Floyd’s “tragic murder”. She promised to work to address systemic racism.“We need our leaders – myself included – to listen to those who felt their only means of being heard was to take to the street in protest,” Kelly said after President Donald Trump threatened to deploy the military to states if they did not stamp out violent protests.“We need action to change the systemic inequalities we have ignored for far too long. We need to stop with the divisive language and instead, come together and do what’s right for our state,” Kelly added.She noted that Kansas protests have been peaceful and promised to work closely with local officials to ensure public safety.Mayor Muriel Bowser, the Democratic mayor of Washington, DC, meanwhile, said on CNN on Tuesday that it is inappropriate for the military to be used for police work on DC streets.“We don’t think that the active-duty military should be used on American streets against Americans,” she said.“It’s an inappropriate use of our military. And we have police in Washington, DC. We have federal police in Washington, DC, to focus on the federal properties, and that is an appropriate use. Police have policing power, and bringing in the military to do police work is inappropriate in any state in the United States of America without the consent of the governor, and it would be inappropriate in Washington, DC.”Trump has threatened to deploy the military if states don’t take harsher measures to quell unrest.The streets around the White House complex were shut Tuesday morning, guarded by a mix of Secret Service officers and FBI agents.Overnight, a fence was constructed around Lafayette Park and along 17th Street at Pennsylvania Avenue, two areas that have been focal points for protests. A man in Washington, DC said he sheltered about 70 protesters in his home all night after they got caught between police lines after curfew.Rahul Dubey told WJLA-TV he was sitting on his porch around 8:30pm last night when law enforcement officers began corralling protesters on his street. He let some sit with him, and helped others out through his back alley, but the situation then escalated when officers started pushing protesters to the ground and releasing pepper spray, creating a “human tsunami” that flooded into his home.“I was hanging on my railing yelling, ‘Get in the house! Get in the house!'” he told The Washington Post.Officers also released pepper spray through the window after he closed the door, Dubey told WJLA-TV. The protesters inside the home screamed, and started pouring water and milk into their eyes, which were reddened by tear gas, in a scene he described as “pure mayhem”.The protesters left the home after 6am Tuesday when the district’s curfew ended.Police in St Louis say officers in a marked police car were fired on early Tuesday from a car occupied by suspected looters.The incident led to a chase that ended in the suburb of Jennings, where one of the suspects was shot. Police said the incident was separate from a shooting around midnight Monday in which four St Louis officers were shot and injured.The Jennings shooting began when officers in a marked police car on the north side of St Louis – who were searching for looting suspects – were fired on from men inside a car, police said. That led to a chase that ended in Jennings, just north of St. Louis, when the three suspects bailed out of the car, and one was shot by a St Louis County officer, police said.One man, identified only as 21 years old, was taken to a hospital with life-threatening injuries. Police said another man who had been in the car was arrested, and a third escaped.No officers were injured in the Jennings shooting.____________________________________________________________________Hello and welcome to Al Jazeera’s continuing coverage of the protests in the US over the deadly arrest of George Floyd in Minneapolis, Minnesota. This is Laurin-Whitney Gottbrath in Louisville, Kentucky.Here are a few things to catch up on:See the updates from Sunday’s protests here.",
    "In a separate ruling, judge said he would allow jury to hear limited evidence from George Floyd’s 2019 arrestA judge on Friday denied a defense request to delay or move the trial of a former Minneapolis police officer charged in George Floyd’s death, following the announcement a week ago of a record $27m settlement between the city and Floyd’s family, which raised concern about the prospect of a tainted jury.George Floyd was killed in the city last May when Derek Chauvin kneeled on his neck in the street during an attempted arrest. Chauvin was fired and is now standing trial for murder, with opening arguments expected before the end of the month.Three other former officers will stand trial in August, together, charged with aiding and abetting. Chauvin also faces federal civil rights charges.In a separate ruling in the current case, the Hennepin county judge Peter Cahill said he would allow the jury in Chauvin’s trial to hear limited evidence from an earlier arrest of Floyd in 2019 – but only the evidence pertaining to the cause of Floyd’s death in 2020.Cahill acknowledged there are several similarities between the two incidents, including that Floyd swallowed controlled drugs after police confronted him.The rulings were a blow to Chauvin’s defense. His attorney, Eric Nelson, had sought to halt or move the trial due to concerns that the settlement announcement had tainted the jury pool.Jury selection was halfway complete last week when the city of Minneapolis unanimously approved the payout to settle a civil lawsuit over Floyd’s death.Nelson called the timing of the settlement deeply disturbing and unfair, and said it jeopardized Chauvin’s chance for a fair trial. Chauvin is charged with murder and manslaughter.But Cahill, who has called the timing “unfortunate”, said he thought a delay would do nothing to stem the problem of pre-trial publicity.As for moving the trial, he said there was no place in Minnesota that had not been touched by that publicity.The killing of Floyd last year, which a bystander recorded on video, sparked the biggest civil rights uprising in the US since the 1960s, spilling over at times into rioting but reinvigorating the Black Lives Matter movement and forcing a fresh reckoning on police brutality and broader, systemic racism.The judge had previously denied a defense attempt to allow evidence of the year-old arrest at trial.But he heard fresh arguments this week because of drugs found in January in a second search of the police SUV in which the four officers attempted to put Floyd in 2020.He said on Thursday that he would allow medical evidence of Floyd’s physical reactions, such as his dangerously high blood pressure when he was examined by a paramedic, and a short clip of an officer’s body camera video.He said Floyd’s “emotional behavior” such as calling out to his mother in 2019 will not be admitted.Nelson argued that similarities between the encounters are relevant, with Floyd calling out for his mother, claiming he had been shot before, crying and putting what appeared to be pills in his mouth.Prosecutor Matthew Frank said the defense was simply looking for a backdoor way to portray Floyd as a bad person, and the only relevant issue in Floyd’s death is how he was treated by police.Floyd, who was Black, was declared dead on 25 May after Chauvin, who is white, pressed his knee on Floyd’s neck for about nine minutes while he was handcuffed and pleading that he couldn’t breathe.The 12 jurors seated through Thursday are evenly split by race, with six white jurors, four Black and two multiracial, according to the court. Two more jurors are to be selected as alternates.",
    "Concerns appear to fade that settlement will derail trial of ex-officer as two jurors seatedConcern appears to be fading that a massive settlement for George Floyd’s family will derail the trial of a former police officer accused in his death, with most potential jurors saying they avoided news of the settlement or could set it aside.Two jurors seated before news of the city’s $27m settlement broke last week were dismissed on Wednesday after being re-questioned by Hennepin county judge Peter Cahill, but five others were retained and two were added later in the day.Both sides presented arguments on Thursday about whether the prosecution can call a forensic psychiatrist to tell the jury about Floyd’s behavior during the fatal encounter. Prosecutor Jerry Blackwell said Dr Sarah Vinson, of Atlanta, should be allowed to testify how Floyd’s reactions to the officers’ attempts to put him into the squad car were consistent with any reasonable person’s anxiety or panic during a traumatic event. Police officers who confronted Floyd after he allegedly tried to pass a counterfeit $20 bill at a convenience store put a gun in his face, and he told police he had claustrophobia.The prosecution wants to show that he might have been unable to comply with the officers’ orders, rather than resisting arrest. But defense attorney Eric Nelson argued that if the prosecution gets to present that evidence to the jury, the defense should be able to tell the jury about Floyd’s drug arrest a year earlier, when he did not resist getting put into a squad car.Nelson also has said there are striking similarities between the two encounters that could show a pattern of behavior from Floyd: both times, as officers drew their guns and struggled with Floyd, he called out for his mother, claimed he had been shot before and cried, and put what appeared to be pills in his mouth. Drugs were found in the first arrest, and an autopsy showed Floyd had drugs in his system when he died. Cahill said he will rule on Vinson’s testimony on Friday, when he plans to issue a broader ruling on the admissibility of Floyd’s 2019 arrest and on defense motions for delaying or moving the trial.Nine jurors have been selected through Wednesday. Five are men and four are women. According to the court, four are white, two are multiracial and three are Black, and their ages range from 20s to 50s.Fourteen jurors, including two alternates, are needed for Chauvin’s trial on murder and manslaughter charges in Floyd’s death.A woman who was questioned early on Thursday was excused after she said she had been constantly exposed to news of Floyd’s death and that the announcement of the city’s settlement pushed her to favor the state’s position, which she was already leaning toward.Cahill has set 29 March for opening statements if the jury is complete by then.Chauvin is charged with murder and manslaughter in the 25 May death of Floyd, a Black man who was declared dead after Chauvin, who is white, pressed his knee against his neck for about nine minutes. Floyd’s death, captured on bystander video, set off weeks of sometimes violent protests across the country and led to a national reckoning on racial justice.Three other former officers face an August trial in Floyd’s death on charges of aiding and abetting second-degree murder and manslaughter.

    "Jurors dismissed after judge concerned they been tainted by city’s settlement with Floyd’s familyA judge on Wednesday dismissed two jurors who had been seated for the trial of a former Minneapolis police officer accused in George Floyd’s death over concerns they had been tainted by the city’s announcement of a $27m settlement with Floyd’s family.Hennepin county judge Peter Cahill recalled seven jurors who were seated before the settlement announcement last week, and questioned each about what they knew of the settlement and whether it would affect their ability to serve. Former officer Derek Chauvin’s attorney, Eric Nelson, had requested the recall.That five of the seven jurors said they were able to shut out the news or set it aside was a fairly good outcome for those who hope the trial will stay on course, and may reduce the chance of Cahill agreeing to a defense request to delay the trial.Chauvin is charged with murder and manslaughter in the 25 May death of Floyd, a Black man who was declared dead after Chauvin, who is white, pressed his knee against his neck for about nine minutes. Floyd’s death, captured on a widely seen bystander video, set off weeks of sometimes violent protests across the country and led to a national reckoning on racial justice.Cahill was careful to ask jurors if they had heard the news of the settlement without giving details, saying only that there had been “extensive media coverage about developments in a civil suit between the city of Minneapolis and the family of George Floyd” and asking if they were exposed to it.The first dismissed juror, a white man in his 30s, said he had heard about the settlement. “I think it will be hard to be impartial,” he said.“That sticker price obviously shocked me,” the second juror dismissed said. The Hispanic man in his 20s said he thought he could set the news aside, but wasn’t sure, and after a long pause, Cahill dismissed him.Cahill retained five other jurors, including a Black man in his 30s who told Cahill he heard about the settlement on the radio Friday evening but could put it aside and decide the case only on evidence presented in the courtroom.“It hasn’t affected me at all because I don’t know the details,” he said.Jury selection through Tuesday had been proceeding faster than expected. Cahill has set opening statements for 29 March at the earliest, but dismissal of some of the previously seated jurors could imperil that timeline. Nine people had been selected for the jury, including seven before Friday’s settlement was announced.Nelson called the timing of the announcement by city leaders in the middle of jury selection “profoundly disturbing“ and “not fair”. He also requested a delay in the trial, which Cahill is considering.Seven jurors remain, including four men and three women. Four are white, one is multiracial and two are Black, and their ages range from 20s to 50s. Fourteen people, including two alternates, are needed.On Tuesday, the two sides skirmished over whether evidence of Floyd’s 2019 arrest in Minneapolis should be allowed at trial.The judge previously rejected Chauvin’s attempt to tell the jury about the arrest – a year before his fatal encounter with Chauvin – but heard fresh arguments Tuesday from both sides. He said he would rule on the request Friday.Nelson argued that new evidence makes the earlier arrest admissible: Drugs were found in December 2019 during a second search of the car Floyd was in, and were found in a January 2020 search of the squad car into which the four officers attempted to put Floyd.He also argued the similarities between the encounters are relevant: Both times, as officers drew their guns and struggled to get Floyd out of the car, he called out for his mother, claimed he had been shot before and cried, and put what appeared to be pills in his mouth. Officers noticed a white residue outside his mouth both times, although that has not been explained.In the first arrest, several opioid pills and cocaine were found. An autopsy showed Floyd had fentanyl and methamphetamine in his system when he died.Paramedics who examined Floyd in 2019 warned him that his blood pressure was dangerously high, putting him at risk for a heart attack or stroke, and took him to a hospital for examination. Nelson argued that shows Floyd knew that swallowing drugs could land him in the hospital rather than jail.But prosecutor Matthew Frank argued the only relevant thing in Floyd’s death is how he was handled by Chauvin and the other officers.“What these officers were dealing with is what they were responsible for,” Frank said. “What is relevant to this case is what they knew at the scene at this time.”Cahill said he would stop the defense “very quickly” from suggesting at trial that Floyd didn’t deserve sympathy because he used drugs.“You don’t just dirty up someone who has died in these circumstances as a defense,” he said.",
    "City agrees to settle lawsuit with family during jury selection for trial of Derek Chauvin, former police officer charged with murderThe city of Minneapolis has agreed to pay $27m to settle a civil lawsuit with the family of George Floyd, even as jury selection was under way in the murder trial of the former police of the former police officer, Derek Chauvin, who killed him.The city council unanimously approved the settlement on Friday. The council emerged from closed session to announce the move, which includes $500,000 for the neighborhood where Floyd was arrested.The Floyd family attorney, Ben Crump, said in a prepared statement that it was the largest pre-trial civil rights settlement ever in a wrongful death lawsuit, and “sends a powerful message that Black lives do matter and police brutality against people of color must end”.Floyd, who was Black, was declared dead on 25 May 2020 after Derek Chauvin, a former police officer who is white, pressed his knee against his neck for almost nine minutes. Floyd’s death sparked mass protests in Minneapolis and across the US and led to a national reckoning on racial justice.“I hope that today will center the voices of the family and anything that they would like to share,” the council president, Lisa Bender, said. “But I do want to, on behalf of the entire city council, offer my deepest condolences to the family of George Floyd, his friends and all of our community who are mourning his loss.”Floyd’s sister, Bridgett Floyd, said in a statement: “On behalf of all of my family members, I am pleased that this part of our tragic journey to justice for my brother George is resolved.”She added: “Our family suffered an irreplaceable loss May 25 when George’s life was senselessly taken by a Minneapolis police officer. While we will never get our beloved George back, we will continue to work tirelessly to make this world a better, and safer, place for all.”Floyd’s family filed the federal civil rights lawsuit in July against the city, Chauvin and three other fired officers charged in his death. It alleged the officers violated Floyd’s rights when they restrained him, and that the city allowed a culture of excessive force, racism and impunity to flourish in its police force.George Floyd’s brother, Philonise Floyd, said of the settlement: “Even though my brother is not here, he’s here with me in my heart. If I could get him back, I would give all this back.”“That dollar amount shows that what happened to George Floyd was wrong. It goes to show that we matter but it’s an opportunity to show that these types of injustices are wrong. It was a clear violation of George Floyd’s civil rights. It shouldn’t have happened,” said Todd Gramenz of Black Lives Matter St Paul.Black Lives Matter Saint Paul was established in 2014 after Michael Brown was killed in Ferguson. They have been organizing protests and lobbying since then.Gramenz added that you cannot really put a dollar value on a life. “How do you value a Black man, who’s innocent, that’s killed?” he said, and called for more police who kill to stand trial.Only one Minnesota police officer has been convicted a murder before, a Black officer who killed a white women, yet several hundred Minnesotans have suffered police-involved deaths in the last 20 years.It was not immediately clear how the settlement might affect the trial or the jury now being seated to hear it. Joseph Daly, a professor emeritus at Mitchell Hamline School of Law, said it will be hard to stop jurors or potential jurors from hearing about it.“Judge Cahill will likely explain to the jurors that each must make a decision based solely on the evidence they hear in the criminal trial,” Daly said.Any praise for the settlement overlooks “how many families that have failed to get a settlement and how they have failed to hold police accountable”, DJ Hooker from the Twin Cities Coalition for Justice 4 Jamar campaign group told the Guardian.He added: “It’s good that we see that this happened with the $27m but on top of that, we need to make sure that happens for all families affected by police brutality. Everyone doesn’t get the same amount. It’s not fair. Everyone needs to be able to get money when their loved ones die.”However, Hooker said holding police officers accountable and protecting the community by preventing brutality and violence was vital.L Chris Stewart, an attorney who worked with Floyd’s family, said the size of the settlement “changes evaluations and civil rights for a Black person when they die”.“And what happens is that trickles down to decisions in the communities across this country. When there is a city council or a mayor deciding, ‘Oh, should we get rid of no-knock warrants, should we get rid of chokeholds, do we want to change these policies?’ They have 27m reasons now why they should,” he said.Meanwhile, with jury selection in its fourth day, seven people have been seated so far, with the jury roughly balanced between white people and people of color, according to the authorities.Opening statements are expected around 29 March.",
    "Reinstated count against ex-officer who kneeled on George Floyd’s neck gives jury another means of finding him guilty of murder, experts sayA judge has granted prosecutors’ request to add a third-degree murder count against a former Minneapolis police officer charged in George Floyd’s death, offering jurors an additional option for conviction and resolving an issue that might have delayed his trial for months.The Hennepin county judge Peter Cahill reinstated the charge on Thursday after the former officer, Derek Chauvin, failed to get appellate courts to block it. Cahill had earlier rejected the charge as not warranted by the circumstances of Floyd’s death, but an appellate court ruling in an unrelated case established new grounds.Chauvin already faced second-degree murder and manslaughter charges. Legal experts say the additional charge helps prosecutors by giving jurors another option to find Chauvin guilty of murder. Cahill told potential jurors after the ruling that he still expected opening statements on 29 March.The dispute over the third-degree murder charge revolved around wording in the law that references an act “eminently dangerous to others”. Cahill’s initial decision to dismiss the charge noted that Chauvin’s conduct might be construed as not dangerous to anyone but Floyd.But prosecutors sought to revive the charge after the state’s court of appeals recently upheld the third-degree murder conviction of another former Minneapolis police officer in the 2017 killing of an Australian woman. They argued that the ruling established precedent that the charge could be brought even in a case where only a single person is endangered.Arguments over when the precedent from the former officer Mohamed Noor’s case took effect went swiftly to the state’s supreme court, which on Wednesday said it would not consider Chauvin’s appeal. Cahill said Thursday that he accepts that precedent has been clearly established.“I feel bound by that and I feel it would be an abuse of discretion not to grant the motion,” he said.Floyd was declared dead on 25 May after Chauvin, who is white, pressed his knee against Floyd’s neck for about nine minutes. The death of Floyd, who was Black, sparked sometimes violent protests in Minneapolis and across the US, leading to a nationwide reckoning on race.Jury selection resumed Thursday for the third day as attorneys grappled further with the challenges of seating an impartial and diverse jury in such a high-profile case. By day’s end, the jury included five men and one woman. Cahill said three were white, one was multiracial, one was Hispanic and one was Black.The sole juror picked on Thursday described himself as an outgoing, family-oriented soccer fan for whom the prospect of the trial was “kind of exciting”.The man said he was also a fan of true crime podcasts and TV shows. He acknowledged under questioning from the defense attorney Eric Nelson that he had a “very negative” impression of Chauvin. The man wrote on his questionnaire that he had seen the widely viewed bystander video of Floyd “desperately screaming that he couldn’t breathe” even as other officers stood by and bystanders shouted that Chauvin was killing Floyd.Yet asked whether he could set his opinions aside and stick to the evidence presented in court, he replied: “I’m willing to see all the evidence and everything, hear witnesses.”Several other candidates were dismissed, including a woman who said she “can’t unsee the video” of Chauvin pinning Floyd, and a man who said he had doubts about Black Lives Matter and the way the group pursues its goals.Nelson challenged the woman on her ability to be fair despite her strong opinions.Asked how the events of last summer had affected the community, she replied: “Negatively affected because a life was taken. Positively because a movement has come from it and the whole world knows.” Asked about the property damage during the unrest, she said: “I felt that was what needed to happen to bring this to the world’s attention.”“Looking in your heart and looking in your mind, can you assure us you can set all of that aside, all of that, and focus only on the evidence that is presented in this courtroom?” Nelson asked.“I can assure you, but like you mentioned earlier, the video is going to be a big part of the evidence and there’s no changing my mind about that,” she replied.Cahill dismissed her for cause, sparing Nelson from having to use one of his peremptory strikes. The prosecutor Steve Schleicher objected, saying she might have been subjected to harder questioning than other potential jurors.At least three weeks have been set aside to complete a jury of 12 plus two alternates. Potential jurors’ identities are being protected and they are not shown on livestreamed video of the proceedings.Chauvin and three other officers were fired. The others face an August trial on aiding and abetting charges. The defense hasn’t said whether Chauvin will testify in his own defense.",
    "The George Floyd uprising that began in Minneapolis introduced the demand of defunding the police to the general public, empowered Black-led anti-police violence movements across the planet, generated policy changes in cities across the US, and most importantly built new organizations which have the capacity to fight for systemic change for the long haul. The uprising brought a lot of reforms and positive developments to its birth city, too, including a move to actually defund the Minneapolis police department and redistribute funds to services with a larger potential for eradicating both crime and poverty. Now, however, the Minneapolis and Minnesota governments are in the process of undoing that progress and moving in the opposite direction. The trial of Derek Chauvin, the officer who publicly killed 46-year-old George Floyd – and inadvertently triggered what may have been the largest protest movement in US history – began this week. Instead of becoming more transparent and committed to undoing the anti-Black image it has cultivated, the city of Minneapolis has quickly transformed itself into a 21st-century police state, pushing even beyond the hyper-militarization and violence that already plague police departments across the US.For a while it seemed that Minneapolis was headed on a better path. A veto-proof majority of city council members previously promised to dismantle the police department and build something better to replace it. Their attempts were dashed by the Minneapolis Charter Commission that shut down a ballot initiative that would have given voters the chance to abolish the police department in favor of a proposed department of community safety and violence prevention. By this winter, the summer’s ambitions had been replaced by a renewed commitment to the status quo. The police budget was cut by a mere $8m – out of a total budget of $179m – and a proposal to modestly reduce the size of the police force was shot down by city council members and Mayor Jacob Frey, who would be more useful to the world as a Justin Trudeau impersonator than an elected official. While the cut is a step towards disinvesting in police, it pales in comparison to the city council’s more genuinely radical rhetoric.Some of the blame for this policy about-face lies with the city’s rising violent crime rate and the subsequent push by some within Minneapolis for increased policing. This uptick in crime has been seen across the country and may add fuel to fiery opposition to police abolition activism. In fact, adding more police is hardly ever the real solution to increased crime rates, though it is often the first that cities reach for. There is no conclusive evidence that the overpolicing of the 1990s and the rise of mass incarceration is what caused the decline in crime that occurred towards the end of that decade. A growing number of sociologists and other social scientists believe that there is a abundance of historical evidence that shows that violent crime, particularly murder, is deeply correlated with political instability and a lack of faith in government institutions. Considering the pandemic and decades of unresolved social crises like police violence against Black people (only one Minnesota police officer has been convicted for on-duty killing in recent history), it shouldn’t surprise us that public trust in government is near historic lows. Increasing police presence, especially in moments of justified tension, will only continue this trend.That seems like the direction that the state of Minnesota, and Minneapolis more specifically, is headed as they prepare for protests in response to a potential acquittal of yet another police officer caught executing someone on camera. Governor Tim Walz has issued an order authorizing national guard troops to be sent into Minneapolis at the request of Frey. The governor has also proposed $35m in state aid to fund the deployment of police officers from across the state to support the Minneapolis police department in the case of “extraordinary public safety events”. The state is also coordinating with the FBI, the federal joint terrorism taskforce, and the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.The Hennepin county government center, the location of the trial, is being turned into a fortress. Several layers of high-security barbed-wire fences line the area around the center and a few buildings around it; they are reinforced with large concrete barriers which, combined with up to 2,000 national guard soldiers, give the impression that the city is ready to fight its own people. Speaking to ABC News, Kandace Montgomery, the current co-director of the local Black liberation organization Black Visions, responded to the city’s preparations:“As the people of Minneapolis and Minnesota are calling for justice and healing, and care, state officials have been responding in some ways by basically preparing to go to war with folks … So, I do think it’s meant to be an intimidation tactic.”In arguably its most dystopian move, the city also wanted to pay social media influencers to share messages during the trial to prevent potential rioting. The city planned on giving six influencers $2,000 a day each to combat “misinformation”. In January the city approved over a million dollars to fund a communication strategy that would include community organizations and influencers, specifically targeting “Black, Somali/East African, Native American, Hmong and Hispanic” communities by sharing “city-generated and approved messages” – which local activists have compared to the Ghetto Informant Program that Cointelpro used to hinder Black movements in the 1960s. After anger from community members, the influencer plan has been scrapped, though the city still plans on communicating with local leaders – excluding organizations like Black Visions who helped popularize the “defund the police” demand.People in Minneapolis are preparing for the trial in their own ways. Some organizers have already planned protests, while others are rebuilding mutual aid networks to support each other with grocery runs and resources in case of unrest. The Corcoran Neighborhood Organization is encouraging text chains among neighbors and has initiated neighborhood patrols. Frey insists that these preparations are unnecessary, but there is a strong lack of faith in the city’s ability to keep people safe, from police, and white supremacists, who have occasionally used moments of upheaval to attack protesters, like the 2015 shooting of five Minneapolis activists by white supremacists during protests over the police killing of Jamar Clark. The city’s plans thus far seem to be more concerned about what have statistically been peaceful protests than with the very real threat of white supremacist violence.Instead of committing to police reform and transparency – or acknowledging the growing threat of the far right – the city of Minneapolis is, in the words of city councilman Jeremiah Ellison, “showing up ready for war”.Akin Olla is a Nigerian-American political strategist and organizer.

    "Andrea Jenkins lives just a few blocks away from 38th and Chicago, the crossroads in Minneapolis where George Floyd was killed on 25 May last year. She spent two decades of her life working to revitalise the community there, and kicked off her 2017 campaign for the city council’s Eighth ward in an arts centre a few yards away.After Floyd’s death, when the crossroads became a space for collective mourning, Jenkins visited every day. But in the midst of a bitter Minneapolis winter and with the neighbourhood reeling from the long-term effects of Floyd’s death, Jenkins hasn’t been in months.“It breaks my heart,” she says. “I knew every single business owner up there by name. Many of them are struggling – the few who are still there.” After years of economic upswing and community growth, Floyd’s death changed everything. “ When I walk through there, especially in winter time, it’s cold, people are shivering, there’s fire burning out of garbage cans. It looks like a scene out of Mad Max.”These are the consequences of fatal police violence in countless societies around the US, where the ramifications can extend beyond personal grief and trauma, and deep into the fabric of local community relations. But in the case of George Floyd, the repercussions spread so much wider – throughout the world – igniting a global discussion on race and racism.Jenkins, the first Black, openly transgender woman elected to public office in the US, became one of the most forceful voices to emanate from Minneapolis. She is not only a politician but also a poet, oral historian and an activist. She sang gospel in front of the nation’s media at a press conference in the days after Floyd’s death and played a central role in re-examining how the city’s long-criticised police force was funded. She insisted that racism be treated as a national public health emergency. And this month, with the murder trial of former officer Derek Chauvin, she is trying to prepare the city for the potential fallout.“It’s going to be traumatic,” she says of the trial, as we talk over Zoom. “We want to have as peaceful a situation as we can, and really have resources there for people to turn to if there are challenges.” She is in regular contact with members of Floyd’s family, who are equally worried. “But they’re really more concerned about justice,” she says. “They want to see justice and they want to make sure that George Floyd’s name is honoured for the role that his legacy plays in social justice.”Jenkins first saw the eyewitness video of Floyd’s death a few hours after the incident, at around 1am the following morning. She recalls it with vivid indignation. “The first thing was the callousness. The sort of relaxed cockiness. The sunglasses on the top of his [Chauvin’s] head. Hands in his pockets. You know, it just reeked of racism,” she says. “Literally he knew he was being filmed … and he just didn’t stop. To me that goes beyond police brutality. It enters into the realm of just pure, unadulterated racism. And that, unfortunately, is at the core of our society.“We can’t fight what we don’t name. We can’t cure what we don’t name. And so my whole point in declaring racism as a public health crisis is because racism is killing Black people.”Jenkins grew up on the West Side of Chicago, in neighbourhoods she describes as “hard-working and low-income”. Her father battled heroin addiction and spent much of her childhood incarcerated. She was raised mostly by her mother, who worked as an office administrator and brought up her two children, as well as two of Jenkins’s cousins, in a “pretty authoritarian” but “very loving” manner, emphasising the need for a good education.She discovered literature and poetry at a young age. In first grade, her class was visited by Gwendolyn Brooks, the Pulitzer prize-winning poet laureate of Illinois. “I just remember her saying ‘everyone can be a poet’,” she recalls. At the age of 14, Jenkins was taught by the poet Haki Madhubuti, one of the founders of Third World Press, now the largest independent Black-owned publisher in the US. “That’s when I really got indoctrinated into Black history, Black culture, the 1960s Black arts movement. Haki was really a believer that you must use poetry for social justice, and all Black artists should be using their art to uplift the race.” She roots around for an old volume of poetry in a large bookcase behind her and sweeps her braided hair to one side. She reads me one of her favourite poems from that time, I Wonta Thank Ya, by the Black poet Tejumola Ologboni. She looks up, occasionally, with piercing eyes. She began writing in her mid-teens, and has contributed to and authored a number of acclaimed volumes of poetry, often dealing with intersectional issues of race, social justice, gender and sexuality. But at the beginning, her own gender was never a subject. “I was thinking about it,” she says, “but I would never, at that point in life, express my inner gender identity thoughts in a poem.”At 18, Jenkins moved to Minneapolis for university, and lived in male dorms. “In many ways a lot of my life was really trying to hide from what I knew to be true inside myself. I played football in high school. I joined a fraternity. Even younger, I was in the boy scouts. Because, you know, I didn’t want to be a girl. I knew I was a girl, but I didn’t want people to reject me.”In the early 1980s, Prince and other now high-profile musicians, such as Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, were making their names in Minneapolis. But when Jenkins arrived on campus, which was overwhelmingly populated by white students, it was a culture shock, from the racial stereotyping she experienced (false assumptions she had come to university on an athletic scholarship) to the stark differences in resources.But it was the fraternity that left the most traumatic memories. “I was outed by one of my fraternity brothers,” she says, volunteering the story slowly and carefully. “We were roommates, and he came home from work early one day sick, and I was in the apartment having sex with another man.” The roommate told the rest of Jenkins’s fraternity, who expelled her from the house, forcing her to return to Chicago “because I didn’t have a place to stay”.“I had to tell my mom, like: ‘Why am I home?’ So I came out as bi, which was very true.” She still identifies as bisexual. Her mother took her back home, Jenkins says, thinking “maybe this is a phase”. “I knew at that time I was trans, but again I could just not accept it for myself, and so consequently could not tell my parents or anybody about it,” she says.Instead Jenkins married a woman in her mid-20s, and had a daughter who remains “the absolute love of my life”. It was only after she divorced at the age of 30 that she came out as a trans woman. “I just really realised that I can’t go on any more, hiding the truth from myself. Hiding the truth from those who I love. If I am going to thrive in life, I have to come to grips with who I am, and I have to accept it.”She eventually returned to college and finished her bachelor’s degree at 38, and went on to complete two master’s degrees. Her family are now fully supportive. “They still love me. They still support me. And it took some time to get to that with my immediate family in the very beginning. But people were willing to work through it, people stayed engaged. They did not banish me from existence, which is a lot more than what some families give.”Jenkins was elected in 2017 with more than 70% of the vote, and was voted vice-president of the council shortly afterwards. She had spent decades in local government beforehand, working as a policy aide to other council members and building up strong grassroots networks. Did she feel she was overqualified at the point, in her late 50s, when she launched her campaign? “I don’t believe in the word overqualified. You’re either qualified, or you’re not,” she says, laughing knowingly. “I do feel like being a Black, trans woman made it really important for me to be qualified for the role. Some people can be a reality TV star, and fucking become president. But some of us others have to really pay dues.”Transgender women, and particularly trans women of colour, face “an epidemic” of violence in US society, according to the American Medical Association. Last year, at least 44 transgender and gender non-conforming people were murdered in the US, the highest annual death toll recorded according to the Human Rights Campaign. The grim reality only serves to underline the significance of Jenkins’s political career. Although her jurisdiction may be limited, she still hears from transgender people from all over the state and the country seeking guidance and help. “I have not personally experienced violence, thank God,” she says. “But I’ve certainly experienced humiliation and verbal abuse.” There were “traumatic” and “potentially debilitating” slurs that she doesn’t wish to spell out.Donald Trump’s assault on the rights of the LGBTQ+ community only heightened the climate of persecution. During Trump’s time as president, the administration introduced a raft of anti-trans legislation, from a transgender military ban, to loosening protections in medical care and other public services by narrowing the legal definition of sex discrimination. During his first public appearance out of office, at last month’s Conservative Political Action Conference, Trump used a rambling speech to make a number of transphobic slurs, pushing the issue further into the rightwing culture wars that continue to rage even after his comprehensive defeat in the presidential election.Joe Biden has already repealed some of the executive action Trump took to curtail LGBTQ+ rights. But, says Jenkins, the administration needs to follow through with its pledge to sign the Equality Act, which would ban discrimination against people based on sexual orientation and gender identity. The bill has already passed the House, but, with a razor-thin Democratic majority in the Senate, its overall fate remains unclear. Away from federal legislation, over which she has no political control, Jenkins hopes that, within the next two decades, the global discussion around gender identity will have moved far beyond the stasis of the past few years.“This thing that we call gender, it’s going to be so different 25 years from now,” she says. “The reality that there are more than two binary gender identities will be, I believe, widely accepted and widely realised by people in the world. It’s only a matter of time. This whole conservative movement … is a last gasp to hold on to power and authority.”In Minneapolis, where Jenkins holds her formal political power, she has played a pivotal role in the city’s reimagining of its public safety and policing. The city council had initially considered disbanding its entire police department, a drastic move that was eventually reconsidered, leading instead to a swathe of budget transparency measures, oversight and reallocation of resources. The most striking of which was reallocating nearly $8m into launching new mental health teams that will respond to certain 911 calls.Jenkins is positive about the reforms, but honest. “To be quite frank with you, I am not sure if anything has really changed or if anything really will change. Because it’s in people’s hearts,” she says. “When those cops are out there on the streets, it doesn’t matter how many fucking rules I make. When they killed Jamar Clark [an unarmed African American man killed by Minneapolis police in 2015] that took 61 seconds – from the second the police arrived until Jamar Clark had a bullet in his brain. So I can make them have a body camera, I can give them de-escalation training, and all of these things, and he still fucking shoots the kid in 61 seconds.”It sounds almost as though, despite being an elected representative, she still feels a sense of powerlessness. “You know what gives me a sense of powerlessness?” she asks, pointing out that we are talking just days after 43 Republican senators voted to acquit Trump in his second impeachment trial. “The United States Senate said that white supremacy is OK. That breaking the rules for white men is fine. We don’t give a fuck. But if you so much as sneeze in the wrong direction, Black man, we will kill you in the streets.”She checks herself for a second and takes a breath. “Yes, I’m a policymaker, but all of these systems are so ingrained around us,” she says. “I’ve got to be optimistic that things can change, right? I’ve got to maintain hope. That’s the only thing that has really kept Black people in survival in this country; hope.”",
    "Attorneys in the murder trial of Derek Chauvin, an ex-Minneapolis police officer charged over George Floyd’s death last year, questioned potential jurors on Wednesday about their attitudes toward both law enforcement and the Black Lives Matter movement.This week marks week one of the unusually long, three-week period of jury selection. It is an extensive process during which attorneys ask the prospective jurors one by one whether they could keep an open mind, what they think of the criminal justice system, how they resolve conflicts and more.Questioning began on Monday 8 March and continued through Wednesday when two more jurors were seated, bringing the total to five of the 12 required jurors now seated.Of the five jurors, three are white men, one is a multilingual Black man who immigrated to the US 14 years ago, and one woman of color.The process actually began months ago, when potential jurors responded to an extensive questionnaire that explored their familiarity with the case and their own contacts with police. The questionnaires have not been made public, and the jurors’ identities are being kept secret. One man selected said he views the racial justice movement more favorably than he does police. The man, who works in sales management and grew up in a mostly white part of central Minnesota, said to the court: “Are there bad police officers? Yes. Are there good ones? Yes. I don’t think it’s right to blame the entire organization.”The man joined three others who were selected for the panel on Tuesday, the first day of jury selection in Derek Chauvin’s trial on second-degree murder and manslaughter charges.Floyd was declared dead on 25 May after Chauvin, who is white, knelt on his neck for eight minutes and 46 seconds. Floyd’s death sparked protests in Minneapolis and beyond, leading to a nationwide reckoning on race. Chauvin and three other officers were fired. The others face an August trial on aiding and abetting charges.Prosecutor Steve Schleicher used a challenge on Wednesday to remove from the panel a woman who has a nephew who is a sheriff’s deputy in western Minnesota. Chauvin’s attorney, Eric Nelson, exercised two of his 15 peremptory challenges on Tuesday on potential jurors who identify as Hispanic, which led prosecutors to object that the jurors were being rejected because of their race.Judge Peter Cahill disagreed, noting that the second Hispanic juror to be dismissed had martial arts experience and referred to Chauvin’s restraint as an “illegal” move.Jury selection is delayed while Cahill considers reviving a third-degree murder charge in addition to Chauvin’s second-degree murder and manslaughter charges. The state asked the Minnesota court of appeals to stop proceedings until that is resolved. The Minnesota supreme court declined to take up the issue of third-degree murder, leaving the decision to include the charge and continue with the trial in Cahill’s hands. ",
    "Former Minneapolis police officer is charged with second-degree murder and manslaughter in the killing of George Floyd The first three jurors were seated and several rejected by Tuesday afternoon in the trial of a former Minneapolis police officer charged in the killing of George Floyd began on Tuesday, after a 24-hour delay for legal reasons.The first potential juror was excused after she revealed during questioning that she thought the way the officer acted was “not fair”.The woman said she saw bystander video showing Derek Chauvin kneeling on Floyd’s neck and did not understand why the officer didn’t get up when Floyd said he couldn’t breathe.“That’s not fair because we are humans, you know?” she said.Defense attorney Eric Nelson noted that the woman said on her questionnaire she wanted to be on the jury “to give my opinion of the unjust death of George Floyd”.Potential jurors must show they can set aside their opinions and view evidence fairly.The woman said she would be willing to change her mind if she saw evidence from a different perspective, but Nelson used one of his 15 challenges to dismiss her without providing a reason.Up to three weeks have been allocated for jury selection. Opening arguments are not due before 29 March and presentation of evidence is expected to take two to four weeks.Chauvin is charged with second-degree murder and manslaughter. Jury selection is proceeding despite uncertainty over whether a third-degree murder charge will be added, following an appeals court ruling last Friday.Floyd’s sister, Bridgett Floyd, spoke outside court saying of her brother: “I’m his voice today.”The state has asked the Minnesota court of appeals to stop proceedings until that is resolved, because of fears that going ahead without the roster of charges being solidified could give Chauvin grounds for appeal or lead to the collapse of the case.That could mean a delay of weeks or months but the judge, Peter Cahill, has resisted pressure from prosecutors.Floyd, who was Black, was declared dead on 25 May last year after Chauvin, who is white, pressed his knee against his neck for almost nine minutes, holding his position and casually keeping one hand in his pocket as Floyd begged for his life, persisting even after Floyd went limp.The killing sparked the biggest civil rights uprising in the US since the 1960s, spilling over at times into rioting but reinvigorating the Black Lives Matter movement and forcing a fresh reckoning on police brutality and systemic racism.Chauvin and three other officers were fired and arrested. The others face an August trial on aiding and abetting charges.Cahill ruled on several pre-trial motions on Tuesday, setting parameters for testimony.He said jurors will hear when Chauvin stopped working for the police department but they will not be told he was fired or that the city made a “substantial offer” to settle a lawsuit from Floyd’s family. Those details could imply guilt, Cahill said.The city had no immediate comment on the settlement offer. A message left with an attorney for the Floyd family was not immediately returned.Cahill also ruled that a firefighter heard in the bystander video urging the officers to check Floyd’s pulse will be allowed to testify about what she saw and whether she thought medical intervention was needed.But she will not be allowed to speculate that she could have saved Floyd if she had intervened. Testimony on Chauvin’s training will be allowed.Hundreds gathered outside court on Monday, many carrying signs such as “Justice for George Floyd”, “Convict Killer Cops” and “The whole world is watching”.Bridgett Floydsat in the back of the courtroom for part of the proceedings, her hands crossed in her lap.Chauvin did not have a family member or supporter in the courtroom, the Minneapolis Star Tribune reported on Tuesday.A man who was selected on Tuesday to serve on the jury, a chemist who says he comes to conclusions based on analysis and facts, said he has never watched the video of Floyd’s attempted arrest but that he has seen a still image from the video.When asked if he could decide the case based on the evidence, he said: “I’d rely on what I hear in court.”The man, whom prosecutors said identifies as white, said he supports the Black Lives Matter movement, but views the organization itself unfavorably.He also has an unfavorable view of the pro-police Blue Lives Matter counter-movement. He said everyone should matter the same.“The whole point of that is that all lives should matter equally, and that should include police,” he said.A woman who was selected described herself as a “go-with-the-flow” person who could talk with anyone about anything.The woman, who is related to a police officer near Minneapolis, said she initially had a negative perception of Chauvin because of what she saw in the bystander video.“That video just makes you sad.” she said. “Nobody wants to see somebody die, whether it was his fault or not.”",
    "The judge overseeing the trial of a former Minneapolis police officer accused of murdering George Floyd delayed the start of jury selection on Monday for at least a day while an appeal proceeds over the possible reinstatement of an additional charge.Hundreds of protesters rallied outside the courthouse demanding racial justice and the conviction of Derek Chauvin, who is white and was fired and charged with murder after he knelt on Floyd’s neck when the Black man had been forced to the ground during an attempted arrest last May.Chauvin is charged with second-degree murder and manslaughter but the Minnesota court of appeals ruled last Friday that a previous, lesser charge of third-degree murder should be reinstated in the trial by the judge, Peter Cahill.Eric Nelson, Chauvin’s lead lawyer, told the court on Monday morning that Chauvin would soon ask the Minnesota supreme court to overturn Friday’s order, a process that could take weeks.Prosecutors from the Minnesota attorney general’s office urged the court to delay jury selection until that issue was resolved, fearing that picking a jury when the number of charges was still unresolved could make an appeal easier.Cahill declined. Prosecutors then said they would ask the appeals court to intervene to delay the trial. Cahill suspended the proceedings until Tuesday morning.The second-degree murder charge against Chauvin, 44, carries a maximum prison sentence of 40 years. He also faces federal civil rights charges at a later date.Three other former Minneapolis officers are charged with aiding and abetting murder by Chauvin and are due to be tried together in August.Outside the court building in Minneapolis, blocked with concrete barricades, barbed wire and razor wire, protesters gathered for several blocks early on Monday.They held signs that read: “Justice for George Floyd” and “Convict Killer Cops” as chants of “What did you think no justice, no peace meant?” and “Black lives, they matter here” echoed off the downtown skyscrapers.BREAKING NEWS: The start of Derek Chauvin’s trial has been delayed until tomorrow morning. Demonstrators are outside the Hennepin County Government Center in Minneapolis to protest police brutality. pic.twitter.com/RMbmYd4C4TJoseph Callahan, a 70-year-old peace and justice activist, who started demonstrating in 1968 following the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr and has protested against police killings in Minnesota since 1987, was there.“I made this sign ‘The whole world is watching’ because it’s true. The video of Derek Chauvin torturing George Floyd fortified people in the world,” he told the Guardian on Monday morning.He added: “I hope that Derek Chauvin and the three other cops are convicted, I’m cautiously optimistic that Derek Chauvin will be.”Chauvin denies all the charges.Minneapolis and its adjacent “twin city”, St Paul, are tense with a mix of expectation and, especially among communities of color, some dread. The civil rights uprising after Floyd’s killing spilled over into violence at first but also spurred the biggest protests against systemic racism and police brutality since the 1960s.Protesters on Monday called for justice in the name of Floyd but also for others killed by police in Minnesota and across the US, over decades.In a different kind of demonstration on Sunday protesters in Minneapolis had dressed in all black, silently marching while carrying a banner that read “I Can’t Breathe”, echoing the dying words of George Floyd and other police brutality victims, including Eric Garner in New York City in 2014, and a white casket topped with roses, in a symbolic funeral procession.Marchers also carried a scroll with hundreds of names and dates representing police-involved deaths in Minnesota since 2000.“I’m out here to show support to the community I’m in and help in any way that I can. I believe that the whole system is very corrupt especially towards Black lives,” said Ajah Heikes, a 14-year-old student.The diverse crowd of protesters spanned generations and many racial and ethnic backgrounds.“I’m here because I love Minneapolis and I’m ashamed and horrified that we have allowed this to go on for so long, that our police can be so evil and we don’t address it,” said Mary Everett, 65.She added: “I hope other older white women see that we need to be out here. This is on us, we need to fix this. We created this system, we’ve benefited from it.”There were efforts to disband the police department in Minneapolis after Floyd’s death, restructuring law enforcement and public safety, but they were knocked back.“Justice extends beyond the trial and it extends to ‘how are we as a city going to respond after this trial?’ How are we going to change things so that this doesn’t happen again?” protester Grace Goins, 25, said, adding: “Real change and not just little reforms here and there.”Lawyers for Chauvin have argued that he correctly followed his training in helping colleagues arrest Floyd on suspicion of using a counterfeit $20 bill at the Cup Foods grocery store last May.The medical examiner ruled that Floyd’s death was a homicide caused partly by police restraint holds. But the autopsy report also noted that Floyd had recently ingested the opioid fentanyl, and Chauvin’s lawyers contend that an overdose was the main cause of death.Jury selection is expected to take at least three weeks.“You don’t want jurors who are completely blank slates, because that would mean they’re not in tune at all with the world,” Susan Gaertner, a former prosecutor, said, preferring “jurors who can set aside opinions that have formed prior” and give both sides a fair hearing.",
    "Black communities in Minneapolis and St Paul braced against the dread of justice not being served as trial begins MondayOne of the most significant police trials in US history begins on Monday and as the former officer who killed George Floyd stands before a judge, a jury and the world, many in Black communities in Minneapolis are braced against the dread of justice not being served.Minneapolis and its adjacent “twin city” St Paul, followed by cities and towns all across the United States and overseas burst into civil rights protest last May, where millions demanded radical change after a video went viral showing a cop kneeling on Floyd’s neck for eight minutes and 46 seconds as he begged, in vain, for his life.The since-fired officer, Derek Chauvin, who is white, is charged with second-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter and has been in hiding while out on bail.Three other, also now-ex, officers charged with aiding and abetting stand trial together in August.“I feel kind of scared that we won’t see [what] we want to see. And we’ll be in the streets, like we were the whole summer,” said Zarieah Graves, an activist in Minneapolis.If the officers are acquitted, or convicted but lightly punished “we are going to be upset,” Graves added.When Floyd, 46, a father from Houston who moved to Minneapolis for work, was killed by police his name joined that of Jamar Clark, Philando Castile and many others less well known.More than 200 people have suffered police-involved deaths in Minnesota in the last 20 years, a database compiled by the Minneapolis Star Tribune calculated. While only 7% of Minnesotans are Black they accounted for 26% of those deaths.“That’s what people need to know is that there are hundreds of George Floyds out there in the state of Minnesota alone, that people just don’t seem to know anything about,” Toshira Garraway told the Guardian.Garraway started the activist group Families Supporting Families Against Police Violence when Justin Teigen, her fiance and the father of her child, ended up suffocated in a recycling truck after he fled from a police stop in St Paul in 2009 and was pursued, with the authorities and the family disagreeing over how he came to meet his death.But only one Minnesota police officer has been convicted of murder – Mohamed Noor, who shot dead the Australian life coach Justine Damond after she called police saying she had witnessed an assault in 2017. Damond was white and Noor is Somali American.“Why is it that only the white woman got true justice?” Garraway asked.The sight of other officers not being charged or walking free over the years had “violated community trust”, she added. Noor has appealed.For many, the statistics don’t generate confidence in the court, despite the report last month that Chauvin was initially set to admit third degree murder.“I think people and the police expect that they can do what they want without action, consequences or accountability because of their position of power and their position in our society,” Graves saidChauvin’s trial begins with an unusually long three weeks set aside for jury selection.Downtown in Minneapolis and St Paul, government buildings are blocked off with concrete barriers, chain link fencing and barbed wire. Several thousand officers from various agencies, including 2,000 national guard members, will be on hand in the event of unrest, although the authorities have pledged to allow peaceful demonstrations.The trial will be painful, not only the replaying in excruciating detail of Floyd’s prolonged suffering but also the defense’s expected attempts to use factors such as the drugs found in his system to denigrate him.Astonishingly, relatives of Floyd have been allocated a total of only one seat in court.Bigger issues than the fate of individual officers are at stake. Two weeks after Floyd’s killing, a majority on Minneapolis city council members pledged to “begin the process of ending” the police department, saying it “cannot be reformed” and would be replaced with a new system of public safety.It was the kind of change that the protests were about: calls to end brutal, racist policing and entrenched racism more broadly, and to defund law enforcement began sweeping the US.But in short order the Minneapolis pledge ran into legal barriers at city and state level, as well as pushback from some police reform activists who said a proposed amendment to the city’s charter to remove the police department was too vague and didn’t reflect feedback from the wider community.Nine months on, a group of council members are gathering feedback on a revised charter amendment proposal that, once again, would eliminate Minneapolis’s police department, but include police officers in a new department of public safety.Some reforms happened – bans on “no-knock” search warrants, chokeholds and neck restraints. New policies strengthen the requirements to intervene when excessive force is used and limit who can authorize use of crowd-control weapons.The 2021 Minneapolis budget diverted $7.7m from the police department to crime prevention initiatives, including a mental health co-responder program and the city’s office of violence prevention, which will now take calls regarding thefts and property damage.“Developing a culture within law enforcement that doesn’t produce ‘us versus them’ aspects of policing” will be key going forward, said Tanya Gladney, a sociology and criminal justice professor at the University of St Thomas in St Paul and a member of a statewide board that oversees police standards.“So even when it comes to reform, police officers are on board as well, instead of reform being seen as a threat to officer safety,” Gladney added.The state legislature passed a bill last July that included restrictions on chokeholds and a ban on “warrior-style” police training. It requires officers to intervene if another officer uses excessive force and strengthens processes for reporting and investigating misconduct.“They’re not moving fast enough at all. It’s embarrassing that no major reforms have happened here, and they’re passing George Floyd bills in other states,” said Trahern Crews, spokesperson for Black Lives Matter-Minnesota.Nationally, the House passed the expansive George Floyd Justice in Policing Act last week, seeking to ban racial and religious profiling. It stalled in the Senate last year but Joe Biden said he will sign if it makes it to his desk.“Black communities have suffered from police abuse for as long as we’ve been here,” the California Democratic congresswoman Karen Bass, who reintroduced the bill, told Essence.Violent crime in Minneapolis increased by 21% in 2020, mirroring a national trend. A 15-year high of 533 people reported being hit by gunfire, up from 269 in 2019.A similar crime surge occurred in Ferguson, Missouri, following the 2014 police killing of Michael Brown, according to an analysis from the Council on Criminal Justice and Arnold Ventures.This could be traced to “a pullback in proactive law enforcement by officers who fear they will be unfairly scrutinized”, or to communities drawing “away from police due to breached trust and lost confidence”, the report said, which also cited the strain of the coronavirus pandemic and related financial hardship.“There are going to be some people who are, like, we need more police because there’s more crime. But other people, such as myself, would like to take a more holistic approach,” said Crews.Since June, around 200 of the roughly 800 officers have left the department or taken extended leave.Bob Kroll, the police union leader thought instrumental in blocking attempts to change the department’s culture, retired in January.The city council recently voted to begin hiring more officers, expecting to have 674 by the end of the year.As the spring and summer trials beckon, Minneapolis is back on edge.“I’m nervous, I’m mentally prepared for the worst,” said Brandyn Tulloch, a Minnesota activist and organizer.Protests and even riots would not surprise him. Even a conviction of Chauvin is less important than preventing more brutality.“Until we have a system that doesn’t allow state sanctioned police killings, it’s only a matter of time until we’re in this situation again,” he said.",
    "Ruling from Minnesota court of appeals could delay Derek Chauvin’s trial, which is due to start MondayThe Minnesota court of appeals has ordered a judge to reconsider adding third-degree murder to charges against the former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, who is accused of killing George Floyd last year.The development could delay Chauvin’s trial, which is due to begin with jury selection on Monday.Floyd, who was Black, died on 25 May after Chauvin, who is white, kneeled on his neck while he was handcuffed and pleading that he couldn’t breathe.The killing, which a bystander recorded on video, sparked the biggest civil rights uprising in the US since the 1960s, spilling over at times into rioting but reinvigorating the Black Lives Matter movement and forcing a fresh reckoning on police brutality and broader, systemic racism.The Minnesota court said the Hennepin county district judge Peter Cahill erred last year when he rejected a prosecution motion to reinstate the third-degree murder charge against Chauvin.Cahill should have followed the precedent set by the appeals court when it affirmed the third-degree murder conviction of the former Minneapolis officer Mohamed Noor in the 2017 shooting death of Justine Ruszczyk Damond, the court said. The Australian woman had called 911 to report witnessing a possible sexual assault. Noor is appealing to the state supreme court.It was not clear on Saturday whether Friday’s ruling would delay Chauvin’s trial. He is charged with second-degree murder and manslaughter. Chauvin has the option of appealing the ruling to the state supreme court, which would force Cahill to delay the trial, said Ted Sampsell-Jones at the Mitchell Hamline school of law in St Paul.But if Chauvin doesn’t appeal, the professor added, “then Judge Cahill will almost certainly reinstate the third-degree charge” and jury selection can still begin on Monday, with a further decisions on the extra charge prior to opening arguments due by 29 March.A reinstated third-degree murder count would increase the odds of a murder conviction. Floyd’s family originally urged a first-degree murder charge and outrage is likely if Chauvin is not convicted.Legal experts have said reinstating third-degree murder to the case could be a strategic move by the Minnesota attorney general, Keith Ellison, leading the prosecution, to give jurors more chances to convict, the Minneapolis Star Tribune reported.The charge could be viewed by jurors as a middle ground. It would also allow the prosecution to present multiple theories based on different elements that must be met to convict on the respective charges. It could also serve as a bargaining chip in plea negotiations, Richard Frase of the Robina Institute for Criminal Law and Criminal Justice told the Minneapolis newspaper.Cahill could order a hearing this weekend or make an announcement early on Monday.Donald Trump’s attorney general, Bill Barr, last year rejected a deal for Chauvin to plead guilty to third-degree murder, partly out of concern that it would be seen as too lenient, the New York Times reported last month. The paper added that Chauvin wanted to be spared federal civil rights charges after his murder trial.Minneapolis and its “twin city”, St Paul, have prepared for the trial by erecting barricades, fencing and barbed wire. The Minnesota national guard has been placed on alert, although the authorities insist peaceful protest will be allowed.",
    "At 9.52pm on 8 March 2020, my university sent out an email telling students that we would start our spring break a week early because of a potential Covid-19 case on campus.What they couldn’t tell us right then is that over the course of the two weeks, I’d fly home to Minnesota, fly back to campus in New York to move out and fly back home to finish classes in my family home.There was no way of knowing that a mere two months later I’d be living through the largest civil rights uprising since the 60s – rippling out across the country from Minneapolis and St Paul, sometimes known as the Twin Cities, after the police killed George Floyd.That was on top of the fast-unfolding global pandemic that was forcing me to study from my childhood room.It’s an almost dissociative sensation watching downtown Minneapolis, the city you’ve grown up in for 20 years, burn when you live only a few minutes’ drive away from the flames, in St Paul’s Como neighborhood.No apocalyptic or post-apocalyptic movie could prepare me for the things I saw.After the initial riots there was an eerie atmosphere during the day, as police vehicles and national guard tanks casually patrolled the streets. As soon as the sun set, the scene turned into what felt like a war zone as protesters prepped with medical remedies clashed with armed police dressed in riot gear.I didn’t protest the first two days after George Floyd’s killing because my mother was worried that I would be arrested or killed.The protest flyers and events on social media pleaded with me to take action. On day three, I decided that I couldn’t let others fight our battle alone so I took to the streets.One protest turned into two, days turned into weeks and weeks turned into months of protesting – as much as my body and mental capacity could handle.I went from party-hopping at my university pre-pandemic to protest-hopping in my home state. It became normal to leave home at 10am to protest and not return until night had fallen – due to curfew order – after attending two or three different demonstrations.Lake Street, a few miles from where George Floyd died and the battleground for night one of the riots, was a dystopian sight.The Wells Fargo bank whose free lollipops I craved as a child was completely charred from cars that were set ablaze in the drive-thru.The outside was lined with the few desks and office supplies that survived the fire. The ATMs had been pried open and left empty. Shattered glass crunched under my feet.Black smoke still rose from the heaps of ashes that were once buildings, for miles. It’s surreal watching streets that hold so many memories be reduced to practically nothing. The vast majority of the protests remained peaceful even when violence was acted out against demonstrators.Large-scale global protests showed the world that “good trouble” for change is possible.I think it’s important to make clear that protesters and rioters are not synonymous. Most of the riots were started by instigators who crossed state lines or came from outside the city to intentionally cause destruction and undermine the movement.In the same breath, some riots are expressions of extreme frustration and rage that boil over. I didn’t think the level of frustration and anger mixed with motivation and dedication I possessed in those months was possible.For weeks I had a throbbing headache near my nape. I would sleep but never rest because of paranoia that I could be harmed by the police or white supremacists who had come to counter the civil rights protesters.I woke up to paragraphs from people explaining why the death of George Floyd and other Black bodies were justified.I woke up to other messages from close friends and acquaintances asking if I was safe and encouraging me to continue fighting.From the ashes and rubble, a revolution formed. A revolution that mirrors those my grandmother was born into in Arkansas during the 60s.In her youth she vividly remembers the traumatic experiences of white people refusing to serve her family on a road trip to Mississippi and her white third-grade teacher calling Black students the N-word.Segregation showed itself through Black people living on one side of the railroads while white people lived on the other side and Black people sitting upstairs at the movie theaters.She eventually moved to Minnesota where she thought there would be far less racism – she now knows that she was wrong.“The south was more in-your-face. In Minnesota they try to hide it more but the same things are going on here,” she said.Since my grandmother was a girl, the world has changed in so many ways, yet the fight for justice has been the same for centuries.Now that the cameras are gone and protests are more sporadic, the world seems to have moved on from last summer.The voices that once boomed across the downtown buildings have turned into a murmur. But Minnesota remembers. There is no going back to normal for us. As I drive on the icy streets I spent the summer marching on, I feel a sense of nostalgia and foreshadowing.I’m certain that in the coming weeks, I will find myself marching on these streets again.On 8 March 2021, exactly a year after I opened that email from my university, ex-officer and George Floyd’s killer, Derek Chauvin, is set to go on trial in Minneapolis. So, in effect, does the police department, the city and the criminal justice system itself.",
    "On Wednesday night, the House of Representatives voted to pass the George Floyd Act, named after the Black man killed by Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin last summer. Among many reforms, the act seeks to ban racial profiling, overhaul qualified immunity for police, and ban the use of chokeholds. While these seem like good measures, they are woefully insufficient to stop police violence. These reforms could not have even saved George Floyd’s life.To be clear, Floyd did not die from a chokehold. A police officer put his knee to Floyd’s neck for eight minutes and 46 seconds. A medical examiner’s autopsy reported “cardiopulmonary arrest complicating law enforcement subdual, restraint and neck compression”. Floyd also had blunt force trauma to his head, face and shoulders. Banning chokeholds is important, as we should reduce the number of tactics that the police can employ to be dangerous. However, the problem with policing is precisely that – they can kill people using a diverse number of tactics. Shooting, kneeling, punching, suffocating, Tasing. Congress banned one practice, and not even the one responsible for the homicide.Floyd was also probably not racially profiled. He did not have to be if he was breaking the law. Reportedly, Floyd tried to use a counterfeit $20 bill at a corner store. The clerk called the police because using counterfeit money is illegal. The definition of racial profiling is when police uses someone’s race to suspect that they have committed a crime. Here, Floyd’s act may have constituted a crime and the police showed up to fix it. What’s more criminal than counterfeit cash is the society where people live off of these transactions in corner stores in the first place. The police cannot solve this problem. They can show up and attempt to stop the crime, but they can’t stop the underlying conditions that give rise to it: class exploitation and poverty. Floyd appeared to need cash, not the police.Congress has had several opportunities to give people what they actually need under the pandemic: money. George Floyd had tested positive for Covid-19 in April. By the time of his death, lawmakers had only distributed $1,200 to the public, and not everyone received this stimulus check. I wonder if Floyd would have used a counterfeit $20 if Congress would have issued $2,000 a month to the public as several activists and progressive legislators have been demanding. George Floyd’s blood is on their hands.But instead, Congress does what it always does when the police kill people: give cops more money. The George Floyd Act, named after someone who died because he didn’t have money to cover cigarettes, gives millions of dollars to police in grants. And lawmakers gave the police more money right after they failed to secure a $15 federal minimum wage and failed to deliver on the $2,000 checks they promised to voters who put Democrats in office. But, Congress made sure to include $750m in the George Floyd Act to investigate the deadly use of force by law enforcement. Protesters have been demanding to defund the police to keep us safe; not spend millions of dollars to investigate how we die. We know how we die – the police.The Democratic party has repeatedly said “Black Lives Matter” since the Ferguson uprising in 2014. The Democratic national convention featured images and families involved in racial justice protests. Yet the party has mostly downright ignored the largest network of Black-led organizations, the Movement for Black Lives, who have been demanding that lawmakers pass the Breathe Act, the most comprehensive criminal legal package in the history of the United States. Representatives Ayanna Pressley and Rashida Tlaib announced the legislation last summer. The Breathe Act invests resources in all communities to alleviate police violence by building sustainable neighborhoods and reducing contact with law enforcement. The Act calls for investments in gainful employment, quality housing, and pilots for universal basic income. But Congress would rather pay for police than give resources to the masses of people suffering police violence.And under the George Floyd Act, police will still kill more than 1,000 people every year. The victims will be overwhelmingly poor, Black, and disabled.I completely understand that the political climate might require some compromises on the bill text. Top Democrats will hide behind these arguments to suggest that they will not find support for more progressive legislation. But political will starts with them to plant the seeds among their colleagues to make this possible. They cannot use their Republican colleagues as a shield from criticism when it is actually them, Democrats, who are not committed to more transformational policies. Vice-President Kamala Harris could have overruled the Senate parliamentarian who decided to remove the $15 minimum wage from the new Covid-19 relief package; she did not. The speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, could have stood up and championed the Breathe Act; she kneeled for a photo opportunity wearing Kente cloth instead. And Joe Biden could have kept his promise for $2,000 checks for people facing evictions, hunger and unemployment; he and the first lady put giant hearts on the White House lawn for Valentine’s Day instead.And we will not forget.Derecka Purnell is a Guardian US columnist",

    "Opening statements are March 29 if the jury is complete.MINNEAPOLIS — A judge on Friday denied a defense request to delay or move the trial of a former Minneapolis police officer charged in George Floyd’s death after the announcement of a $27 million settlement for Floyd’s family raised concern about a tainted jury.In a separate ruling, Hennepin County Judge Peter Cahill said he would allow the jury to hear limited evidence from Floyd’s 2019 arrest, but only that pertaining to the cause of Floyd’s death in 2020. He acknowledged there are several similarities between the two incidents, including that Floyd swallowed drugs after police confronted him.The rulings were a blow to Derek Chauvin's defense. His attorney, Eric Nelson, had sought to halt or move the trial due to concerns that the settlement announcement had tainted the jury pool.Jury selection was halfway complete last week when the city of Minneapolis unanimously approved the payout to settle a civil lawsuit over Floyd’s death. Nelson called the timing of the settlement deeply disturbing and unfair, and said it jeopardized Chauvin’s chance for a fair trial. Chauvin is charged with murder and manslaughter.But Cahill, who has called the timing “unfortunate,” said he thought a delay would do nothing to stem the problem of pretrial publicity. As for moving the trial, he said there’s no place in Minnesota that hasn’t been touched by that publicity.The judge had previously denied a defense attempt to allow the year-old arrest at trial. But he heard fresh arguments this week because of drugs found in January in a second search of the police SUV in which the four officers attempted to put Floyd in 2020.He said Thursday that he would allow medical evidence of Floyd's physical reactions, such as his dangerously high blood pressure when he was examined by a paramedic, and a short clip of an officer’s body camera video. He said Floyd’s “emotional behavior” such as calling out to his mother in 2019 won’t be admitted.Nelson argued that similarities between the encounters are relevant, with Floyd calling out for his mother, claiming he had been shot before, crying and putting what appeared to be pills in his mouth.Prosecutor Matthew Frank said the defense was simply looking for a backdoor way to portray Floyd as a bad person, and the only relevant issue in Floyd’s death is how he was treated by police.Floyd, who was Black, was declared dead May 25 after Chauvin, who is white, pressed his knee on Floyd’s neck for about nine minutes while he was handcuffed and pleading that he couldn’t breathe. Floyd’s death, captured on a widely seen bystander video, set off weeks of sometimes-violent protests across the country and led to a national reckoning on racial justice.Just two more jurors were needed for the trial. The 12 jurors seated through Thursday are evenly split by race, with six white jurors, four Black and two multiracial, according to the court. The last two jurors chosen will be alternates.Opening statements are March 29 if the jury is complete. That process was on track to finish nearly a week early despite news that the city would pay a $27 million settlement to Floyd's family.Jurors added Thursday include a white registered nurse in her 50s who assured the court that she wouldn’t draw on her medical knowledge at Chauvin’s trial, and a Black woman in her 60s who said she didn’t watch the entire bystander video of Floyd’s arrest and didn’t know enough to form a firm opinion of Chauvin or Floyd.The 12th juror seated, a white woman in her 40s who works in commercial insurance, said she has experience with someone who struggled with alcohol, and might view someone who uses drugs cautiously, saying they could act violently or aggressively when under the influence.But she said she doesn't believe someone who uses drugs or doesn’t cooperate with police should be treated poorly. “If someone uses drugs, I don’t think there should be ramifications of violence for that,” she said.Three other former officers face an August trial in Floyd’s death on charges of aiding and abetting second-degree murder and manslaughter.",
    "A year after George Floyd’s death, police reform is still top-of-mind and shaping mayoral contests in Minneapolis, New York City, Boston, Atlanta, Detroit and Seattle.The rush to slash police funding and add new limits on use of force in the wake of George Floyd’s death hasn’t stopped policing from emerging as a top issue in big city mayoral contests across the country.In Minneapolis, critics say the mayor should have done more to defund the police department, and the city is on edge as the trial for Floyd's killing begins. In Atlanta, the mayor is facing a challenge from the right amid a spike in crime that has led one wealthy neighborhood to float seceding from the city. And in open races in Seattle and Boston, activists worry candidates who say they support big changes to the police department won’t deliver.The fury of 2020 has quickly become a permanent fixture in urban mayoral politics, creating a litmus test some candidates must pass.“If elected officials don’t take police brutality seriously, people are realizing they can vote them out of office and put someone in their seats who care,” Mary Sheffield, the Detroit City Council president pro tempore, told POLITICO. “Black voters in particular have awakened to see they have the ability wield real power.”A year after Floyd’s death ignited racial justice protests all over the country, police reform is shaping the mayoral contests in Minneapolis, New York City, Boston, Atlanta, Detroit and Seattle.All the cities except New York hold nonpartisan elections, and all are run by Democrats. They all could serve as political barometers ahead of the 2022 congressional midterms, coming during a year in which few states are holding major elections.Here’s a field guide to the issues and the candidates in those half dozen races.MinneapolisGeorge Floyd’s death in this city of 420,000 was the catalyst for racial justice protests across the country, and where the slogan \"Defund the police\" gained national attention. Mayor Jacob Frey ran on a promise to improve the tense relationship between police and city residents when he was elected in 2018. But his campaign pledge came into question after police killed Floyd, which was documented in a disturbing video.Frey soon came under harsh scrutiny in the months that followed, notably when he was booed out of a protest by activists for declining to call for defunding the police. Now, the first-term Frey faces two challengers: Activist Sheila Nezhad, who was an advocate for reallocating police funding as an organizer for grassroots group Reclaim the Block, and former state Rep. Kate Knuth, who supports creating a new police force but not “abolishing“ policing. Both are Democrats.The push to defund the police has skeptics even in deep blue cities. In Minneapolis, the City Council voted to shift some money away from the police department last year, and is pushing a proposal to replace the department with a new public safety agency, but Frey and others have stood in the way of dismantling the force. The city is preparing for the trial of police officer Derek Chauvin, the officer charged with third-degree murder in Floyd's death. Chauvin's trial could spark another round of protests and calls for reform in the city. Minneapolis recently agreed to pay Floyd's family a $27 million settlement in the wake of his death. Many people in Minneapolis are still trying to “fully understand what happened last summer,\" said City Council President Lisa Bender, who is not running for reelection and has not endorsed in the mayoral race. \"People are in a really emotional place about public safety in Minneapolis,” Bender said, describing the city as “tense” ahead of the Chauvin trial. “Folks are really still reeling from what happened last summer.”Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms faces a challenge from City Council President Felicia Moore amid rising homicides in the city. Contested mayoral races are rare in Atlanta, where the last high-profile challenge to an incumbent occurred in the late 1990s. Protests over Floyd's killing came to a head in Atlanta last summer, and Bottoms placed new limits on police use of force in the weeks that followed. Bottoms is seeking a second term after being elected in 2017. Moore, also a Democrat, is running on a platform that includes \"safer neighborhoods\" in response to the city's rising crime rate. \"It is very interesting to see that progressive forces can be put into motion, and engage in the kind of protests we saw and the kind of advocacy we saw, and then see internally a backlash against that,\" said Xochitl Bervera, an attorney and organizer in Atlanta. \"You see the kind of, what I would say, are the status quo holders, the people that have a vested self interest in things staying how they are.\" But even with crime being top of mind for voters, the political environment in Atlanta can't be easily defined as for or against defunding the police, said former Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed. The city's wealthy, majority-white Buckhead neighborhood has even considered seceding from the city so it can create it’s own police force. \"It's really complex,“ Reed said. “I don't think it's the opposite of defund the police. I think that there's a real desire for hands-on involvement. And I think that that has been very difficult in a Covid environment.”\"There was a fracture in the community relationship with the police around the Rayshard Brooks murder, and we really haven't been able to put the relationship between the community and the police back together,\" Reed added. Georgia was a pivotal state in the 2020 election, and the mayoral race in its state capital is likely to draw national attention. Bottoms has also been an ally of President Joe Biden, and was considered for a role in the president's administration. Boston Boston is at an electoral turning point. In a city that has been run by white men for its entire history, the five major candidates to replace outgoing Boston Mayor Marty Walsh are people of color. City Council President Kim Janey will soon be Boston’s first Black woman acting mayor once Walsh is confirmed as Biden’s labor secretary. Janey is is widely expected to enter the race. Already, City Councilors Michelle Wu, Andrea Campbell and Annissa Essaibi George are already running for the seat, along with state Rep.  Jon Santiago and John Barros, Boston's former chief of economic development.Campbell has made reform central to her bid for mayor, and is proposing a $50 million budget cut to the city's police force. Police reform efforts are underway in Boston, a city that's been slow to change its racist reputation. City leaders disappointed activists when they opted to cut 3 percent of the city's police budget last year in a high-profile vote. Walsh convened a task force in the wake of Floyd's death, and recently signed a new law to establish a police accountability office, based off recommendations from that group. Boston is \"ground zero\" for racism and policing problems, said activist Jamarhl Crawford, but he gives credit to Walsh's recent efforts. \"These last two years have seen more done for police reform in Boston than for my entire lifetime,\" said Crawford, who is a member of Boston's police reform task force. Tensions between police and protesters are still high, though. The Boston Police Department faced scrutiny for how it responded to racial justice protests after body cam footage showed one officer beating protesters, and another appear to brag about hitting protesters with his vehicle. Police reform has been a major theme in the race for mayor, but Crawford cautioned that messaging from the candidates may not match what they would do if elected. \"What happened with police reform, in my opinion is, it became the cause célèbre so everybody's talking about it,\" Crawford said. \"In this age of protest and Black Lives Matter and all this type of stuff, I think a lot of people are trying to portray themselves a wee bit more revolutionary than they really are.\" Leadership of the department is also in limbo. Boston Police Commissioner Dennis White was placed on leave just two days after he was appointed the city's top cop, when domestic violence allegations surfaced from the 1990s.New York City New York City saw widespread protests in the wake of Floyd’s death. The city soon pledged to cut $1 billion from the police budget, though the actual amount of funding cut fell short of that goal. Now, almost all the leading mayoral candidates say NYPD Commissioner Dermot Shea should be replaced by the next mayoral administration, though opinions differ on who the new commissioner should be. Well over a dozen serious candidates are vying to replace term-limited Mayor Bill DeBlasio, who has been criticized for losing control of his police department during his time as mayor. Candidates vocal on police issues include Maya Wiley, who used to chair a police watchdog agency, and Dianne Morales, who serves on the board of the city’s Human Services Council. “On the issue of policing, there is a big shift. It is one of the top issues that is discussed. That has not always been the case,” said Kumar Rao of the Working Families Party, a significant third party in New York. “This time around, it’s not just reform that’s at the ballot box, but real transformation and rethinking of how we approach public safety as a whole.” A spike in crime could complicate the push for reform. Major New York City crimes in January were at the highest rate for that month since de Blasio took office in 2014. But political watchers acknowledge the dynamic could change in an instant. \"New York City is always one bad shooting or terrible video away from mass movements in the streets like we saw last summer,” said Eric Phillips, a Democratic strategist and former aide to de Blasio. “In a city that is this dynamic, with this many people, that involves this many every day human interactions, the possibility that will happen in the next several months is high. This could all change overnight.”Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan is seeking a third term  and faces a challenge from Anthony Adams, the former deputy mayor. Adams, who lists reforming police and reducing crime as top priorities, faces an uphill battle against the well-funded mayor.Detroit has one of the highest crime rates in the country, and leaders there have faced calls to reform how police do their jobs. In the fall, a federal judge put a temporary ban on certain use-of-force police measures, including chokeholds.But the city has addressed the push for police reform earlier than some other parts of the country, former Mayor Kenneth Cockrel said. Detroit has a majority-Black police force, and dealt with some police brutality issues decades ago. \"In some ways we went through it earlier and before a number of other cities,\" Cockrel said. \"Certainly after George Floyd's death, like a lot of major cities, we had at [a] certain point, nightly protests that were taking place. But in terms of an actual incident here, there really hasn't been a major inciting incident, I would say, probably in a couple of decades now.\" Still, activists groups are at odds with police and city leaders after racial justice protests in the spring and summer. The race for mayor is still taking shape, said Sheffield, the Detroit councilor. But crime and policing are emerging as top issues. \"People are demanding justice,\" Sheffield said in an email. \"If they feel their mayor and other leaders won’t deliver it and even hinder the pursuit thereof, there will be serious electoral consequences.\"Seattle More than half a dozen candidates have jumped into the open-seat race to replace Mayor Jenny Durkan in Seattle. Among those calling for police reform are Colleen Echohawk of the Chief Seattle Club and City Councilmember M. Lorena González. Racial justice protests reached a fever pitch in the city last year when protesters created a self-described autonomous zone in the Capitol Hill neighborhood. Durkan faced pressure from all sides for her handling of the protests, and announced in December she would not seek a second term.Seattle cut funding from its police budget last year, and now city residents will decide what to do with the freed up funds. \"Those issues are going to be on people's minds when they go to vote,\" Seattle City Councilmember Kshama Sawant said. \"All the candidates are going to be falling over themselves to be the best lipservice-giver to those issues. Now, will we see an actual fighter?\"\"I don't see that happening just yet,\" Sawant added.",
    "The process of questioning jurors has been long and nuanced.MINNEAPOLIS — Jury selection continues Monday in the trial of a former Minneapolis police officer charged in George Floyd's death, with the process halfway complete after the first week.Seven people have been picked to hear evidence in the trial against Derek Chauvin, who is charged with murder and manslaughter. Attorneys will continue questioning jurors one by one until they get to a total of 14. Twelve will deliberate and two will be alternates.Floyd, a Black man, was declared dead on May 25 after Chauvin, who is white, pressed his knee against his neck for about nine minutes. Floyd’s death sparked sometimes violent protests in Minneapolis and beyond and led to a national reckoning on racial justice. Chauvin is charged with second-degree murder, third-degree murder and manslaughter. At least three weeks have been set aside for jury selection.In the midst of jury selection, Minneapolis last week agreed to pay $27 million to settle a civil rights lawsuit from Floyd’s family over his death. Floyd family attorney Ben Crump called it the largest pretrial settlement ever for a civil rights claim. The settlement includes $500,000 for the south Minneapolis neighborhood that includes the 38th and Chicago intersection that has been blocked by barricades since Floyd's death, with a massive metal sculpture and murals in his honor. The city didn’t immediately say how that money would be spent.Legal experts said publicity about the settlement could be bad for the defense, leading some potential jurors to think guilt has been decided. But they doubted it would really affect the criminal trial. Judge Peter Cahill has told members of the jury pool to avoid all news coverage about the case.The process of questioning jurors has been long and nuanced, with attorneys for both sides trying to ferret out potential jurors who may be biased. The defense is striking people who tell the court they already have strong feelings about Chauvin’s guilt. The prosecution, meanwhile, is blocking potential jurors who seem inclined to give police the benefit of the doubt.The seven jurors selected so far include five men and two women. Four of the jurors are white, one is multiracial, one is Black and one is Hispanic. The jurors range in age from their 20s to their 50s.The earliest opening statements would begin in Chauvin's trial is March 29.Three other former officers face an August trial on charges of aiding and abetting second-degree murder and manslaughter.",
    "Floyd’s death sparked sometimes violent protests in Minneapolis and beyond and led to a national reckoning on racial justice.MINNEAPOLIS — The city of Minneapolis on Friday agreed to pay $27 million to settle a civil lawsuit from George Floyd’s family over the Black man’s death in police custody, even as jury selection continued in a former officer’s murder trial.The Minneapolis City Council emerged from closed session to announce the record settlement, which includes $500,000 for the neighborhood where Floyd was arrested. Floyd family attorney Ben Crump called a news conference for 1 p.m. that was to include family members.Crump, in a prepared statement, said it was the largest pretrial civil rights settlement ever, and “sends a powerful message that Black lives do matter and police brutality against people of color must end.”Floyd was declared dead on May 25 after Derek Chauvin, a former officer who is white, pressed his knee against his neck for about nine minutes. Floyd’s death sparked sometimes violent protests in Minneapolis and beyond and led to a national reckoning on racial justice.“I hope that today will center the voices of the family and anything that they would like to share,\" Council President Lisa Bender said. \"But I do want to, on behalf of the entire City Council, offer my deepest condolences to the family of George Floyd, his friends and all of our community who are mourning his loss.”Floyd’s family filed the federal civil rights lawsuit in July against the city, Chauvin and three other fired officers charged in his death. It alleged the officers violated Floyd’s rights when they restrained him, and that the city allowed a culture of excessive force, racism and impunity to flourish in its police force.In 2019, Minneapolis agreed to pay $20 million to the family of Justine Ruszczyk Damond, an unarmed woman who was shot by an officer after she called 911 to report hearing a possible crime happening behind her home.The federal lawsuit sought unspecified compensatory and special damages in an amount to be determined by a jury. It also sought a receiver to be appointed to ensure that the city properly trains and supervises officers in the future.Meanwhile, another potential juror was dismissed Friday after she acknowledged having a negative view of the defendant.The woman, a recent college graduate, said she had seen bystander video of Floyd's arrest and closely read news coverage of the case. In response to a jury pool questionnaire, she said she had a “somewhat negative” view of Chauvin and that she thought he held his knee to Floyd's neck for too long.“I could only watch part of the video, and from what I saw as a human, I, that did not give me a good impression,” she said. She said she did not watch the bystander video in its entirety because “I just couldn’t watch it anymore.”The woman repeatedly said she could put aside her opinions and decide the case on the facts, but Chauvin attorney Eric Nelson nonetheless used one of his 15 challenges to dismiss her.With jury selection in its fourth day, six people have been seated — five men and one woman. Three of those seated are white, one is multiracial, one is Hispanic and one is Black, according to Hennepin County Judge Peter Cahill.Cahill has set aside three weeks for jury selection, with opening statements no sooner than March 29.Friday's quick dismissal echoed others earlier in the case for similar reasons. On Thursday, one woman was dismissed after she said she “can’t unsee the video” of Chauvin pinning Floyd.Nelson pressed the woman hard on whether she could be fair despite her strong opinions.“Looking in your heart and looking in your mind can you assure us you can set all of that aside, all of that, and focus only on the evidence that is presented in this courtroom?” Nelson asked.“I can assure you, but like you mentioned earlier, the video is going to be a big part of the evidence and there’s no changing my mind about that,” she replied.Potential jurors' identities are being protected and they are not shown on livestreamed video of the proceedings.Chauvin and three other officers were fired. The others face an August trial on aiding and abetting charges. The defense hasn't said whether Chauvin will testify in his own defense.",
    "Chauvin already faced second-degree murder and manslaughter charges. MINNEAPOLIS — A judge on Thursday granted prosecutors’ request to add a third-degree murder charge against a former Minneapolis police officer charged in George Floyd’s death, a move that offers jurors an additional option for conviction and finally resolves an issue that might have delayed his trial for months.Hennepin County Judge Peter Cahill reinstated the charge after the former officer, Derek Chauvin, failed to get appellate courts to block it. Cahill had earlier rejected the charge as not warranted by the circumstances of Floyd’s death, but an appellate court ruling in an unrelated case established new grounds for it.Chauvin already faced second-degree murder and manslaughter charges. Legal experts say the additional charge helps prosecutors by giving jurors one more option to convict Chauvin of murder.The dispute over the third-degree murder charge revolved around wording in the law that references an act “eminently dangerous to others.” Cahill had earlier dismissed the charge as not appropriate for the case, where Chauvin’s conduct might be construed as not dangerous to anyone but Floyd.But prosecutors sought to revive the charge after the state’s Court of Appeals recently upheld the third-degree murder conviction of another former Minneapolis police officer in the 2017 killing of an Australian woman. They argued that the ruling established precedent that a third-degree murder charge may be brought even in a case where only a single person is endangered.Arguments over when precedent from former officer Mohamed Noor's case took effect went swiftly to the state’s Supreme Court, which on Wednesday said it would not consider Chauvin’s appeal of the matter. Cahill said Thursday he accepts that precedent is now clear.“I feel bound by that and I feel it would be an abuse of discretion not to grant the motion,\" he said.Floyd was declared dead on May 25 after Chauvin, who is white, pressed his knee against the Black man’s neck for about nine minutes. Floyd’s death sparked sometimes violent protests in Minneapolis and beyond, leading to a nationwide reckoning on race.The ruling came ahead of resumption of jury selection Thursday. Five jurors have been seated after just two days of screening by attorneys and the judge, who has set aside at least three weeks to fill the panel.Attorneys have given considerable attention to the jury pool's attitudes toward police in the first two days of questioning, trying to determine whether they’re more inclined to believe testimony from law enforcement over evidence from other witnesses to the fatal confrontation.The first juror picked Wednesday, a man who works in sales management and grew up in a mostly white part of central Minnesota, acknowledged saying on his written questionnaire that he had a “very favorable” opinion of the Black Lives Matter movement and a “somewhat unfavorable” impression of the Blue Lives Matter countermovement in favor of police, yet “somewhat agreed” that police don’t get the respect they deserve. He said he agrees that there are bad police officers.\"Are there good ones? Yes. So I don’t think it’s right to completely blame the entire organization,” he told the court under questioning from prosecutor Steve Schleicher.He also said he would be more inclined to believe an officer over the word of another witness. But he said he could set aside any ideas about the inherent honesty of an officer and evaluate each witness on their own.The second, a man who works in information technology security, marked “strongly agree” on a question about whether he believes police in his community make him feel safe. His community wasn’t specified — jurors are being drawn from all over Hennepin County, which includes Minneapolis and many of its suburbs.“In my community, I think when there is suspicious activity the police will stop by, they will ask a question,” he said. “I think that sense of community is all we want right? We want to live in a community where we feel safe regardless of race, color and gender.”Schleicher noted that the man also stated in his questionnaire that he strongly disagreed with the concept of “defunding” the police, which has become a political flashpoint locally and across the country in the wake of Floyd’s death.“While I necessarily might not agree with the police action in some situation, I believe that in order for police to make my community safe they have to have the money,” he replied.The questionnaire explores potential jurors' familiarity with the case and their own contacts with police. Their answers have not been made public, and the jurors’ identities are being kept secret. Their racial backgrounds often aren’t disclosed in open court.Chauvin and three other officers were fired. The others face an August trial on aiding and abetting charges. The defense hasn't said whether Chauvin will testify in his own defense.Schleicher used a peremptory challenge Wednesday to remove from the panel a woman who has a nephew who’s a sheriff’s deputy in western Minnesota. She said she was dismayed by the violence that followed Floyd’s death.“I personally didn’t see any usefulness to it,” she said. “I didn’t see anything accomplished by it, except I suppose bring attention to the frustrations of the people involved. But did I see anything useful coming out of the burning of Lake Street and that sort of thing? I did not.”",
    "Prosecutors are asking the Court of Appeals to put Derek Chauvin's trial on hold until the issue of adding the third-degree murder count is resolved. MINNEAPOLIS — The trial of a former Minneapolis police officer charged in George Floyd's death is forging ahead with jury selection, even though a looming appellate ruling could halt the case and delay it for weeks or even months as the state tries to add a third-degree murder count.Prosecutors are asking the Court of Appeals to put Derek Chauvin's trial on hold until the issue of adding the third-degree murder count is resolved. The appeals court did not immediately rule on that request, and Judge Peter Cahill said Monday that he intends to keep the trial on track until he's told to stop.“Unless the Court of Appeals tells me otherwise, we’re going to keep moving,” he said. Jury selection started Tuesday, a day later than scheduled.Chauvin is charged with second-degree murder and manslaughter in Floyd’s death. The Court of Appeals last week ordered Cahill to consider reinstating a third-degree murder charge that he had dismissed. Legal experts say reinstating the charge would improve the odds of getting a conviction. Chauvin’s attorney, Eric Nelson, said Monday he would ask the state Supreme Court to review the issue.On Monday, prosecutors and defense attorneys agreed to dismiss 16 of the first 50 jurors they reviewed “for cause,” based on their answers to a lengthy questionnaire. The dismissals weren’t debated in court, but such dismissals can be for a host of reasons, such as views that indicate a juror can’t be impartial.Floyd was declared dead on May 25 after Chauvin, who is white, pressed his knee against the Black man’s neck for about nine minutes, holding his position even after Floyd went limp. Floyd’s death was captured on widely seen bystander video and sparked sometimes violent protests in Minneapolis and beyond, leading to a nationwide reckoning on race.Chauvin and three other officers were fired; the others face an August trial on aiding and abetting charges.Cahill ruled on pretrial motions Tuesday, setting parameters for trial testimony. Among them, Cahill said jurors will hear when Chauvin stopped working for the police department, but they will not be told that he was fired or that the city made a “substantial offer” to settle a lawsuit with Floyd’s family. Those details will not be allowed because they could imply guilt, Cahill said.The city had no immediate comment when asked about the settlement offer. A message left with an attorney for the Floyd family was not immediately returned.Cahill also ruled that a firefighter who can be heard in the bystander video, urging the officers to check Floyd’s pulse, will be allowed to testify about what she saw, and whether she thought medical intervention was needed, but she will not be able to speculate that she could have saved Floyd if she had intervened. In addition, testimony about what training Chauvin received will be allowed.Hundreds of people gathered outside the courthouse as proceedings began Monday, many carrying signs that read, “Justice for George Floyd” and “Convict Killer Cops.”Inside the courtroom, Chauvin, in a blue suit and black mask, followed the proceedings attentively, making notes on a legal pad. No one attended to support him. Bridgett Floyd, George Floyd’s sister, sat in the seat allocated to Floyd’s family.Afterward, Bridgett Floyd said the family was glad the trial had finally arrived and is “praying for justice.”“I sat in the courthouse today and looked at the officer who took my brother’s life,” she said. “That officer took a great man, a great father, a great brother, a great uncle.”The unintentional second-degree murder charge requires to prosecutors to prove that Chauvin’s conduct was a “substantial causal factor” in Floyd’s death, and that Chauvin was committing felony assault at the time. The third-degree murder charge would require them to prove that Chauvin caused Floyd’s death through a dangerous act without regard for human life.Jury selection could take at least three weeks and will end when 14 jurors are picked — 12 who will deliberate and two alternates.___Associated Press writer Mohamed Ibrahim contributed this report.",
    "Derek Chauvin is charged with second-degree murder and manslaughter in George Floyd’s death.MINNEAPOLIS — The judge overseeing the trial of a former Minneapolis police officer accused in the death of George Floyd on Monday paused jury selection for at least a day while an appeal proceeds over the possible reinstatement of a third-degree murder charge.As hundreds of protesters gathered outside the courthouse to call for the conviction of Derek Chauvin, Judge Peter Cahill said he does not have jurisdiction to rule on whether the third-degree murder charge should be reinstated against the former officer while the issue is being appealed. But he said prosecutors' arguments that the whole case would be impacted was “tenuous.”Cahill initially ruled that jury selection would begin as scheduled on Monday, but prosecutors filed a request with the Court of Appeals to put the trial on hold until the issue is resolved. The judge then sent the potential jurors home for the day, while prosecutors tried to contact the appellate court. Cahill took a recess to give the Court of Appeals time to respond, but planned to bring attorneys back into the courtroom Monday afternoon to deal with other matters.Cahill said he would proceed with the trial unless the higher courts told him to stop.Chauvin is charged with second-degree murder and manslaughter in Floyd’s death. Legal experts say reinstating the third-degree murder charge would improve the odds of getting a conviction. Chauvin's attorney, Eric Nelson, said Monday he would ask the state Supreme Court to review a Court of Appeals decision that ordered Cahill to reconsider the charge.Jury selection is expected to take at least three weeks, as prosecutors and defense attorneys try to weed out people who may be biased against them.“You don’t want jurors who are completely blank slates, because that would mean they’re not in tune at all with the world,” Susan Gaertner, a former prosecutor, said. “But what you want is jurors who can set aside opinions that have formed prior to walking into the courtroom and give both sides a fair hearing.”Floyd was declared dead May 25 after Chauvin, who is white, pressed his knee against the handcuffed Black man's neck for about nine minutes, holding his position even after Floyd went limp. Floyd’s death sparked sometimes violent protests in Minneapolis and beyond, and led to a nationwide reckoning on race.Chauvin and three other officers were fired; the others face an August trial on aiding and abetting charges.Hundreds of people gathered outside the courthouse as proceedings began, many carrying signs that read, “Justice for George Floyd” and “Convict Killer Cops.”One speaker took a microphone and decried the concrete barriers topped by chain-link fencing, barbed wire and razor wire set up around the courthouse. He also ridiculed talk of the Chauvin trial as “the trial of the century,” saying all the jury needs to do is “the right thing.”Then he led the crowd in chants of “The whole world is watching!”Inside the courtroom, Chauvin, in a blue suit and black mask, followed the proceedings attentively, making notes on a legal pad.Nelson earlier argued that pretrial publicity of the case and the subsequent violent unrest in Minneapolis would make it impossible to find an impartial jury in Hennepin County. But Judge Peter Cahill said last year that moving the trial probably wouldn't cure the problem of a potentially tainted jury pool because “no corner of the State of Minnesota” has been shielded from pretrial publicity.The potential jurors — who must be at least 18, U.S. citizens and residents of Hennepin County — were sent questionnaires to determine how much they have heard about the case and whether they’ve formed any opinions. Besides biographical and demographic information, jurors were asked about prior contacts with police, whether they have protested against police brutality and whether they believe the justice system is fair.Some of the questions get specific, such as how often a potential juror has watched the bystander video of Floyd’s arrest, or whether they carried a sign at a protest and what that sign said.Mike Brandt, a local defense attorney, said prosecutors will likely seek out jurors who have favorable opinions on the Black Lives Matter movement or might have more outrage over Floyd’s death, while Chauvin’s attorneys would likely favor jurors who support the police.Unlike typical jury selection proceedings, potential jurors will be questioned individually rather than in a group. The judge, defense attorney and prosecutors will all get to ask questions. The defense can object to up to 15 potential jurors without giving a reason; prosecutors can block up to nine without providing a reason. Either side can object to these peremptory challenges if they believe the sole reason for disqualifying a juror is race or gender.Both sides can also argue to dismiss an unlimited number of jurors “for cause,” meaning they must provide a reason why they believe that juror shouldn’t serve. Those situations can get into some detailed machinations, Brandt said, and it’s up to the judge to decide whether a juror stays or goes.“Sometimes there is some tortured questioning,” Brandt said.He said that even if a juror says they have had a negative interaction with the police, or a negative opinion about Black Lives Matter, the key will be trying to find out whether they can put those past experiences or opinions aside and be fair.“We all walk into these with biases. The question is, can you put those biases aside and be fair in this case,” he said.Jury selection will end after 14 people are picked — 12 jurors who will deliberate the case and two alternates who won’t be part of deliberations unless needed. The jurors will be escorted to the courthouse daily and sequestered during deliberations. Their names will be kept confidential until further order of the court.The number of seats in the courtroom has been limited to maintain social distancing due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and seats for jurors have been spaced out. Like others in the courtroom, jurors will be required to wear masks.The earliest opening statements will begin is March 29.",
    "The vote was almost entirely along party lines.The House passed a sweeping police reform bill Wednesday, nine months after George Floyd’s death galvanized the nation into protests for racial justice and days before his killer goes on trial.The vote was 220-212, with all but two Democrats, Reps. Jared Golden of Maine and Ron Kind of Wisconsin, supporting it. Just one Republican, Rep. Lance Gooden of Texas, voted to pass the bill. Gooden later tweeted that he doesn’t support the bill and said he “changed the official record to reflect my opposition!” (Golden and Kind supported the measure last year, while Gooden opposed it.)The vote was moved up from Thursday over concerns of a potential security threat from “militia violent extremists” who may try to seize control of the complex on or around March 4 — a date some conspiracy theorists believe is when former President Donald Trump will return to power. (Inauguration Day took place on that date until it was changed to Jan. 20 in the 1930s.)The bill was drafted by the Congressional Black Caucus last summer and advanced the House last year in a bipartisan vote that included every Democrat and three Republicans. But it went nowhere in the Senate of Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.).In floor remarks ahead of the vote, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said the bill won’t “erase centuries of systemic racism and excessive policing” or bring back Floyd, Breonna Taylor or any other Black Americans who were killed by police. But it will be “a tremendous step” toward stopping the violence and stemming the suffering, she said.“We cannot accept this epidemic of injustice,” Pelosi said. “We cannot stay silent when our most vulnerable and historically marginalized communities … are being targeted and sometimes killed. That is why today, the House will again pass the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act and send it to the Senate and the president’s desk so that it can finally become the law of the land.”The bill’s revival — and second passage — comes as the trial nears for former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin. Bystanders recorded Chauvin pinning his knee into Floyd’s neck for nearly eight minutes as a group of fellow officers stood by. The footage sparked outrage that transformed into protests across the globe in the middle of the pandemic, with many activists calling for legislators to “defund the police.”Few House Democrats support calls to literally defund police departments — despite House Republicans’ repeated false claims during debate Wednesday that the bill would do just that — but their response to nationwide protests is the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, a measure that civil rights leaders have said is just as important as legislation that came out of the 1960s civil rights movement, like the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act.The bill would prohibit racial and religious profiling by law enforcement at every level while banning chokeholds at the federal level and no-knock warrants in federal drug cases. The federal policies would be tied to law enforcement funding for governments at the state and local levels. The measure would also eliminate qualified immunity for law enforcement, mandate data collection on police encounters and create a nationwide police misconduct registry to hold accountable problematic officers who are fired or leave an agency.Unlike last summer, Democrats now control the Senate and have an ally in the White House. But the bill’s fate in the upper chamber is still uncertain, as Democrats would need at least 10 Republicans to send the legislation to President Joe Biden’s desk.“We will begin those discussions with the Senate immediately after the bill is passed,” Rep. Karen Bass (D-Calif.), who introduced the bill last Congress, told reporters Wednesday morning. Bass expressed confidence on a conference call with reporters Wednesday morning that the bill would draw bipartisan support in Congress and make its way to Biden to be signed into law. She said discussions with senators, including Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and Tim Scott (R-S.C.), have been underway for weeks. At a news conference Wednesday night with Democratic leaders and CBC members, Bass said many GOP senators thought they could come around to supporting the bill last year but had “some difficulties.”“One of the things that has happened in the last 12 months, though, is that many states moved ahead without us, and they started passing reforms,” she said after the vote. “So this time when we sit down to meet, we can talk about reforms that are already in place. … So we have a lot of bases in which to begin discussions, and that’s what we plan to do.”Rep. Jamaal Bowman (D-N.Y.) said he’s excited about some of the provisions but acknowledged that there’s much more work to do around police reform.“We can’t worry about the Senate,” Bowman said in an earlier interview. “We in the House are here to do the people’s job. The people want policing reform.”In a statement following the bill’s passage, Booker said he was “encouraged” by bipartisan conversations he’s having with senators.“I believe comprehensive policing reform is an issue that has and will attract bipartisan support,” he said. “We will work to continue building a diverse coalition of support behind these reform efforts and advance policing reform through the Senate. The time for action is now.”Jury selection for the trial in the Floyd case is set to begin Monday.Maya King and Sarah Ferris contributed reporting.",
    " “It’s one thing to call for a whole-scale transformation. But what does that mean at a granular level?”George Floyd didn’t live to see Kamala Harris become vice president. Nor was he alive to see an investigation into Breonna Taylor’s death find that her killer’s gunfire was justified.But his legacy will determine which America his daughter, Gianna — and the next generation of young Americans — will grow up in: the nation in which a record number of voters can elect a Black woman into the White House. Or the country in which Taylor's killer isn't going to trial, but the officer who shot her neighbors' wall is. After a summer of protests, the coming weeks will show how much has really changed since Floyd’s death — in Washington, D.C., the judicial system, and America itself. Next week, jury selection commences for the trial of Derek Chauvin, the former Minneapolis police officer who was filmed pinning his knee into Floyd’s neck for seven minutes and 46 seconds. And in Congress this week, Democrats are trying once again to shape Floyd’s legacy by advancing federal legislation to reform policing. The House is expected to vote on the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act — again. The bill passed the chamber last summer but was never taken up by the then-Republican-controlled Senate. “In light of what happened to George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, now is the time to get this bill passed and on President Biden’s desk,” said Rep. Joyce Beatty (D-Ohio), chair of the Congressional Black Caucus.The bill would ban chokeholds, end racial and religious profiling, eliminate qualified immunity for law enforcement and mandate data collection on police encounters. Civil rights leaders like Rev. Al Sharpton are pushing for its passage. But centrist Democrats have their concerns about some provisions of the bill. And it’s not clear how it’ll fare in the Senate. Which means it’ll be up to cities and states to overhaul the nation’s beleaguered criminal justice system. But so far, results are mixed. In the wake of Floyd’s death in May, 25 states enacted new policing laws. But even so, some of those new laws have little to do with improved policing or increased accountability. Instead, they focus on lessening bureaucratic hurdles such as easing residency requirements. Other laws prohibit chokeholds, update training standards and require officers to have body-worn cameras. Other notable policies include laws that increase penalties for falsely summoning officers or making false reports. Whether those reforms represent real change depends on whom you ask.“If ‘reimagining policing’ is a phrase, if ‘defund the police’ is a phrase, if ‘abolish the police’ is a phrase, how do we move from essentially a hashtag to budget-specific, legislative-specific, regulatory-specific, community-specific solutions in real time?” said Cornell William Brooks, professor of the practice of public leadership and social justice at Harvard University and a former NAACP president.“It’s one thing to call for a whole-scale transformation,” said Brooks who is working with a team of students to help mayors reimagine what policing looks like in terms of budgets, legislation, regulation and police culture. But it’s just as necessary, Brooks said, “to figure out, ‘What does that mean at a granular level?’”Floyd’s death nine months ago was unlike any of those before him. It was familiar in the sense that, yet again, an unarmed Black American was killed by a white police officer. And as he begged for oxygen, his cries mirrored the language of Eric Garner nearly six years prior. Garner, a Black man who was put into a fatal chokehold by police, repeatedly said, “I can’t breathe,” while under restraint.The deaths of Taylor, Garner, Ahmaud Arbery, Atatiana Jefferson, Botham Jean, Philando Castile, Alton Sterling, Laquan McDonald, Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown, Tamir Rice, Freddie Gray and so many others like them who were killed by police officers or vigilantes sparked outrage and protests. But the aftermath of Floyd’s death was different.“It was just disappointing and really heartbreaking to see just how little progress was made to the point where a police officer could kneel on someone for almost nine minutes, with people videotaping — and they could see folks filming them — with the whole world watching and not care,” said Erika Maye, deputy director of criminal justice and democracy campaigns with the racial justice organization Color Of Change.Footage of Floyd’s fatal encounter reverberated across the globe, uniting people of all races, and igniting worldwide protests for racial justice and against police brutality.“I never expected it to turn into what it did,” New York state Sen. Brian Benjamin said of the ensuing movement. “This took on a life of its own.”“That level of interaction and interest across the board is what changed the game here in New York state,” said Benjamin, a candidate for New York City comptroller, who introduced anti-chokehold legislation after Garner’s death. The bill passed in June in “record time,” Benjamin said. “All of a sudden this became an issue for everybody,” Benjamin said. Last week, leaders from civil rights groups convened a virtual news conference to demand the passage of the federal police reform bill. Sharpton, president of the National Action Network, said the bill is just as important as the legislation that came out of the 1960s civil rights movement — the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act.“We’ll be going to Minneapolis for the jury selection of the police officer that lynched George Floyd with his knee,” Sharpton told reporters. “The family will have to sit there and relive this. “I would hope that they would be able to sit there knowing that the laws have changed and that George was not lynched in vain and that the Senate of 2021 has the same backbone and integrity that the Senate had in 1964.”Floyd’s death has opened a new level of conversation about policing in communities across the country. Despite the villainization of the slogan to “defund the police,” policymakers and policy experts say they’re now able to have conversations about reimagining policing and holding police accountable in a way they couldn’t before.“The defund movement is about taking away resources or shifting resources, which doesn’t do anything for improving accountability and oversight for whatever remains after the defunding or shifting of resources,” said Loren Taylor, an Oakland city council member. “The reality is if you want police to do better, you hold them accountable. If you want them to do less, you take away resources.”Floyd’s death showed plainly the type of experiences Black people have long had with law enforcement, leading to increased support for the Black Lives Matter movement, the acknowledgment of racism and the role it plays in American society, and conversations about addressing the many inequities African Americans face in housing, health care, education, employment and other areas.Still, that talk hasn’t led to action everywhere. As the Chauvin trial nears, Dave Bicking, a board member of Minneapolis-based Communities United Against Police Brutality, said the city is already off to a bad start. Bicking said Minneapolis is creating a false narrative by putting up fences and barbed wire and planning to bring in the National Guard, arguing that police violence is what the city should be concerned about. He also said the city council has fallen short on enacting meaningful, post-Floyd policy changes.“There has been very little change,” Bicking said. “There’s radical talk but no action to speak of. A few steps backward and a process, I think, designed to lead to nowhere.”Despite talk of defunding or even abolishing police in Minneapolis, Bicking said, neither outcome looks likely.“The net effect of it has been virtually nothing has changed,” he added. “The people in our city government don’t act like they realize this is the epicenter of a movement, a huge movement, and something which is history-making and which is for better or worse going to really cause some change here.”Black Americans are hopeful Chauvin will be convicted. But many have learned not to get their hopes up after disappointing outcomes in high-profile cases that have led to acquittal or no indictment in recent years.“Black people have been let down a lot, on so many levels, and when it comes to trust, I think as a people we definitely have trust issues. Rightfully so,” said Kamau Marshall, a former spokesperson for Joe Biden’s presidential campaign and a former senior congressional staffer. “We all know what the outcome should be, but what we’ve seen in the past with various outcomes in most cases have not gone the best way.”Last week, New York Attorney General Letitia James announced that a grand jury voted not to indict any officers involved in the death of Daniel Prude, a Black man who was experiencing a psychotic episode when police handcuffed him, put a mesh hood over his head and pinned him to the ground until he was unconscious. The grand jury’s decision was a disappointment, but not a surprise for Tianna Mañón, CEO of Mañón Media Management and a former journalist who now works with reporters and newsrooms on equity in coverage and storytelling. “You knew this was coming and yet it still hurts,” Mañón said. “It’s a pain you can’t prepare for because these people are just gonna continue living their lives, and not even just continue living their lives but within this community, so to speak.”Sakira Cook, senior director of the justice program at The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, said she hopes the prosecution can prove that Chauvin acted outside the bounds of the law and took Floyd’s life with what he thought was impunity.“It is not often the case that officers are arrested, indicted and then put on trial for these types of incidents,” she said. “So anytime that does happen, that is a step in the right direction.”There’s no consensus on what Floyd’s legacy will be. Some say it’s too soon to say, while others envision a future where police departments cease to exist as conversations about rethinking public safety and who should respond to what continue. But perhaps Floyd’s daughter said it best.“I keep replaying in my mind the clip of his daughter saying, ‘My daddy changed the world,’” Cook said. “And that, for me, sums up beautifully what I hope his legacy will be. I hope we will look at that moment as the spark that ignited a transformation in this country on all fronts but also one that permeated the rest of the globe.”",
    "The departure of Marty Walsh for the Biden administration creates a rare open-seat opportunity in the city — and sets up an election that will be dominated by a debate about issues surrounding race.BOSTON — More than 250 years after a Black man became the first casualty of the American Revolution, felled by British troops during the Boston Massacre, this city of 700,000 still hasn’t elected a mayor who isn’t a white man. Now, nearly a year after George Floyd’s death touched off a national reckoning on race, the two major candidates already running to replace Washington-bound Mayor Marty Walsh are both women of color. There are many more non-white politicians thinking about launching campaigns. And the City Council president, a Black woman, is first in line to become acting mayor.The departure of Walsh — President Joe Biden's nominee for Labor secretary — creates a rare open-seat opportunity in a city where no incumbent has lost reelection in 72 years. The free-for-all that’s likely to ensue, with a pile-on of Democratic candidates vying for one of the most coveted jobs in Massachusetts politics, means there’s no guarantee a woman or non-white candidate will win.But one thing is already clear: The race will be dominated by a debate about the issues surrounding race — and whether the city has done enough, in every facet of its operations, to lift up residents from minority and historically marginalized communities. The outcome could also be a symbol of change for a city that has been slow to shed its racist image. \"Marty's leaving in a moment when this entire country, this entire city, is going through a reckoning on what we're gonna do about race. I want race to be right where it should be at the forefront of these conversations,\" Boston state Rep. Russell Holmes, a member of the Massachusetts Black and Latino Legislative Caucus, said in an interview. \"Whether it be education, transportation, everything that is economic development, the underlying thing that so few of us talk about is race,” he said. “That won't be allowed to happen at this moment.”Those early election-year dynamics in Boston offer a precursor what other major cities will be facing this year: Mayoral contests in Atlanta, Minneapolis, New York City and elsewhere will wrestle with the fallout from the widespread protests for racial justice last spring and summer, and calls for police reform, in the wake of Floyd’s death.The past year has secured the Black Lives Matter movement as a permanent fixture of local politics in American cities, and in states across the country. New York, Minnesota and Connecticut are among states that passed major new police reform laws this year — as did Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker. City budget debates have been shaped by the push to “defund the police.”In Boston, Walsh declared racism a public health crisis in June and hired the city's first chief diversity officer. He convened a police reform task force and, ultimately, signed an ordinance to create a new Office of Police Accountability and Transparency at the beginning of January, establishing a civilian review board for public complaints and bolstering the Boston Police Department's ability to conduct internal investigations. Still, inequality is stark in the city. The net worth of a Black family in the Greater Boston area was $8, while the net work of a white family in the same region was $247,500, according to a 2015 study by the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, Duke University and the New School. And just under a quarter of Boston's middle class is Black, earning between 75 percent to 125 percent of the city's $78,791 median income, according to Boston Indicators, a research project from the nonprofit The Boston Foundation.\"I'm asking all of us to accept this responsibility as our own and commit to fighting racism, our deepest moral obligation,” Walsh said during his final State of the City address this month. “That's our greatest opportunity for growth. No city is better prepared than Boston to meet this moment.\"And tensions are high between police and protesters. Bodycam footage recorded during the George Floyd protests showed Boston police officers shoving protesters and spraying them with pepper spray. In one video, an officer appeared to brag about hitting protesters with his cruiser.Walsh, an Irish-American former labor leader, is leaving the city at a time when the face of Boston politics is changing rapidly. In a matter of years, the city elected a record number of women of color — including Rep. Ayanna Pressley and Suffolk County District Attorney Rachael Rollins — and the most diverse City Council in Boston history.The city is already on track to make history well before an election is held: If confirmed as labor secretary, Walsh's resignation will elevate Council President Kim Janey to acting mayor. Janey would be the first woman and first Black Bostonian to lead the city, and is considering running for a full term. The 2021 race provides another opportunity for change, candidates say.Boston City Council members Michelle Wu and Andrea Campbell launched campaigns in the fall, before it was clear that Walsh would leave the city. Now, more than a dozen state lawmakers, city councilors, law enforcement officials and City Hall employees — many of them Black or Latino — are also weighing campaigns. \"Boston has a unique opportunity to confront its own painful history when it comes to race and racism, and to do the hard work of eradicating systemic inequities. But for us to do that we need to elect leadership that not only understands inequities, but has lived it,\" Campbell said in an interview.\"I give credit to the voters,\" added Campbell, who claims to have raised more money than any Black mayoral candidate in the city's history. \"For electing our district attorney and our congresswoman, diverse candidates that folks didn't think had a chance in winning their races. That momentum is only going to continue given the moment in time we're in.\"Boston has spent years confronting a long history of racism. The city was home to protests and violent clashes in the 1970s that stemmed from the desegregation of Boston public schools. It's taken decades to change some of the city's best-known landmarks. Boston renamed Yawkey Way, the famous street outside Fenway Park, to Jersey Street in 2018. The street had been named after Red Sox owner Tom Yawkey, who resisted integrating the team in the 1950s. The Red Sox was the last baseball team to integrate. Boston became a majority-minority city two decades ago, in the year 2000, according to the Boston Planning and Development Agency. As of 2015, Boston was 54.5 percent Hispanic or non-white. The city is also getting younger; the share of adults under the age of 34 is increasing in Boston.That change in demographics has translated over the last decade into the election of a more diverse slate of public officials in Boston. Slowly at first, then rapidly over the past few years. Wu, who was recently endorsed by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), recalled her 2013 campaign for City Council, when the goal was to double the number of women on the Council from one to two. \"To see just a few election cycles later — going from doubling from one to two, to swearing in the first-ever majority-women, majority-people of color Council in Boston after the 2019 elections — is a remarkable, fast shift in politics in our city,\" Wu said. That sort of movement toward change may be harder to replicate in the mayoral race, however — especially during an off year. Without a congressional midterm or presidential contest to energize voters, the election will likely draw a smaller and different type of electorate. \"In a mayoral election, you get a lot more of the traditional voters — people who work at City Hall, people who have families in the police or fire department, or in the redevelopment office. They may be older voters as well. So it's tough to get those voters to think about big picture issues,\" Suffolk University pollster David Paleologos said. \"In politics, usually we look at leaders as constituent services-type people or big picture people, and very few do both.\"In a city where politics is a pastime, it’s not unusual for an open mayoral race to draw a crowded field of candidates, making it costly and challenging to stand out from the other contenders. Walsh ran against 11 people in 2013. This will be only the second open mayoral race in 28 years. Walsh’s predecessor, Mayor Tom Menino, served for 20 years.But if Janey — the City Council president poised to take over as acting mayor — decides to seek a full term, she'll have the advantage of running as an incumbent. That worked in Menino's favor in the early 1990s. Menino became acting mayor after Mayor Ray Flynn was appointed U.S. ambassador to the Holy See by President Bill Clinton. Menino ran for a full term and was in office for two decades. \"She will have the city machinery under her. That really is a great advantage to show accomplishments, to show leadership, to show that you can handle the job, which is all the things that Tom Menino did. There's risk, though,\" said Drew O'Brien of Burson Cohn & Wolfe, who worked on Menino's 1993 campaign. \"We're in a complicated political and governance situation.\"While the city’s changing demographics will draw a packed, diverse preliminary field, some political players worry it will reduce the chances that a candidate of color makes it to the general election. A similar vote-splitting result played out among progressives on Super Tuesday in Massachusetts, where left-of-center favorites Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren came in second and third place to Joe Biden. That’s a real concern for Eldin Villafañe, of Boston's Barrales Public Affairs, who served as communications director on the campaign of the council’s first-ever Latina member, Julia Mejia.\"My fear is that, among Black and brown candidates that may be throwing their hat in the ring,” Villafañe said, “they will have a real Game of Thrones within our community.\"",
    "We learned something about ourselves on that street corner in Minneapolis.2020 will go down for me as the year I did not travel to Minnesota.Strictly speaking, it is more accurate to say this was the year when I did not travel to my version of Minnesota. My Minnesota is a crisp morning stroll in Northfield — which for decades has billed itself as the home of “Cows, Colleges, and Contentment” — while sipping a steaming cup to go from the Goodbye Blue Monday Coffee House on Division Street. This Minnesota is not so much state as state of mind. Another place I experience it is four hours north, near the western edge of the Mesabi Iron Range, on Pokegama Lake. If you are feeling lazy, you can sit on shore and listen to loons, or if you are feeling energetic, you can join the loons on the water with a canoe trip to Drumbeater Island.In a non-pandemic year, a combination of vacation and personal commitments would take me to the state perhaps four or five times in a year. People here are solid, sensible, a bit stoical, emphatically decent — the Minnesota of myth.As it happens, this year I did don my mask for a daylong work trip to the Minnesota of reality. That’s the state with Derek Chauvin’s knee on George Floyd’s neck. I spent 12 hours on the ground for an interview with Gov. Tim Walz about how he was managing the twin traumas of racial unrest and the coronavirus. Walz, an earnest and amiable fellow who is the first governor in 40 years not to come from the Twin Cities metropolitan area, is trying to lead a once-placid state that now vividly highlights the raw, pus-seeping, I-can’t-stand-you-either sores of the Trump Era. After leaving the governor’s residence on Summit Avenue in St. Paul, a few hundred yards from F. Scott Fitzgerald’s former home, I drove over to Minneapolis to the intersection where Floyd died. “No justice, no peace,” reads a sign at the makeshift monument that has taken over the intersection. Before we delve into that reality, let’s linger a bit longer on myth. A myth is not synonymous with fiction. Those loons on the lake, and those nice people I encounter, actually exist. A myth is more like a distillation of reality, with the uncomfortable and unattractive parts filtered out. This leaves the pleasing and affirming parts in pure form, to lodge deeply in imagination and memory.Most people, in my experience, hold close some mythical destination that is similar to what Minnesota is to me. Perhaps it is Fenway Park, or some diner where the pancakes taste amazing at 3 a.m. in a booth with friends. People from Arkansas like to boast of the biggest watermelons you can possibly imagine. Do you remember what it smells like in your hometown after a sudden summer storm? This is about the crossroads of physical place with internal values, where it is possible to conceive and experience some better version of ourselves.The great national story of 2020, wherever one lives, was the collision of myth and reality. The American mythology is of an exceptional leader among nations. This year’s reality was exceptionalism of the wrong kind, leading in absolute terms in coronavirus infections and deaths, and with a deplorable record even in relative terms as a percent of population. Our shared story, taught to children and commonly embraced by adults, is that we are on the surface a nation of ornery individualists but underneath are the kind of people who put differences aside and pull together when it really matters. Hmm ... Do you think so?This points to what one hopes will be the great story of 2021. That is to prove that our national myths, while plainly not fully real, are at least not fully fraudulent. How does a country recover from lost innocence? A good place to start is to recall that innocence was never really there to be lost.It is on this point that Minnesota is a fine case study. This is true in part because — unlike many Southern states, which were stained from the start by slavery — it is not immediately obvious that this Northern state, with a reputation for Scandinavian-influenced progressivism and civic virtue, might have historic stains of its own.A disclaimer: I’m not actually a Minnesotan. I grew up in western New York, and, though I don’t really think of myself as a Washingtonian, have spent well more than half my life living in the District or the city Alexandria, Va., just across the Potomac. Funny, then, that I often feel as at home in Minnesota as in any place. My father grew up on the Iron Range in Hibbing (just a few blocks away from a boy, eight years younger, who was then known as Robert Zimmerman and later Bob Dylan.) My summers from a young age often brought a trip to Pokegama, in Grand Rapids. Later came four years in Northfield (at Carleton, one of two colleges, along with St. Olaf, invoked in the cows, colleges and contentment slogan.)In 1973, Time Magazine immortalized the state’s romantic conception of itself with a cover that proclaimed, “The Good Life in Minnesota.” It featured the ruddy-faced Democratic governor, Wendell Anderson, in a flannel shirt, holding a freshly caught northern pike. Time’s writer declared, “Some of the nation's more agreeable qualities are evident there: courtesy and fairness, honesty, a capacity for innovation, hard work, intellectual adventure and responsibility.” Garrison Keillor gave this congenial interpretation a satirical spin with his stories about “Lake Wobegon,” the prairie town “where all the women are strong, all the men are good-looking, and all the children are above average.\"How does one go from this version of Minnesota to the version of 2020, when Floyd’s killing on May 25 produced spasms of protests and rioting that left large swaths of Minneapolis boarded up for months after? The answer is with far more continuity in the threads of history than one might suppose.The state, like most places in the United States, was built in part on a foundation of violence and racial animus. My cousins grew up in the small southern Minnesota town of Mankato — where in 1862, the federal government carried out the largest single-day mass execution in American history. The hangings of 38 Native Americans were approved by none other than President Abraham Lincoln, as part of the conflict between the U.S. Army and the Dakota tribe in the state, then four years into statehood. In Northfield, the town celebrates its brave 1876 defeat of the Jesse James Gang with a campy festival and reenactment. But as my college classmate, historian T.J. Stiles, illuminated in an acclaimed biography of James, the story of the James-Younger gang shouldn’t be understood through a prism of Old West romanticism. Though sometimes sentimentalized as a plucky American Robin Hood, James was motivated not just by greed but also by racial hatred and fury over the North’s victory in the Civil War. The Northfield townspeople, some of whom lost their lives in the raid, were able to defeat the invading gang because many of them carried guns and well knew how to use them. They surely would not have described themselves as innocents. Nor would the Minnesotans who engaged in, or helped suppress, violent labor unrest in Minneapolis in the 1930s, or racial unrest in the 1960s. These people may not have recognized Donald Trump as a political type— his personality is a product of modern media — but they would not have been shocked by what now is called “polarization,” or the reality of pervasive malice, identity politics or contempt for the established order that now often defines public life.A certain laconic style is one dimension of the classic Minnesota character. My father, now deceased, was a surgeon, but in summers while a student he worked in the iron mines. He once told me of riding to the mines with older men, people he knew in one context as family friends. But in this context he was emphatically their junior, and they barely spoke a word as they drove to work. Silence, in its own way, can convey authority as powerfully as words.Stoicism, however, sometimes can muffle important truths. Perhaps no surprise, then, that another part of the Minnesota tradition is artists who respond to the stolid exterior of life by penetrating deeply to the contradictions, hypocrisy, and terror that can lie beneath ordinary exteriors. In different ways that is the achievement of such Minnesotans as Sinclair Lewis, who turned his bleak prairie upbringing into the novel “Main Street,” or Fitzgerald, or contemporary authors like Tim O’Brien, who grew up in Worthington, or musicians like Dylan or Prince, who died four years too early to see the streets of his native Minneapolis erupt this summer.There are times, as in 2020, when events shine a glaring light on the gap between professed ideals and life as it is really lived. One response to this exposure is to conclude that the ideals were always a fraud and the mythologies that sustained them are a part of the problem. Another response is to accept paradox as part of our national character, and try anew to narrow the gap between aspiration and achievement. In Minnesota, as in America, myths can serve a useful purpose.",
    "Black voters had Joe Biden’s back. Now he must prove he’s got theirs. When he takes office on Jan. 20, Joe Biden will face a gap between Black and white wealth that has grown into a yawning chasm during the past 10 months. The pandemic has shuttered tens of thousands of businesses and left millions out of work. And communities of color have borne the brunt of the economic devastation, particularly Black-owned businesses that have failed at a far greater rate during the pandemic than white-owned businesses. Many that remain may not survive the current pandemic wave without significant help from the federal government before effective vaccines finally arrive. Biden’s presidency may rise or fall on his ability to execute policies — possibly with a GOP majority in the Senate — that address systemic economic inequality, which often leaves Black families and businesses far more vulnerable to economic shocks. Black families have faced a well-documented pattern of financial discrimination that has stymied their ability to accumulate wealth at the same rate as white families, forcing them to live in neighborhoods with fewer resources. For example, they are denied loans at much higher rates than white families with similar credit profiles — and face higher interest rates when they do qualify. Biden won the White House with enormous help from African American voters, which he acknowledged in his victory speech: “The African American community stood up again for me. They always have my back, and I’ll have yours.”Now, his supporters say, he must deliver. “Had it not been for Black people it would have been difficult for [Biden] to win,” said Ron Busby, president, CEO and founder of the U.S. Black Chambers. Busby said the pandemic exposed inequalities that have long existed: Black people were more likely to get the virus and die from it, more likely to be forced to go into work and less likely to be eligible for federal stimulus programs designed to prop up the economy. “We’ve got to fix that and hold this administration accountable so we can provide opportunities for our own,” he said. People close to the Biden transition team say targeting the higher rate of Black-owned business failures — and the racial wealth gap more broadly — will be a central focus of the new administration. Early measures to target the problem will likely include language in any new stimulus package aimed at making sure money from the Paycheck Protection Program, which is focused on aiding small businesses, goes to firms that may not have gotten access to previous funds, especially minority-owned businesses.“The administration really needs to think creatively to make sure aid gets to some of these small businesses that have been hit so hard,” one person close to the transition said on condition they not be identified because they were not authorized to speak publicly. “We can’t leave them behind. It’s got to be better than what happened before.”Despite Biden’s intentions, he’ll face significant roadblocks, including a divided Congress, a range of pressing priorities and a problem that has deep historical roots. New census data out this week showed white households with median wealth of $171,000 compared with $25,000 for Hispanic households and $9,567 for Black households in 2017. That gap has only widened among people with college education: Families headed by a college-educated Black person saw their wealth decline by nearly half compared with families headed by a college-educated white person between 1989 and 2016, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. “The Biden administration can certainly begin to do this work and begin to support policies that will eliminate racism and discrimination in our economy,” said Rep. Maxine Waters, (D-Calif.) who chairs the House Financial Services Committee. Waters said that more banks and other financial institutions have been receptive to addressing the wealth gap and ending lending discrimination since George Floyd’s death in May. “But it certainly is not something that in a few months or a few years, all of a sudden, he’s going to be able to wipe away all the instances and ways by which inequality has grown and developed.”Many federal government programs created in the stimulus package are set to expire at the end of the year including an eviction moratorium, enhanced unemployment benefits and the Paycheck Protection Program. Black business owners and worker groups say they were largely shut out of the $2 trillion CARES Act. From April to June of this year, 13 percent of jobless Black workers received unemployment benefits, compared with 22 percent for Hispanic workers and 24 percent for white workers, according to analysis from Nyanya Browne and William Spriggs at Howard University. (Their analysis was based on survey data from the National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago.)Spriggs, also chief economist at the AFL-CIO, said Black people are more likely to work in service industry jobs not covered by unemployment assistance programs and live in Southern states that were slow to roll out benefits. He said that to address the imbalance Congress and the new administration would have to redesign unemployment insurance programs instead of just renewing the current program when it lapses at the end of this year. “We are going to have a long period of a very disrupted labor market,” Spriggs said. “They have to think, ‘Am I just going to patch this up? Or do I conceive of something different.’” If all they do is put it back together, Spriggs said, they’ll just end up replicating existing inequities. In addition PPP funds haven’t reached Black businesses owners, which have been especially hard hit because of pandemic related shutdowns and a drop in demand. Between February and April of this year, 41 percent of Black-owned businesses closed, compared with 17 percent of white businesses, according to the New York Federal Reserve.That’s likely because Black-owned businesses often have thinner financial cushions. According to Goldman Sachs, 43 percent of Black-owned businesses expect cash reserves to be gone by the end of this year without more stimulus from Washington. Overall, that number is 30 percent. But the problem with using PPP is that the program relies on banks as intermediaries to distribute capital. And Black-owned businesses often don’t have relationships with banks participating in the program.“There are things implicit in PPP that are detrimental to Black businesses,” said Darrick Hamilton, founding director of the Institute for the Study of Race, Stratification, and Political Economy at The New School. “Using banks as an intermediary won’t help if you don’t have a strong relationship with a commercial bank. It’s a justice issue. Black people should have the same access to capital as white people.”Hamilton suggested the administration focus on direct grants to heavily impacted minority-owned businesses, either through new legislation or through the Small Business Administration.Breaking up big companies is another area progressive economists want the Biden administration to pursue. Outside of going after big tech giants the president didn’t like, the Trump administration did not prioritize legally targeting some of the nation’s largest and most dominant companies such as Amazon and Facebook. But those who study the racial wealth gap suggest that the concentration of growth in a smaller number of very large companies is a critical factor in driving inequality.“For small businesses to thrive you need to have a robust antitrust agenda,” said Heather Boushey, president and CEO of the Washington Center for Equitable Growth. “It’s a super important and under-recognized factor. There is lots of empirical evidence that these things are connected.” The Biden administration can also take steps to address the wealth gap even if Congress doesn’t cooperate. One way to tackle it is through federal contracting. Federal officials could reverse a Trump administration policy of not sharing which firms get federal funds and reinstate an Obama administration policy of paying suppliers upfront for contracts. John Rogers, co-CEO of Ariel Investments, said there should be more transparency around how federal funds are spent. The federal government should track contracts by race and category to ensure that Black-owned businesses are getting deals for professional services — and not just contracts for janitorial or other low-margin industries. What’s more, Rogers said, the administration should use their bully pulpit to ensure private companies are doing the same. When the state of Illinois mandated diversity in company boards, more Black executives benefited from new opportunities, Rogers said. “A lot of companies had a Jackie Robinson moment,” he said. But even forcing companies to be transparent about who gets contracts and sits on boards can create more diversity. “Then pressure builds to move into the 21st century,” Rogers said. “And do the right thing.”",
    "Black Lives Matter leaders turned out the vote. Now they want a piece of the political action.\nThis is the year Black Lives Matter grew from a grassroots, ad-hoc agitator to a potential political powerhouse. And with Joe Biden as president-elect, its leaders are seeking to expand their influence beyond the streets — and into the corridors of Washington. The summer of protests against racial injustice and police violence brought millions to the streets under the banner of Black Lives Matter. It also gave the international movement significant corporate and political muscle, which leaders used to launch a nationwide voter mobilization effort, registering and turning out millions of first-time voters. Armed with an infusion of cash, they launched a political action committee in October — a move that signals their readiness to deal in the mainstream political arena. Next on their agenda: Barnstorming Georgia to get out the vote for the Senate runoffs on Jan. 5. The control of the Senate is on the line and with it, any hopes for the sweeping reforms of the Black Lives Matter political agenda. “The ballot is actually an essential tool to our movement,” Black Lives Matter co-founder Patrisse Cullors said in an interview. “We are both marching and protesting. And we are going to the voting booth. Those are multiple tools in our toolbox to change our system.”But changing the system won’t be easy. As an organization, Black Lives Matter deliberately eschews a central leadership infrastructure, which makes forming consensus around their policy goals more complicated. It doesn’t help, either, that there is growing animosity among Democrats toward the movement. Many blame calls to defund the police — one of activists’ central talking points — for their down ballot losses. Meanwhile, Black Lives Matter leaders argue Democrats aren’t pushing hard enough with criminal justice reform, coronavirus relief and a major police funding overhaul. \"Black Lives Matter, through media and social media, can organize marches all across the world,” said Illinois Rep. Bobby Rush, a former Black Panther. “However, can Black Lives Matter get a bill passed in the House of Representatives? No, I don’t think so.\"The BREATHE Act is one example of this dynamic in play. In July, leaders with the Movement for Black Lives, a coalition of more than 50 social justice organizations affiliated with the Black Lives Matter movement, unveiled the four-part legislative proposal, which calls for mitigating police violence through divestment from law enforcement and investment in communities of color. The proposal was backed by Reps. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) and Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.), but efforts to get it on the DNC platform in August failed. It remains atop the movement’s list of legislative priorities.The George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, drafted in response to the police killings of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, represents Democrats’ efforts to meet protesters’ demands halfway. The bipartisan bill, introduced by Congressional Black Caucus chair Karen Bass (D-Calif.), would end qualified immunity in civil rights suits against police, form national standards for officers' use of force and establish a database to track officer offenses. It passed the House in June and is unlikely to pass the Senate, which drafted its own unsuccessful version. Jessica Byrd, a political strategist and lead organizer with the Movement for Black Lives, said the bill is a positive sign but “not enough,” because it does not address police budgets or the harm wrought on overpoliced communities, which tend to be communities of color.“The idea that you need to make murder illegal when murder is already illegal, is ridiculous,” Byrd said. “We aren't going to take our eyes off of that. And we're not going to allow people to tinker around the edges and tell us that it's progress.”In the weeks leading up to Election Day, lead organizers with the Movement for Black Lives strategized how they would respond to its outcome. If Joe Biden lost, leaders and strategists said, they planned to focus on local races, fighting to elect reform-minded mayors, city and county commissioners. If he won, they would spend the first 100 days of his administration urging him to enact reforms that millions of protesters had been calling for in the streets. Hours after the presidential race was called, Cullors sent Biden and Kamala Harris a letter requesting a meeting. In it, Cullors made it clear that she and movement leaders intended to hold their administration accountable to their demands. “We want to be heard and our agenda to be prioritized,” Cullors wrote. “We issue these expectations not just because Black people are the most consistent and reliable voters for Democrats, but also because Black people are truly living in crisis in a nation that was built on our subjugation.”Leaders with the Movement for Black Lives say they plan to push the Biden-Harris administration to immediately end cash bail and grant amnesty to protesters targeted by the National Guard under President Trump. Any stimulus bill Congress passes, they argue, should specifically provide relief to the Black, Latino and Native communities disproportionately impacted by the coronavirus. In the meantime, Cullors said she’s yet to hear back from Biden or Harris.Tlaib, who supports Black Lives Matter, said she is optimistic about the chances of police reform passing under a Biden administration. The Black Lives Matter movement will not let up on pressuring a Biden administration, she said. “Growing up in Detroit and one of the most beautiful blackest cities in the country, one thing it taught me is that transformative change happens when we organize in the streets and it reaches Congress and it reaches the White House,” said Tlaib. “I'm an extension of that movement work.”This year, the movement helped secure a number of electoral wins, which, its leaders say, proves their political value to the Democratic Party. The height of the Black Lives Matter protests over the summer brought a surge in Democratic voter registrations by about 2 million, according to an analysis by TargetSmart. In addition to galvanizing record turnout in predominantly Black cities like Milwaukee, Philadelphia and Detroit, organizers in Georgia helped register more than 800,000 new voters to help deliver the state for Biden. In January, they’ll be sending one of their own to Congress. Cori Bush, a nurse from Ferguson, Mo., will be the first Black Lives Matter activist elected to national office. Two other progressive candidates heading for Washington, Jamaal Bowman (D-N.Y.) and Ritchie Torres (D-NY), are progressive allies of the movement. What’s more, nearly a dozen major cities also elected progressive district attorneys, including Los Angeles, where incumbent Jackie Lacey was unseated by George Gascón, who ran on a platform promising to stop trying juveniles as adults and end the death penalty. In St. Louis, Kim Gardner, a circuit attorney who was among those who ran with the backing of the Black Lives Matter movement, said that protests in the city in the wake of the police killings of Floyd and Taylor “energized voters to vote and understand that these local prosecutor elections are important.”“It reaffirmed the accountability of local prosecutors as well as the activist community to make sure they hold electeds accountable for what we know needs to be reformed,” Gardner said, citing police accountability as one of the top issues she’s vowed to address. Any chance for Democrats to pass sweeping reforms, however, hinges largely on their control of the Senate, which is why Black Lives Matter activists are planning to travel to Georgia in the coming weeks. Democrats face considerable odds in flipping both Senate seats blue. That won’t stop their lobbying, said Maurice Mitchell, director of the Working Families Party, during a press call last week.“Clearly, if [Mitch] McConnell is in control of the Senate, we anticipate that there will be some obstruction there,” Mitchell said. “But we're going to — on the local, state and federal level — continue to push our demands, and then call on [Biden] to do the things that the president could do even without the ability to pull on the levers of the legislature.”Biden has recognized the role that Black voters played in his election and promised to return the favor in his presidential victory speech. His “Lift Every Voice” plan for Black America aims to address racial disparities in health, the economy, education and criminal justice. His approach to police reform involves reinvestment in the COPS program, which calls for police departments to hire officers that reflect the racial diversity of their communities — a stark contrast from the invest-divest framework activists have been calling for. His office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Still, experts maintain that Black Lives Matter has already made significant inroads even if they are not immediately noticeable. In the long run, some argue, any legislation passed may very likely have its roots in the movement work completed this year.“Biden and Harris can advocate for major reforms of policing while still appearing moderate by saying they oppose defunding the police,” said Omar Wasow, an assistant professor of politics at Princeton University. “For some more militant activists, this might seem like a failure. But if Biden and Harris have been pulled further towards more significant reforms by the Black Lives Matter protests, then the activism made an important difference.”Yet, there are still concerns that the movement’s gains could diminish even after the summer of protest, despite the bolstered national profile and increased support. Rush said he envisions a future in which Black Lives Matter, if it continues on its current trajectory, becomes “its own political apparatus” that will in turn make it “more compromising in its goals and in its virtues.”“It happens all the time in every social movement,” Rush explained. “Every social movement carries with it the seeds of its own disintegration or its own disempowerment … [activists] become less relevant as agents of change. That’s just the reality. They gotta go through that.” Still, Rush said, he feels that even as the movement’s influence waxes and wanes, he’s still optimistic about the progress made.“You can stop a revolutionary but you can’t stop the revolution,” Rush said, invoking the words of his late comrade Fred Hampton. “Revolutionaries have a short lifespan. Revolutionary organizations have a short lifespan. Revolutions don’t.” Laura Barrón-López contributed to this report.",
    "Hennepin County Judge Peter Cahill said he was unpersuaded at the moment that moving the trial would improve security.MINNEAPOLIS — A judge on Thursday rejected defense requests to move the trial of four former Minneapolis police officers charged in George Floyd's death, and also ordered that all four will be tried together instead of separately.Hennepin County Judge Peter Cahill ruled after defense attorneys had argued that pretrial publicity had made it impossible for the four men to get a fair trial in Minneapolis. They had also cited a Sept. 11 hearing in which the men and their attorneys were confronted by angry protesters outside the courthouse, saying it showed that holding the proceeding in the same area where Floyd died would be unsafe for participants. Defense lawyers had argued that witnesses could be intimidated, and jurors could be affected by chants from a crowd outside.But Cahill said he was unpersuaded at the moment that moving the trial would improve security, and that he believes the jury can be protected from outside influences.“No corner of the State of Minnesota has been shielded from pretrial publicity regarding the death of George Floyd. Because of that pervasive media coverage, a change of venue is unlikely to cure the taint of potential prejudicial pretrial publicity,” he wrote.Cahill said he was willing to revisit the issue later if circumstances warrant. Moving the trial away from Minneapolis to a less diverse area of the state also likely would affect the makeup of the jury, though the judge didn't address that issue. In a separate order, however, he said the names of the jurors will be kept confidential.The judge also ruled in another order that the trial can be televised and streamed live from the courtroom.Defense attorneys had also argued that the men should face separate trials, as each officer tried to diminish their own role in Floyd’s arrest by pointing fingers at the other. But Cahill rejected that too, saying the complications of separate trials were too great and that trying the officers together would “ensure that the jury understands ... all of the evidence and the complete picture of Floyd's death.“And it would allow this community, this State and the nation to absorb the verdicts for the four defendants at once,” he concluded.Floyd, a Black man in handcuffs, died May 25 after Derek Chauvin, who is white, pressed his knee against Floyd’s neck as he said he couldn’t breathe. Floyd’s death sparked protests in Minneapolis and beyond, and led to a nationwide reckoning on race. All four officers were fired. They are scheduled to stand trial in March.Chauvin is charged with unintentional second-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. The three other former officers, Thomas Lane, J. Kueng and Tou Thao, are charged with aiding and abetting both counts.Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, whose office is prosecuting the case, said in a statement that the rulings “represent another significant step forward” in the pursuit of justice for Floyd and the community.“The murder of George Floyd occurred in Minneapolis and it is right that the defendants should be tried in Minneapolis,” Ellison said. “It is also true that they acted in concert with each other and the evidence against them is similar, so it is right to try them in one trial.”",
    "The statue in Richmond has long been the subject of controversy.RICHMOND, Va. — A judge on Tuesday ruled in favor of the Democratic Virginia governor’s plans to remove an enormous statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee — but said the state can’t immediately act on his order.The judge dissolved a temporary injunction prohibiting the statue’s removal from a historic avenue in downtown Richmond, but he also suspended his own order pending the resolution of an appeal by a group of residents who live near the statue.“The Lee monument was built to celebrate the Confederacy and uphold white supremacy. This victory moves Virginia forward in removing this relic of the past — one that was erected for all the wrong reasons,” said Gov. Ralph Northam, who announced plans to take down the behemoth in June after the death of George Floyd.Reached by phone, an attorney for the plaintiffs, Patrick McSweeney, confirmed his clients would appeal to the Supreme Court of Virginia.“We’ve got a long ways to go,” McSweeney said.The plaintiffs said in their lawsuit that taking down the bronze equestrian figure installed in 1890 would violate restrictive covenants in deeds that transferred the statue, its soaring pedestal and the land they sit on to the state.The state argued it cannot be forced to forever maintain a statue it says no longer comports with its values.Richmond Circuit Court Judge W. Reilly Marchant sided with the Commonwealth, writing that Virginia had proved that enforcing those deeds would be in violation of “the current public policy.”“The Court therefore holds that, at this time, the restrictive covenants are unenforceable by this Court,” he wrote.Floyd, who was Black, died at the hands of police officers in Minneapolis in May. His death sparked a renewed wave of Confederate monument removals across the U.S., as did a violent 2017 white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, and a mass shooting at a historic African American church in South Carolina.Critics of the statues say they distastefully glorify people who fought to preserve slavery in the South. Others say their removal amounts to erasing history.Four other prominent statues of Confederate leaders have been taken down from city property along Richmond’s historic Monument Avenue since Northam announced plans to remove Lee.The Lee statue, which sits on a state-owned parcel of land, was unveiled before a massive crowd in May 1890, at a time when the Civil War and Reconstruction were over and Jim Crow racial segregation laws were on the rise.",
    "Eleven plaintiffs named in the suit say they were beaten with batons, hit with pepper spray or subjected to “kettling.” NEW YORK — The New York Civil Liberties Union and the Legal Aid Society are suing Mayor Bill de Blasio and NYPD brass, charging they are responsible for the “indiscriminate brutalizing of peaceful protestors” during a wave of demonstrations that swept the city earlier this year.A federal civil rights lawsuit filed Monday morning in Manhattan argues the city’s treatment of protesters who turned out after the killing of George Floyd violated their First and Fourth Amendment rights. De Blasio and Police Commissioner Dermot Shea drew widespread condemnation for police aggression during the demonstrations.“The police response to the protests was brutal, and the wanton display of brute force against people who were out there protesting non-violently was shocking,” NYCLU executive director Donna Lieberman said in an interview. “It was harmful. It was traumatic. And it was unlawful.”News of the lawsuit was first reported by POLITICO.Eleven plaintiffs named in the complaint say that while participating in protests between May 28 and June 28, they were beaten with batons, hit with pepper spray or subjected to “kettling” — a tactic in which police hemmed in and charged protesters. One protester’s arm was broken.Some protesters said they were arrested and jailed without food, water or medical care, in crowded conditions that put them at risk for Covid-19. They also say police failed to wear masks as required by state law.The suit charges that de Blasio, who publicly defended the NYPD’s response to the protests, maintained a de facto policy of allowing police officers to violently target protesters by approving forceful deployments and failing to discipline officers for their actions. In addition to the mayor, Shea and Chief of Department Terence Monahan are named as defendants.“The Mayor of New York and the NYPD’s leadership condoned and even promoted that violence,” the lawsuit says. “As the protests continued and well documented, indisputable patterns of unlawful use of force emerged, the Mayor, the Commissioner, and Chief Monahan deliberately did not take steps to prevent police from using those tactics again and again. Instead, they repeatedly praised the actions of the NYPD, promoting, authorizing, sanctioning and encouraging further violence.”De Blasio instituted a curfew in the city for the first time in decades in response to incidents of looting and vandalism.In the face of outcry over police officers using force to disperse peaceful protesters, including from many of his own former aides and supporters, de Blasio mostly defended the NYPD — maintaining that the police force “uses as light a touch as possible,” though he acknowledged he had not seen widely circulated videos of cops rushing protesters and striking them with batons.“He’s the apologist in chief,” Lieberman said.The suit says the attacks on protesters were directed by NYPD supervising officers, including the highest ranks of police leadership, and carried out in retaliation for the demonstrators’ anti-police message.The actions of de Blasio, Monahan and Shea \"constitute a City policy to engage in excessive force, discriminate on the basis of viewpoint against those fighting for greater police accountability for brutality, and retaliate against people engaged in their constitutionally protected right to protest,\" the suit says.The NYPD said it would review the suit. The mayor's office did not respond to a request for comment.Bronx resident Vidal Guzman, one of the plaintiffs, said he was pepper sprayed in the face while protesting on the Lower East Side at the end of May and fell to the ground when hit with the spray, injuring his leg.“A lot of people got injured that day,” he said. “It felt more like World War III, and the people they were going against were their own citizens.”The suit asks a judge to rule that the city violated the First Amendment, which protects the right to protest, and the Fourth Amendment, which protects against unreasonable search and seizure, and to award damages to the plaintiffs.",
    "Courts have long since struck down legalized segregation, but past attempts to strip the offensive phrases have failed.BIRMINGHAM, Ala. — Alabama voters once again have the chance to remove the racist language of Jim Crow from the state's constitution, which was approved in 1901 to enshrine white supremacy as state law.Courts have long since struck down legalized segregation, but past attempts to strip the offensive phrases have failed. Even though no organized opposition to the measure has emerged this time, some worry that conservative backlash to the Black Lives Matter movement could quash the proposal, which qualified for the ballot months before the nationwide demonstrations that occurred in the wake of the police killing of George Floyd.A measure on the Nov. 3 ballot would allow the state to recompile its 119-year-old constitution in a process supporters say would remove a lingering stain from the state's era of racial segregation and the legalized oppression of Black people.“What we are trying to do with this small measure is to bring the Alabama Constitution into the 21st century and be more reflective of who we are as a state now,” said Rep. Merika Coleman, one of the sponsors of the bipartisan legislation.An amendment would clear the way for excising language from the constitution that bans mixed-race marriages, allows poll taxes, and mandates school segregation. It would also remove duplicate sections from the heavily amended document and put related items all in one section.While eradicating overt racism might seem like a logical move in 2020, approval isn't a given: Voters in the majority white, conservative state have rejected similar proposals twice since 2000.In 2004, conservatives helped kill a move to clean up the constitution by arguing the move could lead to increases in school taxes. Eight years later, education groups and others opposed a similar measure because it retained segregation-era language that denied the constitutional right to education in Alabama.Supporters of the measure are being careful with how they present the issue this year.Called Amendment 4, the proposal as written on statewide ballots does not even mention race. It just says the amendment would let the Legislature “recompile the Alabama Constitution and submit it during the 2022 Regular Session, and provide a process for its ratification by the voters ....\"Supporters are encouraged because no organized opposition has emerged just days ahead of the vote. But they are also wary that conservatives who dominate the state electorate could oppose the amendment if they perceive it as being tied to anti-racism protests.“It’s possible that the backlash will rear its head and people will vote against it,” said Nancy Ekberg, a director of Alabama Citizens for Constitutional Reform, a nonprofit that has been pushing for a rewrite for 20 years.Coleman said there was no connection between the amendment and nationwide protests against racial injustice.“I don’t understand how anyone would conflate the two issues when we passed the measure in 2019 and it was completely bipartisan,” she said.The racial justice movement and remnants of racism are tied to measures in some other states. Voters in neighboring Mississippi will decide on a replacement for the Confederate-themed state flag, and Rhode Island voters will decide whether to remove a reference to plantations from the state's official name.In Alabama, history shows there's reason for supporters of the amendment to worry.Two decades ago, Alabama voters voted to repeal an unenforceable section of the constitution that made it illegal for Black and white people to marry. About 40% voted against the change, and the amendment either passed narrowly or lost in many rural, mostly white counties.If voters OK a reworking this year, a final version of the document would still have to be approved by lawmakers and in another statewide vote in 2022.Republican Gov. Kay Ivey has not taken an official position on the anti-racist measure or any of the five other statewide amendments on the ballot, but she does not oppose any of them, said spokeswoman Gina Maiola.The 1901 constitution was written to establish a \"rigid apartheid” in Alabama, and the white men who wrote it were successful in disenfranchising Black people and poor white people for generations, said historian Wayne Flynt. Large numbers of Black people did not register to vote until after the civil rights gains of the 1960s.Flynt said someone — including a state competing for an economic development project — could use the remaining racist language in the constitution to argue that “nothing in Alabama has changed.”“This referendum and the referendum in ’22 will be a way of opening up the soul of Alabama and see what it looks like on the inside,” Flynt said.",
    "The Supreme Court nominee has two adopted children who are Black. The police killing of George Floyd was “very personal” for Judge Amy Coney Barrett and her children, the Supreme Court nominee said Tuesday. Barrett, who has a Black son and daughter adopted from Haiti, was asked in the second day of her confirmation hearing about the viral video of Floyd dying at the hands of Minneapolis police in May. His death sparked months of nationwide unrest and calls for police reforms, including calls to defund the police.\"All of this was erupting and it was very difficult for her,\" Barrett said of her 17-year-old daughter Vivian's response to the deadly encounter.“Senator, as you might imagine, given that I have two Black children, that was very, very personal for my family,” Barrett told Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), who had asked whether she had seen the video. The judge explained that while her husband had taken her sons on a camping trip that weekend, she and Vivian “wept together in my room” as outrage over Floyd’s death mushroomed and consumed the country. Barrett noted that Floyd’s death and the ensuing unrest were also difficult for her 10-year-old daughter, Juliette, who is white.“I had to try to explain some of this to them,” she told the committee. “I mean my children — to this point in their lives — have had the benefit of growing up in a cocoon where they have not yet experienced hatred or violence. And for Vivian to understand that there would be a risk to her brother or the son she might have one day of that kind of brutality has been an ongoing conversation.” Floyd, who is Black and was unarmed, was killed when a police officer leaned with his knee on Floyd’s neck for nearly nine minutes while Floyd lay handcuffed on the street. Barrett added that the resulting conversation has been “a difficult one for us like it is for Americans all over the country.” Durbin followed up by asking whether Barrett believed systemic racism exists in the United States, a point that activists have sought to hammer home but which some, including President Donald Trump, reject.“I think it is an entirely uncontroversial and obvious statement, given as we have just talked about the George Floyd video, that racism persists in our country,” Barrett replied, but added that addressing the issue was a matter of policy.",
    "Interim Louisville Police Chief Robert Schroeder said a suspect was in custody.LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) — Hours after a Kentucky grand jury brought no charges against Louisville police for Breonna Taylor’s death and protesters took to the streets, authorities said two officers were shot and wounded Wednesday night during the demonstrations expressing anger over the killings of Black people at the hands of police.Interim Louisville Police Chief Robert Schroeder said a suspect was in custody but did not offer details about whether that person was participating in the demonstrations. He says both officers are expected to recover, and one is undergoing surgery.He says the officers were shot after investigating reports of gunfire at an intersection where there was a large crowd.Several shots rang out as protesters in downtown Louisville tried to avoid police blockades, moving down an alleyway as officers lobbed pepper balls, according to an Associated Press journalist. People covered their ears, ran away and frantically looked for places to hide. Police with long guns swarmed the area, then officers in riot gear and military-style vehicles blocked off roadways.The violence comes after prosecutors said two officers who fired their weapons at Taylor, a Black woman, were justified in using force to protect themselves after they faced gunfire from her boyfriend. The only charges were three counts of wanton endangerment against fired Officer Brett Hankison for shooting into a home next to Taylor’s with people inside.The FBI is still investigating potential violations of federal law in connection with the raid at Taylor’s home on March 13.Ben Crump, a lawyer for Taylor’s family, denounced the decision as “outrageous and offensive,” and protesters shouting, “No justice, no peace!” immediately marched through the streets.Scuffles broke out between police and protesters, and some were arrested. Officers fired flash bangs and a few small fires burned in a square that’s been at the center of protests, but it had largely cleared out ahead of a nighttime curfew as demonstrators marched through other parts of downtown Louisville. Dozens of patrol cars blocked the city’s major thoroughfare.Demonstrators also marched in cities like New York, Chicago, Washington, D.C., Atlanta and Philadelphia.Taylor, an emergency medical worker, was shot multiple times by white officers who entered her home during a narcotics investigation. State Attorney General Daniel Cameron said that while the officers had a no-knock warrant, the investigation showed they announced themselves before entering. The warrant used to search her home was connected to a suspect who did not live there, and no drugs were found inside.Along with the killing of George Floyd in Minnesota, Taylor’s case became a major touchstone for nationwide protests that have drawn attention to entrenched racism and demanded police reform. Taylor’s image has been painted on streets, emblazoned on protest signs and silk-screened on T-shirts worn by celebrities. Several prominent African American celebrities joined those urging that the officers be charged.The announcement drew sadness, frustration and anger that the grand jury did not go further. The wanton endangerment charges each carry a sentence of up to five years.Morgan Julianna Lee, a high school student in Charlotte, North Carolina, watched the announcement at home.“It’s almost like a slap in the face,” the 15-year-old said by phone. “If I, as a Black woman, ever need justice, I will never get it.”Gov. Andy Beshear, a Democrat, said he authorized a limited deployment of the National Guard. He also urged Cameron, the state attorney general, to post online all the evidence that could be released without affecting the charges filed.“Those that are currently feeling frustration, feeling hurt, they deserve to know more,” he said.The case exposed the wide gulf between public opinion on justice for those who kill Black Americans and the laws under which those officers are charged, which regularly favor police and do not often result in steep criminal accusations.At a news conference, Cameron spoke to that disconnect: “Criminal law is not meant to respond to every sorrow and grief.”“But my heart breaks for the loss of Miss Taylor. ... My mother, if something was to happen to me, would find it very hard,” he added, choking up.But Cameron, who is the state’s first Black attorney general, said the officers acted in self-defense after Taylor’s boyfriend fired at them. He added that Hankison and the two other officers who entered Taylor’s apartment announced themselves before entering — and so did not execute the warrant as “no knock,” according to the investigation. The city has since banned such warrants.“According to Kentucky law, the use of force by (Officers Jonathan) Mattingly and (Myles) Cosgrove was justified to protect themselves,” he said. “This justification bars us from pursuing criminal charges in Miss Breonna Taylor’s death.”Cameron said an FBI crime lab determined that Cosgrove fired the bullet that killed Taylor.Taylor’s boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, opened fire when police burst in, hitting Mattingly. Walker told police he heard knocking but didn’t know who was coming in and fired in self-defense.Cameron, who is a Republican, is a protégé of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and has been tagged by some as his heir apparent. His was also one of 20 names on President Donald Trump’s list to fill a future Supreme Court vacancy.At a news conference, Trump read a statement from Cameron, saying “justice is not often easy.” He later tweeted that he was “praying for the two police officers that were shot.”Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his running mate, Kamala Harris, are calling for policing reform.Biden says that while a federal investigation continues, “we do not need to wait for the final judgment of that investigation to do more to deliver justice for Breonna.” He said the country should start by addressing excessive force, banning chokeholds and overhauling no-knock warrants.“We must never stop speaking Breonna’s name as we work to reform our justice system, including overhauling no-knock warrants,” Harris said on Twitter.Hankison was fired on June 23. A termination letter sent by interim Louisville Police Chief Robert Schroeder said he had violated procedures by showing “extreme indifference to the value of human life” when he “wantonly and blindly” fired his weapon.Mattingly, Cosgrove and the detective who sought the warrant, Joshua Jaynes, were placed administrative reassignment.Last week, the city settled a lawsuit against the three officers brought by Taylor’s mother, Tamika Palmer, agreeing to pay her $12 million and enact police reforms.",
    "Speaking from the National Archives, the president positioned himself as a defender of American exceptionalism against activists trying to destroy the country’s sense of self.President Donald Trump leaned into the culture wars on Thursday, railing against the Black Lives Matter movement, the 1619 Project and what he called “toxic propaganda” in school curriculum.“We are here today to declare that we will never submit to tyranny,” Trump said. “We will reclaim our history, and our country, for citizens of every race, color, religion and creed.”Trump unleashed a cascade of grievances from the National Archives Museum at an event timed to coincide with the anniversary of the signing of the U.S. Constitution in 1787. Unlike his often-freewheeling rhetoric, Trump hewed closely to his prepared remarks during the speech.“Left-wing mobs have torn down statues of our founders, desecrated our memorials and carried out a campaign of violence and anarchy,” Trump said. “Whether it is the mob on the street, or the cancel culture in the boardroom, the goal is the same: to silence dissent, to scare you out of speaking the truth and to bully Americans into abandoning their values.”Trump positioned himself as a defender of American exceptionalism against activists trying to destroy the country’s sense of self, as he continues to search for a message that resonates with voters as they continue to be battered by the coronavirus pandemic and its resulting economic devastation.“To grow up in America is to live in a land where anything is possible, where anyone can rise and where any dream can come true, all because of the immortal principles our nation’s founders described nearly two and a half centuries ago,” he said.The formal speech is just one element of a broader effort by Trump and his administration to push back against the racial justice protests that have taken off across the country after the police killing of George Floyd, an unarmed Black man, in Minnesota in May.The Office of Management and Budget recently disseminated a directive to federal agencies to stop any use of “critical race theory” or a “divisive, un-American propaganda training session.”The EPA has put off an internal speaker series on environmental racism to review its compliance with the OMB memorandum, and POLITICO reported last week the Department of Education is scouring a host of internal forums, ranging from book clubs to training documents, to root out “Anti-American propaganda” in service of the White House’s directive.Trump has threatened to withhold federal funding from schools in California and elsewhere that include teaching lessons based on The New York Times Magazine’s 1619 Project, which recasts the centrality of slavery’s role in the formation of the country. It is unclear whether the Education Department is seriously considering such an action, or whether it would even be able to go after such funds given that federal law bars it from exerting “any direction, supervision or control” over school curriculum.On Thursday Trump called such teachings a “twisted web of lies” and likened critical race theory to “a form of child abuse.” He said he intended to sign an executive order to form the “1776 Commission” and would serve as a counterweight to promote patriotic education.Nikole Hannah-Jones, creator of the 1619 Project, later tweeted: \"These are hard days we’re in but I take great satisfaction from knowing that now even Trump’s supporters know the date 1619 and mark it as the beginning American slavery. 1619 is part of the national lexicon. That cannot be undone, no matter how hard they try.\"Education Secretary Betsy DeVos on Thursday lauded a rival Black American history initiative, dubbed 1776 Unites, that professes to offer “a more complete and inspiring story of the history of African-Americans in the United States“ than things like the 1619 project.“Curriculum is best left to the states and local districts at local education agencies, but we can talk about curriculum that actually honors and respects our history and embraces all of the parts of our history and continues to build on that,“ DeVos said. “Because we know that if we do not know and understand history, we are bound to repeat it.“The Trump administration’s efforts come as high-profile police killings of Black Americans have escalated racial unrest across the country and elevated its salience in the presidential campaign.The president on Thursday sought to tie turmoil over recent months to the broader effort to combat racial inequality and grapple with racism’s prevalence throughout American history.“The left-wing rioting and mayhem are the direct result of decades of left-wing indoctrination in our schools,” Trump asserted, while making a direct appeal to parents as he seeks to reverse sagging support among suburban voters and other key groups.“American parents are not going to accept indoctrination in our schools, cancel culture at work, or the repression of traditional faith, culture and values in the public square,” Trump said. “Not anymore.”The president’s remarks also included a barb at Joe Biden, the Democratic presidential nominee, with Trump saying he wanted to include a statue of Caesar Rodney, a signer of the Declaration of Independence from Biden’s home state of Delaware, in his proposed monument to “American heroes.” A statue in Wilmington of Rodney, who owned slaves, was removed in June amid racial justice protests.“Joe Biden said nothing as to his home state’s history and the fact that it was dismantled and dismembered, and a founding father’s statue was removed,” Trump said. “Today, America will give this founding father, this very brave man who was so horribly treated, the place of honor he deserves.”Matthew Choi contributed to this report.",
    "Gov. Tim Walz on leading the state where George Floyd’s killing set off a national reckoning on race and systemic inequity.ST. PAUL, Minn. — As the state where George Floyd died with a Minneapolis police officer’s knee on his neck, Minnesota in 2020 has endured trauma in ways that were beyond Gov. Tim Walz’s imagination.There is something else, however, that is entirely within his imagination: 2021 could easily be worse.The criminal prosecutions of Derek Chauvin and other Minneapolis police officers fired in the aftermath of the Floyd killing are scheduled to begin in March. With the Twin Cities having endured multiple spasms of rioting this past summer and spring, how much is Walz worried about the possibility of further unrest around the trials?“A lot,” Walz told POLITICO. “I think certainly if the verdict comes out a not guilty verdict on that, it will be challenging. And we need to not just think about it — which we’re doing — the physical security of it. It’s these conversations I’m in with Black leadership and trying to be out there.”Walz’s comments came in an interview for “The Fifty,” a POLITICO series exploring the intersection among states, cities and national politics. Walz spoke at a time when he’s making local decisions with decidedly national resonance, given the reckoning on race and systemic inequality that followed Floyd’s killing. Minnesota is a state that has regarded itself as exceptional for its congeniality and healthy civic culture but now finds instead that it is vividly emblematic of the rancor and institutional failures across the country.The governor’s reference to “trying to be out there” in “conversations” with critics is the essence of the Walz political style. The Democrat, a former teacher and member of Congress who won the governorship in 2018, believes he is a reasonable guy who, if he has a chance to sit down and chat with most folks, he can persuade them to be reasonable, too.Is Walz living in a fantasy? Or, more generously, in the past? Even Gwen Walz, the governor’s wife and a high school English teacher, sometimes worries that he is, at least when it comes to dealing with his Republican adversaries. By most evidence, they are little interested in helping Walz carry out the cheerful “One Minnesota” vision he campaigned on.“She’s a little more, ‘They mistake your kindness for weakness and don’t ever do that,'” Walz said of his spouse’s views about the yearning for a collegial bipartisan center she believes is illusion. “But I also think — especially when you’re in an executive position — I still believe our system of checks and balances and compromise created a better, fairer system that worked, and I do not see this oscillation amongst extremes being a better way of governing.” On the surface, Walz’s words seem like a perfectly sensible approach for sensible Minnesota — a place that in its own mythology is uncommonly peaceful and progressive, a culturally centered place in the center of the nation. What happened in 2020 is a collision between that pleasant myth and starkly unpleasant reality. In 2020, the state has been violent, not peaceful. It may still tilt progressive, but there are agitated voices, rising steadily in volume, on both the left and right.This conflict between the self-conception of many Minnesotans and the actual facts of Minnesota life was the recurring theme of an hourlong conversation with the 56-year-old Walz. He’s not that great with Zoom, a staff aide warned. But the Minnesota governor’s residence on Summit Avenue — a few hundred yards down the street from where F. Scott Fitzgerald lived — has a spacious patio with plenty of room to distance. So an in-person interview it was, on a sunny but temperate late-summer day. While Walz talked in an unhurried way, his stocky black lab mix, Scout, sniffed and roamed with an impatient, proprietary air. Extended excerpts of the interview are below. Highlights of Walz’s comments include:— Walz said the eruption of protests, some of which turned violent, in the wake of Floyd’s May 25 death can be understood only in the context of yearslong animosities between minorities and the Minneapolis police: “The faith between the police and those they govern is broken and vice versa. Neither one trusts the other and that creates an untenable situation.”— Walz believes polls saying Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden is up by as much as 7 percentage points in Minnesota, but he warns that President Donald Trump is capable of closing the gap. He said the unrest in the Twin Cities likely exacerbates animosity in “Greater Minnesota” toward the state’s urban core — a tension that is now a central dynamic of the state’s politics. Walz, from the southern Minnesota town of Mankato, is the first governor in 40 years not to come from the Twin Cities metro area. In rural areas, he said, the economic and cultural grievance he finds is palpable: “The [2008-2009] recession did not bounce back as quickly in rural areas. I think they had people telling them that, ‘Hey, the people in the cities are getting over on you.’ … And the president tells them and again, ‘Hey, it’s these folks. Put the blame on these folks in the cities. It’s these folks that are taking away your life,’ and I think people are frustrated.”— Minnesota’s self-perception of being racially progressive is sometimes a hurdle to honest discussion of systemic inequality: “I think there’s a racism we didn’t want to talk about. I heard a young woman, a mother, up in Duluth from Arkansas and she said, ‘The racism I’ve felt has been quieter but meaner.’ And that breaks my heart.” He quoted his lieutenant governor, Peggy Flanagan, the second Native American to be elected to statewide office in U.S. history, noting that “the Minnesota thing” to do when someone raises uncomfortable subjects is, “Well, let’s have pie and turn away from it.”— The budget fallout from the coronavirus pandemic is likely to shadow his entire term in office, and beyond. Walz noted a paradox in which both the coronavirus crisis and the Minneapolis protests have highlighted deep inequalities, especially in education, at precisely the moment when state resources are most scarce. These excerpts have been edited for length and clarity.Has the “One Minnesota” theme that Walz ran on in 2018 been revealed by the George Floyd to be an unattainable idea?That is one where I think I was ahead of where the curve was going. I could feel this brewing. ... I’m a geographer, so I will forever curse the red-blue map people made back in 2000.There is this idea that greater Minnesota is somehow different than the Twin Cities area, and my take was that we were obviously — both as a state and as a nation — stronger together. And so I knew that these tensions were there. I knew that we had to try to heal them, and I ran on that idea and think now more than ever, it’s apparent if we don’t do that, we’re going to get ripped apart. I am not Pollyannaish. There are differences, but this whole idea is that [if the state isn’t unified] we work against our own economic self-interest. The reason Minnesota’s economy is so strong is we have a very vibrant Fortune 500 [base] centered here, which we have to protect. We have a medical device industry that’s the envy of the world. We also are leading producers of pork and turkeys and so those things benefit all of us, and so I think as far as an agenda piece of this, that unifying us together, moving us to an economy that continues to diversify. But one of the issues I really focused on was this education piece. ... I’m a high school teacher, but I spent a lot of time with this, and the thing that was most troubling to me — and this is where the George Floyd stuff [comes in] — is the inequities that America has and kind of the systemic racisms. It's just here, it’s just the absolute epitome. What that ends up causing is you have a state that ranks first in educational attainment in public schools if you’re white, last if you’re not.Minnesota has a divided Legislature — the state Senate is Republican, and the House is Democratic. Walz said his first year of dealing with this split showed some progress.We did something last year that was — again, and you shouldn’t get patted on the back for stuff you’re supposed to do, but — our Legislature did a budget and at that time, we were the only divided Legislature in the country. … The first time in 40 years a governor hadn’t issued a veto and we did that together and there was compromise and I didn’t get [everything I wanted] in education and some of those . The first governor in 20 years that didn’t raise taxes. A Democratic governor, we cut taxes, and those things were kind of working.But Walz said the emergence of Covid-19 — which some initially predicted would transcend partisan divisions — has created a more polarized environment with GOP legislators fearing that Walz would use the crisis to amass power or shut down too much of the economy.Now, Covid has just driven the wedge in this and it’s to me, it’s frustrating because I think there’s legitimate budget discussions to this, but we’re in this place right now … that we couldn’t get a budget done and we couldn’t get our bonding bill done until I give up what every other state governor has; the use of emergency powers to be able to procure PPE and those types of things. They laid down a gauntlet that said, “Unless you give these things up, we’re not doing any of the rest of this.”... I, for one, have said you need to be very careful about the use of those emergency powers, but the president and all 50 states have determined that this pandemic is an emergency. … So I keep asking, “What would you like?” And I think the reality of this is they simply don’t believe that we should be doing anything around Covid. There should be no limitations on restaurants. There should be no mask mandate and we shouldn’t be testing. I’m getting pushback from legislators who are afraid I’m just going to test so I can keep schools closed. I’m a schoolteacher. I’ve got a 13-year-old sitting up there. Trust me, no one in Minnesota wants their kid out of their house and in school more than me, but that’s where we’re at. …I don’t understand it from a political standpoint, but [the pandemic] played into that larger narrative that the other side is not only wrong; they’re bent on destroying something that’s important to you and I don’t know where that got into there. These are my relatives. The county where I grew up [in Nebraska] — and my mom still lives there on a farm — voted 93 percent for President Trump.How has 2020 changed Minnesotans’ view of their state?There’s — even if it’s at a low burn — anxiety still from George Floyd’s death, the fallout of that. And I think trying to understand how Minnesotans see this … there is a Minnesota exceptionalism that we espouse and we think we can back it up with some numbers, but hidden under that, which we all knew, were those achievements gaps, those racial gaps. Not that different than the rest of the country, but probably more exacerbated here. …We’re at the point now and I was at the point before George Floyd, but now that sense of urgency is there. We can no longer avoid that and they are wanting systemic fundamental change and I think that’s what you’re hearing and obviously the horrificness and the lack of humanity that went into the murder of George Floyd was one thing, but I think what you need to recognize — Minnesotans, maybe even more so than other places, especially Black Minnesotans and those who care about this — that pent up desire, we pushed a lot of this under the rug too long, and I think this is what you’re getting. …We envisioned ourselves as progressive, Scandinavian leaders and [yet] we left people behind and we left some communities of color behind, but I think [Trump] also capitalized that we had areas that were heavily dependent on industries that are going away, much like in Appalachia with the coal with some of the mining and the changes that are coming around.The POLITICO interview took place on Aug. 31. Two days earlier, Minneapolis had more protests, and some late-night rioting in defiance of curfews, after a Black man died in a police incident. It was not immediately clear that he had died by suicide rather than from police shooting. As he had done previously, Walz activated National Guard units under his command. He described his style for keeping abreast of events amid so much tension and the constant prospect of more unrest.I did not hear originally of the initial incident at 2 or so. It was the homicide, and the eventual suicide. But by about 5 in the afternoon or so, we started hearing a few things. The mayor of Minneapolis, Mayor [Jacob] Frey, contacted us a little before 7. So we’re checking … and I’m asking them what’s going on with this and then we all got together just shortly after 7. … What I learned from [the George Floyd protests in] May is how quickly these things can escalate. Social media helped spread that and the pain and the anger that was there mixes very quickly with lawlessness and those things and so we started immediately right then moving in our assets, the state patrol, and activation of the National Guard. …They give me the assessment of how many they think they need based on what we think is coming and those things start to go and then we’re up all night and we were on Wednesday night getting the updates as that started to play out and then planning for Thursday. The same thing last night. I was down at the State Emergency Operation Center until roughly 10 or so last night when it seemed like we had that. But a lot of flow of information through my agencies. This is a really unique situation where cities are responsible — primary responsibility for that security — but we saw that no city could have handled what Minneapolis saw those last few days of May and so we kind of had to rethink how do these relationships work, how do we talk about these mutual aid agreements and what is the state’s role?Those commanders — whether they’re the police commanders, the state patrol, or the National Guard — are making those [decisions] in the moment. They’re moving assets from street to street or whatever. It’s my responsibility if we’re going to activate more [National Guard]. ... If we’re going to need more or if that communication is not happening. One of the things we saw in May is being able to communicate and what the states really can do and where there was a big gap was fire suppression and that ended up causing a lot of the problems. And so those were decisions where we had those assets on standby and then they call me and … I say, “Yes, let’s move them. Let’s activate them and move them.”How has the pandemic affected Minnesota finances?Yeah, there’s a very real economic hit that we’re all seeing and obviously states can’t deficit spend. The good news was … we had a rainy-day fund that was proportionally as big as any state in the country. We still — even after Covid and even after our budget projections show about $4.7 billion deficit in the coming biennium. We still have AAA bond ratings. The fundamentals are still strong. One of the reasons is a fairly diversified economy, but it is going to make us think about how we make those investments, and I worry that these are the times when people turn to austerity and the very programs we need to close those gaps are going to take us investing.How will he resolve this tension?I think public-private partnerships that we’re really working on. I, as a public school teacher, believe [education] is foundational to our opportunities, but I also recognize that if we’re failing, we need to be thinking about that.How long will political leaders in states and nationally be dealing with the long-term fallout of the pandemic?That’s an interesting question. I can’t see it in — I would have to say during my lifetime you’ll still be thinking about what this meant and how it rearranged things. And again, I would argue, [he and leaders in both parties] had a pretty good working relationship — not Pollyannaish, again — in a very polarized environment. I was very proud to say we passed a bipartisan budget together. ...[Since the pandemic], now, the narrative is every business that’s not functioning, that’s my fault that I closed them down. Now, I don’t turn around and say, “Well, projections would have showed this many people are dead so if I’d have listened to you, we would have got that many people killed.” I don’t think that’s helpful but that is a narrative. So I think the politics where the One Minnesota is going to be a little harder work. We still have that. I’m very fearful. I saw this as a member of Congress. The danger of that pure polarization. … That’s it, and I worry here that same thing.",
    "In 1968, RFK showed there was a way to respect protesters and reassure voters he was serious about law and order.A specter is haunting Democrats—the specter of a Donald Trump victory in November fueled by suburban voters drawn to his promise of law and order. The polls tell one story—an ABC News survey shows voters give Joe Biden much higher marks than Trump on keeping the country and their family safe, on dealing with protests, on unifying the country. But, as POLITICO noted on Sunday, Democratic strategists are starting to pick up faint but disturbing signs that college-educated suburbanites are beginning to feel concern about their neighborhoods and the value of their homes—classic signs of a “retreat to safety” sentiment that would pose a clear and present danger to the Biden campaign.How much of this concern is well-founded? How much is unjustified panic on the part of what Biden’s team dismiss as “bed-wetters”? And, more to the point: Are there steps the Biden-Harris ticket can take, beyond the explicit condemnations of lawlessness, that could effectively assuage these concerns? The answer requires a look back into political history to a presidential campaign in which “law and order” was a dominant issue. But the most appealing message from a candidate was neither an authoritarian crackdown nor universal tolerance for protesters. 1968 was a year when disorder of every sort was a dominant presence. Nationally, violent crime had doubled since 1960. Racial upheaval had scarred the preceding three years: 34 dead in the Watts riots of 1965; 26 dead in Newark in 1967; 43 dead in Detroit that same year. In the spring of 1968, after the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., 125 cities erupted in violence, with 46 dead and thousands injured. The steps of the U.S. Capitol were ringed with sandbags and gun emplacements manned by troops from the 82nd Airborne Division. On college campuses, the year saw three students in Orangeburg, South Carolina, killed by highway patrol officers; two months later, police cleared protesters out of Columbia University buildings, injuring more than 100. Add this to the frustration over a Vietnam War that was taking more than 500 American lives a week, and the sense that events were spinning out of control was palpable. There was no doubt that this sense of lost control, of chaos, was going to be a major issue in the presidential campaign. What’s striking is how differently the three most dominant candidates in the early going met that issue.For Alabama Governor George Wallace, running as an independent, the answer was as obvious as a mailed fist. Just as his solution to Vietnam was an overwhelming use of force, so was his answer to violence at home. Let the Alabama National Guardsmen deal with it, he said, they’d clean it up in a day or two. It was the elites, he said, living in doorman apartments and gated neighborhoods, who encouraged the protesters and protected the criminals. While Wallace’s electoral strength was clearly in the South, he had shown in 1964 that his appeal was broader, as he racked up significant votes in three Democratic primaries in Indiana, Maryland and Wisconsin.For Richard Nixon, the message was subtler. He would be the experienced hand who could address what one of his advertising team members described as “an uneasiness in the land, a feeling that things aren’t right, that we’re moving in the wrong direction.” From his first congressional campaign in 1946, Nixon had campaigned as the face of the “forgotten Americans, the people who paid the bills, did the work, just wanted a safe home and a good school for their kids.” As Robert Kennedy’s campaign (on which I was a junior speechwriter) drove through Indiana, we kept seeing billboards with Nixon posed alongside a briefcase, with the slogan “Feel Safer With Nixon.” His major ad, featuring footage of riots and fires, was careful to distinguish between legitimate protest and lawlessness, but emphasized that the right to an orderly society was “the first civil right.”And then there was Robert Kennedy.By 1968, he had become a tribune for Black and brown America. He had spoken in increasingly passionate terms about poverty and discrimination. He had identified with student protesters in a 1966 speech when he repeatedly said: “we dissent … ” He had called the inner-city riots, “a cry for love.” But Kennedy, part of a family whose support was rooted in working-class politics, was acutely aware of the power of law and order. As a New York senator, he’d seen a proposal for a civilian police review board go down to massive defeat. He’d seen the toxic mix of race and crime empower politicians in Boston, Newark and Philadelphia. He was determined not to cede the issue to the right. His campaign speeches declared that “we can’t have summer after summer of lawlessness.” He reminded audiences not that he’d been attorney general, but that he’d been “the chief law enforcement officer of the United States.” In the Indiana primary, he campaigned as vigorously in the white working-class neighborhoods of Gary and Hammond as in Black neighborhoods.He took some heat for this. The New York Times editorial board chastised him for moving to the right. Ronald Reagan and Nixon each noted that he was sounding more like them (although their speeches somehow left out the part where RFK talked about endemic poverty and a massive jobs program). But reporters began to notice an odd phenomenon: The same audiences who spoke about cracking down on demonstrators and who expressed admiration for Wallace also said they were considering voting for Kennedy.Why? Because, the answer came back, “He’s tough. He put crooks in jail.” Indeed, as researchers later learned, a considerable number of voters who went for RFK in the May Indiana primary wound up voting for Wallace in November. It turned out that what they were looking for was someone who could end the chaos; whether that was achieved by police state tactics or an ambitious effort to deal with racial injustice was a secondary matter.Whether Kennedy could have won over enough Wallace voters to win the White House had he been nominated, we will never know. We do know that after his death in June a majority of voters turned away from the Democratic nominee, Vice President Hubert Humphrey—who challenged Nixon for calling for a doubling of the rate of convictions and building more jails—to those with sterner messages. Nixon and Wallace shared 57 percent of the popular vote in 1968, and a combined total of 347 electoral votes.Of course, there are immense differences between 1968 and now. Until this spring’s spike in shootings and homicides, the nation’s violent crime rate was at a historic low. New York City, which reached a high of more than 2,200 homicides in 1990, had 350 last year. The unrest following the killing of George Floyd is nowhere near as widespread and fatal as the disorder of the late 1960s. The country is far more sympathetic to the cause of Black Lives Matter than it was even to the nonviolent campaigns of MLK, who was seen by a heavy plurality of Americans as doing more harm than good up until his death, according to a Harris poll taken early that year.And while Nixon was running as the challenger back then, Donald Trump is the president, whose capacity to deal with the unrest has so far been found wanting.But that does not mean there is no potential for a change in the political climate—especially if a key slice of voters comes to believe Trump’s assertion that Biden and Kamala Harris would be unable to control the most violent of the street protesters. Yes, they have been explicit in saying that looting and burning are crimes that could be prosecuted. But at least among some of their most ardent supporters, there is a measure of denial about what is happening. On Twitter, there has been a stream of pictures showing peaceful neighborhoods in Portland, Minneapolis and Kenosha, as if those pictures somehow erase the evidence of significant destruction elsewhere in those cities. There are citations of a study that showed 93 percent of protests were peaceful—which is hardly reassuring to the dozens, or hundreds of families who have had their work and their futures ruined by the remaining 7 percent of protests. Among some of Biden’s media allies there’s been an attempt to downplay what has happened—most memorably in that screen capture of a CNN reporter standing in front of a burning building as the chyron reads: “Fiery but mostly peaceful protests.”What would help is for Biden and Harris to identify the victims of destruction—many of whom are Black or brown or immigrant small-business owners—as other victims, and to assert that they deserve protection even as the work goes on in dealing with the police tactics that wound and kill people of color. (Harris took a significant step in this direction during her visit to Wisconsin on Labor Day.) They can make the point that the journey from marches to civil disobedience does not extend into setting buildings on fire or looting stores … and that the issue is not a matter of political impact, but of simple right and wrong. (Harris might even mention that as prosecutor, her job included dispensing equal justice, protecting the rights of the accused and putting dangerous criminals away.) They might even note the absolute indefensibility of a book like the recently released “In Defense of Looting.” And they can certainly call out Trump for inflaming the worst instincts of his most zealous supporters, leading to violent clashes at protest sites.None of these steps would undermine Biden’s determination to act as a healer, to reject Trump’s increasingly outright racist appeals to his base. Indeed, Biden’s record on civil rights gives him the same space as RFK had in 1968—or that anti-communist crusader Nixon had in 1972 to go to China—to rebut Trump’s attempt to paint him as a puppet of antifa.The key for Biden is to take to heart the lesson of history: You can be a “law and order” candidate without embracing the language of divisiveness or the tactics of a police state. What voters want to know is that you take their concerns seriously, that you neither exacerbate legitimate fears nor minimize them. And if elements of the Twitterverse assail you for acknowledging such concerns, well, that’s a price well worth paying.",
    "Some Trump supporters have taken it upon themselves to police cities experiencing unrest. And Trump isn't condemning the behavior as he pushes a law-and-order election message.A take-to-the-streets MAGA movement that started online has become a reality, egged on by the oblique encouragement of President Donald Trump and little pushback from conservative leaders.It’s a call to arms that has been bubbling online for weeks amid nationwide racial justice protests, circulating among white nationalist-affiliated groups and in local Facebook groups. Armed vigilantes have begun showing up, saying they were there to defend property and arguing Democrats had let lawlessness reign in the streets.But the recent violent clashes in Portland and Kenosha, Wis., represent a turning point in the effort. In Portland, Trump supporters showed up as counterprotesters, and one of them ended up shot and killed. In Kenosha — where 17-year-old Kyle Rittenhouse was charged with killing two people — the clashes came to a smaller city, one that bridges the divide between major urban centers and suburban America.It’s a development Trump and his team have latched onto as they try to win back much-needed suburban voters with a law-and-order message. Trump has branded the racial justice protesters “domestic terror,” praised the Trump-supporting counterprotesters, defended Rittenhouse’s actions and traveled to Kenosha on Tuesday to misleadingly take credit for stopping violence in the city and other urban areas. “It’s all Democrat, everything is Democrat, all of these problems are Democratic cities,” he told reporters during his tour.The rhetoric is part of Trump’s two-track messaging as he heads into the final few months of the campaign. To his supporters, it’s an implication: I won’t condemn you if you show up. And to suburban voters, it’s a proclamation: The states have abdicated their duties, and only I can fix the violence that’s creeping closer.“It is certainly true that there are plenty of conservatives who are growing ever more impatient with both Democrat-elected officials, who typically are at the state and local levels, and also with President Trump,” said Scott Walter, the president of the conservative-leaning Capital Research Center. “Because some of them see him as not acting as forcefully as he should.”Since the resurgence of Black Lives Matter protests this year, Trump and his allies have ramped up not just their rhetoric about alleged lawlessness, looting and riots pervading American cities like Chicago, Seattle and Portland, but their actions as well, criticizing cities for rebuffing Trump’s overtures to deploy federal officials.Trump’s offers have varied, from tweeting that he wanted to send federal forces into Seattle to dismantle the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone, several square city blocks that were being occupied by anti-police demonstrators, to blasting Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot for supposedly resisting his help in policing gun violence in her city.But some of Trump’s supporters have also taken it upon themselves to police these cities.Though the narrative of American cities being overrun with violence has percolated through conservative media, it’s picked up in the past few years as anti-Trump, pro-BLM, and anti-police protests have snowballed. Scenes of looting, vandalism and property destruction only bolstered this worldview, and last year, right-wing extremists started clashing with antifa groups in Portland.But after the killing of George Floyd in May, racial justice protests exploded across the country, with occasional instances of looting and vandalism. These destructive moments turbocharged the far-right calls to proactively defend private property that was being targeted.While extremely few high-profile voices openly called for people to take to the streets and push back against protesters, there was an undercurrent of approval for those who did. Several videos emerged on the internet of police officers across the country chatting amiably with far-right militia members, often armed, during racial justice protests. Members of the Proud Boys, the main far-right group that brawled with antifa protesters in Portland last year, were spotted mingling with police union audience members during an appearance by Vice President Mike Pence earlier this summer.And the St. Louis couple who went viral after a photo emerged of them waving guns at BLM protesters outside their house soon became MAGA superstars, getting a speaking slot at the Republican National Convention last week.“How shocked are we that 17-year-olds with rifles decided they had to maintain order when no one else would?” Fox News host Tucker Carlson told his millions of viewers last week. His colleague Laura Ingraham on Tuesday asked why people were rushing to vilify Rittenhouse for exercising his “God-given right” to defend himself.“If that’s the case, we are going to be in for a really, really long and protracted period of complete chaos and destruction which I don’t think the American people want,” she added.From the beginning of the summer of protests, Trump, who won the endorsements of numerous law enforcement unions and interest groups in 2016, quickly embraced the protests as a culture wars issue, saying the words Black Lives Matter were a “symbol of hate” and calling racial justice protesters “looters” and “anarchists.” He has also accused Democratic rival Joe Biden of leading a party hellbent on destroying “LAW & ORDER” throughout the country.And Trump’s refusal to condemn Rittenhouse, or to stop armed right-wing militia members from traveling to cities seeking out fights with BLM protesters, has only encouraged his fans.The situation came to a head recently in Portland and Kenosha.In Portland, the home of months of clashes between law enforcement and local protesters, an avowed antifa supporter allegedly shot and killed a member of Patriot Prayer, an independent group that had descended in a miles-long caravan on the city over the weekend in an attempt to show support for law enforcement and the president. On Thursday night, police shot and killed the primary suspect in that shooting as they attempted to arrest him.And in Kenosha, there has been a rise of ad hoc, questionably legal militia groups such as the Kenosha Guard, a Facebook group heavily criticized for posting a “call to arms” against protesters on its page just days before the Rittenhouse shooting. In an interview with Kenosha News last Thursday, the group’s leader, Kevin Mathewson, stood by his belief that the “failure from local leaders” to secure their neighborhoods prompted him to make the post.“This is what the Second Amendment was written for,” said Jack Posobiec, a pro-Trump correspondent with One America News Network and far-right internet personality. “We are at war in Kenosha. We are under siege. We are under attack. When law enforcement is outnumbered, that’s when citizens have the right to take up arms to defend their lives, their homes and their businesses.”People have also been traveling into the city. The Justice Department on Thursday charged two Missouri men, Michael Karmo and Cody Smith, with firearms offenses after they were arrested with a massive cache of weapons. The pair allegedly went to the city to see Trump during a trip there Tuesday and “to see proof of the rioting,” according to a DOJ filing. Karmo also allegedly told a witness that he was going to possibly use the firearms on people in Kenosha.Conservatives say unrest in Kenosha — a small Midwestern city with less than 100,000 residents — is likely to resonate more profoundly with suburbanites.Posobiec pointed out that suburbanites had more affinity with their nearby mid-sized cities and, thus, would feel a stronger impact when seeing protests and property destruction in their own backyard.“People move to the suburbs because they like living in a quieter area, but they also like to be close to an urban area, because they can then use that for work or going out shopping for entertainment, etc. And so they do feel a sense of connection to that urban area,” he said. “I can't speak for the people of Kenosha or that surrounding area, but I understand the mentality of somebody living in the suburbs of Kenosha wanting to defend Kenosha from riots.”At this point, Walter said, the racial aspect of the BLM movement might not even play into the criticism of protesters anymore, pointing out that Trump seemed to have lost little support among Black voters.“Probably that’s because some portion of Black folks who live in these places that are already harmed, or in danger of getting harmed, are getting disturbed,” he claimed.A Quinnipiac poll released Wednesday showed Trump had 11 percent support among Black voters — slightly higher than the 7 percent he’d polled at in July.Trump’s push to peg the violence to Democratic policy failures will likely continue into the final leg of the election — and absent a sustained campaign to condemn militia action, there is no impetus for his militia supporters to stop infiltrating American cities, either.“It’s just crazy to think this is going on in the heartland,” said Posobiec. “If we're talking about Main Street, this is Main Street, USA being set on fire, and a political stalemate, and law enforcement at all levels wasn't responding.”",
    "The other side may have lost its mind. But are you sure you aren't losing yours?Someday years from now, Kamala Harris declared in her Democratic convention address, children and grandchildren will look back on Donald Trump’s presidency with a bracing question for the people who lived through it: “Where were you when the stakes were so high?”There surely will be some good stories to tell:“By day, I was an ordinary shopkeeper. By night, my comrades and I donned camouflage and planted bombs under railroad trestles to disrupt the supply of makeup and hairspray heading to the White House and Fox News studios.”Or maybe:“I had an affair with a senior Trump White House official. I pretended to love her even as I inwardly recoiled at her icy touch. Each night I delivered the secrets I learned by carrier pigeon to leaders of The Resistance.”Among most Democrats and a notable number of Republicans, it is now a prevailing notion that the general election ahead represents an existential moment for American democracy. Not just Harris, but Joe Biden and, especially, former President Barack Obama painted the choice in precisely these terms.But if the character of Trump resistance is different than historic resistance movements that is because the Trump threat is likewise of a different character. It arrives at a time when nearly every dimension of daily life reflects how we live in an Age of Small. We fight a virus that is invisible to the naked eye. We communicate with one another most often in bursts of sentence fragments by text and Twitter.Even those who answer Obama’s urgent summons—“Don’t let them take away your democracy”—will join a movement that for the most part exists in an agitated digital space that hardly has a tactile dimension. It will be hard to evoke any retrospective romance of the sort associated with the French Resistance in World War II or the anti-fascists of the Spanish Civil War, as memorialized in the literature or Hemingway and Orwell. Until this summer, when several cities erupted in anger over George Floyd, the Trump Resistance has lacked the brutal physicality of the civil rights movement, when protesters regularly faced the batons of police officers and sometimes the guns and nooses of Klansman.Even now, for the vast majority of people who oppose Trump, the honest answer those children and grandchildren who ask “where were you” when constitutional democracy was on the line will be something like: “I was on my couch compulsively watching cable and checking social media, by turns indignant and depressed.”“I was on the driveway storming out of a holiday gathering after I just couldn’t listen to my uncle spout his Trump B.S. any longer.“At the dinner table we would play those videos by that funny woman, what’s her name, Sarah something? ... Yes, that’s it, Cooper.”The point is not to trivialize Obama’s dire warnings, or to argue that the threat he describes to historic norms of governance is illusory. But the gap between drastic language about the peril represented by Trump and the banal housebound way that all but the most energized activists are experiencing the moment illuminates a point about both the Trump and anti-Trump movements.Both movements are in part ideological but more profoundly psychological. They are driven by people who find the era fundamentally disorienting, who not only hold the other side’s political leaders in contempt but are aghast that fellow citizens somehow are in the grip of an alternate reality.The reason Obama can credibly warn the anti-Trump movement that democracy is on the line does not have to do with midnight knocks on the door, imprisonment or murder of journalists or opposition party leaders, unchecked surveillance as an instrument of political control. These things are happening—at an accelerating pace—all over the world, but not here. On concrete questions of law, George W. Bush’s terror policies arguably represented a more fundamental challenge than Trump tenure has to once-settled questions of civil liberties and the relationship of the individual to state power.The reason Trump is to many people the more profound threat is that he has eviscerated everyone’s sense of normal, of the shared conviction that “that’s just not how things are done in America.” High-level intervention in criminal investigations in which Trump has a political interest, pardons for cronies, firings of inspectors general, profiting off government business at Trump properties—these are the most prominent examples.But, so, too, is just about any day picked at random. Just this week, Trump in an interview claimed he has knowledge of an airplane headed to Washington “almost completely loaded with thugs, wearing these dark uniforms, black uniforms, with gear and this and that” hoping to disrupt his virtual convention week; Asserted that Biden is taking a drug—“some kind of enhancement”—to help with allegedly failing mental acuity; and one of his campaign spokesmen in a television appearance said Kyle Rittenhouse, charged with first-degree murder of protesters in Kenosha, Wis., was practicing understandable vigilante justice: “If you don’t allow police to do their job, then the American people have to defend themselves some way.”Yes, all these comments—and dozens of others—raced across social media and cable as uproars. But under the previous 44 presidencies, any one of these moments naturally would have been so breathtaking that it would have dominated news coverage for months, and effectively brought the presidency to a standstill.If democracy requires some shared sense of normal—of what is in bounds and what is not—there is no question that Trump is so far winning the psychological war on democracy. The most striking result of a USA Today/Suffolk University poll this week was the finding that 28 percent of Biden supporters say they aren't prepared to accept a Trump victory as fairly won. Nineteen percent of Trump backers say “they aren't prepared to accept a Biden victory as legitimate,” the USA Today story said.This result isn’t because of government jackboots. It is because of a degraded political culture in which people do not believe—have no reason to disbelieve—that basic institutions and rituals of democracy are on the level.I’m typically a bit skeptical of journalists or political activists who portray themselves—in a U.S. domestic political context—as fighting heroically on the barricades of freedom. It seems frivolous for people who move freely between home and television studio, often while promoting books or other lucrative projects, to compare themselves with people who genuinely are at risk of jail or torture or summary execution in other countries.Increasingly, though, it seems clear that physical peril isn’t the only kind of threat to democracy. The psychological kind matters, too.Is hurling obscenities at the television screen or trading mocking videos of Trump an expression of a robust democratic culture at work? That seems likely to me. Or is it what people do when they worry that culture is potentially eroding beyond repair?The latter is the scenario Obama warned about. Let’s hope, years from now, his words sound a bit overexcited. We will be in trouble if they sound prescient.",
    "“People choke under those circumstances, and they make a bad decision,” the president said.President Donald Trump on Monday likened police officers who commit acts of brutality to golfers who “choke” and miss a 3-foot putt, resisting the real-time efforts of a conservative cable news ally to steer him away from the comparison.The remarks from the president came in an interview with Fox News’ Laura Ingraham, during which Trump lamented how law enforcement officers are “under siege” in the United States amid new scrutiny of racial injustice in policing.“They can do 10,000 great acts, which is what they do, and one bad apple or a choker — you know, a choker. They choke,” Trump said, apparently making reference to the shooting of Jacob Blake by police in Kenosha, Wis.Blake, a 29-year-old Black man, was shot in the back seven times by a white police officer on Aug. 23 as he leaned into his car. Three of Blake’s children were reportedly in the back seat of his SUV when their father was shot. Blake survived the shooting, but family members have said he is paralyzed from the waist down.“Shooting the guy in the back many times. I mean, couldn’t you have done something different? Couldn’t you have wrestled him?” Trump said Monday. “You know, I mean, in the meantime, he might’ve been going for a weapon. And, you know, there’s a whole big thing there.”It was not clear whether Trump was specifically discussing Blake’s shooting or advancing unfounded speculation about the role of a weapon in that case. The Wisconsin Department of Justice reported last week that its investigators “recovered a knife from the driver’s side floorboard” in Blake’s vehicle. But law enforcement have not said the knife or any other weapon was used in Blake’s encounter with police. Nevertheless, Trump proceeded Monday to say of police officers: “They choke just like in a golf tournament. They miss a 3-foot putt.”It was then that Ingraham interjected, telling the president: “You’re not comparing it to golf, because of course that’s what the media would say.”“I’m saying people choke. People choke,” Trump responded. “And people are bad people. You have both. You have some bad people and you have — they choke.”Trump’s comments are in keeping with other broad defenses of law enforcement he has issued this summer as the country has struggled with a racial reckoning sparked by the killing of George Floyd by Minneapolis police in May. “We must remember that the overwhelming majority of police officers in this country — and that’s the overwhelming majority — are noble, courageous, and honorable,” Trump said in his Republican National Convention acceptance speech last week. “We have to give law enforcement, our police, back their power.”The president echoed that rhetoric Monday, expressing sympathy for long-tenured police who respond disproportionately to perceived threats when they have a “quarter-of-a-second to make a decision.”“If you don’t make the decision, and you’re wrong, you’re dead. People choke under those circumstances, and they make a bad decision. I’ve seen bad decisions of people that it looked bad, but probably it was a choke,” Trump said. “But you also have bad police,” he added. “But you also — the vast, not only the vast majority — thousands and thousands of great acts and one bad one, and you make the evening news for weeks.”",
    "Republicans say more chaos and violence are in store if Joe Biden is elected, while Democrats say what’s happening is “Donald Trump’s America.”After a fatal shooting in Portland, Ore., allies of President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden on Sunday sought to attribute the violence and chaos occurring amid protests across the country to the opposing candidate.Republicans framed the disorder surrounding demonstrations against police brutality and racial injustice as a harbinger of what would come should Biden win the White House in November. Democrats drove home the point that what’s happening on the ground is a direct result of who’s already in the White House.“The chaos and the disorder and the lawlessness that we are currently seeing, that’s Donald Trump’s America,” Rep. Val Demings (D-Fla.) said on CBS’ “Face the Nation.”At least a half-dozen Democrats appeared across the spectrum of Sunday political talk shows, where they condemned violence, pilloried the president and made clear that he was responsible for what is happening in this country.“We are not safe in Donald Trump’s America,” Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota added on ABC’s “This Week.”White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, however, maintained that it was “just not accurate” to “reframe it that way.”“You know, you want to talk about Donald Trump’s America,” he said in an interview on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” “Most of Donald Trump’s America is peaceful.”A man whose hat bore the insignia of a far-right group called Patriot Prayer was fatally shot late Saturday during a clash between Trump supporters and counter-protesters, capping a violent week in America that began with a white police officer shooting Jacob Blake, a Black man, in the back seven times in Kenosha, Wis., last Sunday. Two days later, a white teenager from Illinois allegedly shot three people in Kenosha, killing two of them.Protests have occurred for more than 90 consecutive days in Portland since George Floyd, another Black man, was killed by the police in Minneapolis in May. Portland police have yet to release details of the man who was killed over the weekend or any information about the suspected gunman.On Sunday afternoon, Portland’s mayor, Ted Wheeler, held a news conference to denounce the violence, pledging that the shooter would be arrested and prosecuted. He asked the community to “pull together in the name of peace and humanity,” and castigated Trump for language and actions that he blamed for sparking conflict.“Do you seriously wonder, Mr. President, why this is the first time in decades that America has seen this level of violence?“ Wheeler said. “It's you who have created the hate and the division. It's you who have not found a way to say the names of Black people killed by police officers, even as people in law enforcement have, and it‘s you who claimed that white supremacists are good people. Your campaign of fear is as anti-democratic as anything you have done to create hate and vitriol in our beautiful country.“Trump for weeks has painted Portland as a city whose leaders can’t control its citizens or prevent protesters from destroying it. The president has sent federal agents there to protect government property and control “anarchists and agitators,” elevating confrontations between protesters and law enforcement as he calls for law and order.That message was widespread at last week’s Republican National Convention, where supporters warned of cities being overrun by violent mobs on the radical left. With the coronavirus pandemic killing more than 180,000 Americans and battering the economy, Republicans are trying to make safety a key campaign issue amid a national reckoning on race relations, driving their message of law and order as Democrats emphasize the need for police reform to halt the killings of unarmed Black people.Trump tweeted on Saturday that “Kenosha has been very quiet” since the National Guard entered the city, indicating the same would be true of Portland if its leaders accepted the administration’s assistance.“Our great National Guard could solve these problems in less than 1 hour,” Trump tweeted on Sunday. “Local authorities must ask before it is too late.”Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf said the administration was waiting for the investigation of the Portland shooting to play out, but he also suggested that the killing pointed to the larger issue of state and local officials “not allowing law enforcement to do their job and really to bring this violent activity night after night after night to a close.”“As you see that continue to unfold over the course of three months, you are going to continue to see violent activity,” Wolf predicted on ABC. The administration is “happy to provide resources to bring this violence to an end, violence that, again, across the ideological spectrum, left or right, the violence needs to end.”Trump will travel to Kenosha on Tuesday to meet with local law enforcement. Lara Trump, the president’s daughter-in-law and a senior campaign adviser, said the president had reached out to Blake’s family, but it is unclear whether they will meet this week.“I’m sure, given the opportunity, he would be more than happy to do that,” she said on “Fox News Sunday.” “But I haven’t gotten that information just yet.”Despite outgoing White House counselor Kellyanne Conway telling Fox News last week that more chaos, anarchy, violence and vandalism were “better” for the president’s campaign, Lara Trump said that violence was “never something any of us would want to see happen.”Recalling what she described as an “anarchist mob” that encircled Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) and his wife outside of the White House after the president’s nomination acceptance speech Thursday, Lara Trump said, “You didn’t see that happening on the other side,” because “that would never happen.”“It only goes one way,” she added.Rep. Karen Bass (D-Calif.), who chairs the Congressional Black Caucus, said Kenosha shouldn’t be used as a way to campaign.“I think his visit has one purpose and one purpose only, and that is to agitate things and to make things worse,” she said on CNN’s “State of the Union.” “What also happened in Portland, too, you saw a parade of Trump supporters actually actively shooting paintballs at peaceful protesters. And the president, in my opinion, encourages that. He actually retweeted the people firing paint guns. So, I think he only means to agitate things. He is campaigning.”Biden, the Democratic presidential nominee, is planning to address the nation this week in a unifying speech that will showcase his leadership, according to his campaign, but it is unclear whether he will travel to Wisconsin.On Sunday afternoon he denounced the Portland shooting and, more broadly, the violence stemming from recent protests. He also called on Trump to take a similar stance.“The deadly violence we saw overnight in Portland is unacceptable,” Biden said in a written statement. “Shooting in the streets of a great American city is unacceptable. I condemn this violence unequivocally. I condemn violence of every kind by any one, whether on the left or the right. And I challenge Donald Trump to do the same.“Biden called for unity and, like his allies, blamed Trump for encouraging division.“We must not become a country at war with ourselves,” Biden said in his statement. “A country that accepts the killing of fellow Americans who do not agree with you. A country that vows vengeance toward one another. But that is the America that President Trump wants us to be, the America he believes we are.“To Conway’s point, recent polling indicates that white suburban voters would feel less safe in a Biden administration, something the Biden campaign rejects.“I think suburban voters are looking around at what’s going on in this country and they’re looking at who’s in the White House and they’re seeing Donald Trump. They don’t see Joe Biden,” Kate Bedingfield, Biden’s deputy campaign manager, said on “Fox News Sunday.” “They see Donald Trump in the White House. This is Trump’s America. The chaos that suburban voters are feeling and that voters all across this country are feeling is a result of Donald Trump’s failed leadership.”Bedingfield also accused Trump of trying to incite violence, and the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), told CNN that Trump was “willfully fanning the flames of this violence.”Trump began his Sunday with a flurry of activity on social media, tweeting, retweeting and quote-tweeting dozens of messages that ran the gamut from bashing Wheeler — siding with a post that referred to him as a “useless f---ing idiot” — to praising the caravan of supporters who drove into Portland over the weekend as “GREAT PATRIOTS” and sharing a satirical news article that quoted Biden talking to a department store mannequin.In the afternoon, the president referred to Wheeler on Twitter as “the dummy running Portland,” and concluded: “The only way you will stop the violence in the high crime Democrat run cities is through strength!“ Earlier in the day, he had retweeted a post that gave Wheeler’s phone number and asked people to call it to tell him to resign.Additional posts that appeared on the president’s timeline suggested that Wheeler should resign “for committing war crimes,” that Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York should be jailed and that Mayor Muriel Bowser of Washington, D.C., should arrest “agitators and thugs!” The president also reissued a call for “LAW & ORDER!!!”“It is quite interesting to listen to President Donald John Trump talk about being the law-and-order president when no one has violated the law in 2020 more than he has,” said Demings, who served as an impeachment manager earlier this year and sits on the House Intelligence and Judiciary panels. “We’re talking about a president who just had his kickoff for his reelection on the grounds of the White House. And we all know that that was a violation of law.”Trump campaigned on a pledge to restore safety, though Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) cautioned, “President Trump has a tendency to overpromise.”Still, Republicans insisted that chaos in Democratic-led cities was the fault of those very Democrats, not the president. Meadows said the Trump administration had repeatedly offered federal assistance to cities, help that was rejected in Portland.“The president is on the side of law enforcement and the rule of law,” Meadows said.Trump on Sunday morning also shared a post predicting that he could win as much as 16 percent of the Black vote, doubling the support he got in 2016.Cedric Richmond (D-La.), a Biden campaign co-chairman, said the president “effectively” raised the question of what Black Americans have to lose by supporting him in 2016. “Black men see clearly what they have to lose,” Richmond said on NBC. “They can get killed and the president won’t say a word, won’t utter Jacob Blake’s name, will not talk about police reform.”“This is his America. So how do you break this country and then run for reelection saying, ‘I want to fix everything that I just destroyed?’” Richmond continued. “And so that will be the message of the campaign, and we’re going to have to make that case. But at the same time, I think America is in a real fragile point and I think that you will hear Joe Biden speak, you will hear him try to heal this country, because the president just doesn’t have it in him.”",
    "Speakers throughout the day emphasized a moderate message at odds with the demands for a more sweeping criminal justice overhaul voiced by many in the crowd.The thousands gathered for the 57th March on Washington on the National Mall on Friday heard civil rights leaders call for policy reform and civic engagement. Though for some, the message from the day’s speakers did not match the urgency of the moment. The disconnect reveals a growing tension between veteran organizers and younger grassroots protesters, one that the civil rights movement has navigated for decades.The event focused on ways to end police violence against African-Americans — a steep challenge that, Rev. Al Sharpton argued, could become a reality in 2020 as a result of this summer’s multi-racial protests against police violence and institutional racism. Those attending the march, which was organized by Sharpton’s National Action Network and Martin Luther King III, expressed a palpable concern about police violence that has not been as visible at previous marches. Many said that incremental reforms would not fix things. Rather, completely rethinking the approach to policing and public safety was necessary — immediately.These more radical ideas were not echoed from the podium. A majority of the day’s speakers focused on working through the existing political systems — via congressional legislation and turning out to vote — to avoid another George Floyd (killed by police) or Jacob Blake (seriously wounded). Their proposals, some argued, aren’t enough to solve large, complex issues like criminal justice reform and systemic racism. Polling shows that even across races, there is a divide between age groups about how to respond to this iteration of the movement. “We’re tired of hearing about reform. We’re tired of hearing that something will change and it doesn’t,” said Zayhna Woodson, a college-aged attendee who traveled with nearly a dozen members of her family to the march from Lansing, Mich. To her, voting mattered more on the state and local levels because they were changes she felt she had real control over.“I feel like the system, no matter what we do, how we vote, at the top — it doesn’t matter. It needs to be abolished and made into something new. Because what we have right now is not working. They say, ‘left-wing’, ‘right-wing’, it’s all the same bird.”“To a certain extent, you’ve always got that energy,” explained Cliff Albright, co-founder of Black Voters Matter. Albright argued that the march’s timing didn’t match the needs of the moment, saying that hosting a national gathering like Sharpton’s could alienate younger grassroots activists who’ve spent months organizing protests and other direct action. “A lot of times what winds up happening is that there's just kind of simmering tensions and these feelings of a lack of respect and feelings that your methods aren't really being supported,” Albright said. Friday’s speakers called for the passage of the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act and John Lewis Voting Rights Act before the 2020 election. Both bills have passed the House but remain in limbo in the Senate.Sharpton and others affiliated with the march maintained that galvanizing the thousands of attendees to push for immediate action on the legislation is a major feat. It is also why the gathering’s full title is the “Get Your Knee Off Our Necks Commitment March,” to underline the grassroots’ role in pushing through sweeping legislative changes.Speakers harkened back to the Civil Rights Act of 1965, which was made possible, in part, by the original March on Washington in 1963. Rep. John Lewis, who died in July, was the last living speaker at that march, which was organized by A. Philip Randolph and Bayard Rustin and featured Martin Luther King Jr.’s “I Have a Dream” speech. Sharpton, who was molded in the same activist tradition, emphasized that organizers hoped to achieve the same kind of policy outcome as the event’s original planners.“This is the time for legislative change,” Sharpton affirmed in his address to the crowd, flanked by Reps. Al Green and Sheila Jackson Lee, two sponsors of the George Floyd Act. “This is the time for us to vote like we’ve never voted before. We want to get rid of anybody that’s in our way. Our parents died for us to vote.” Even as different generations of organizers debate tactics, there remains a sense of community and understanding about the common goals of the movement — and the life-and-death consequences of what it is pushing for. “I think that people are ready to see change now,” said Rep. Green (D-Texas). “They've been waiting for a long time for this moment. And I think they're seizing upon the moment that there's an urgency of now that cannot be escaped.” Perhaps what united the attendees most were the figures who were central to the march: victims of police violence and their families. Kenethia Alston, the mother of Marqueese Alston, who was killed by D.C. police in 2018, said she felt the frequent, high-profile nature of police brutality seen in Floyd’s and Blake’s respective cases will be the ultimate driver of policy success.“The message is not just for continuous symbols of marches but for true change for police brutality cases,” Alston said in an interview. “I believe that there’s been a new, energized revolution towards police brutality and I’m trusting and affirming that that will be true change as it relates to not only George Floyd’s case but Marqueese and others as well.” Marchers flooded the mall with “8:46” t-shirts and masks in recognition of the time Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin spent kneeling on George Floyd’s kneck, killing him. Many carried “say her name” signs in recognition of Breonna Taylor, who was shot and killed by police officers in her own apartment, along with enlarged photos of Elijah McClain, Tamir Rice, Trayvon Martin and others killed at the hands of police or white vigilantes.It begged a single, profound question among many in the crowd: will I or my loved ones be next?“I want to see change for my grandsons,” said Lisa Cabrel, the grandmother of six boys. She and one of her grandsons traveled to the march from Bridgeport, Ct.“I’m scared for him,” she said, referencing her grandson. “I’m scared when he goes to school, I’m scared when he’s outside playing. I’m afraid that the police don’t understand Black childrens’ behavior and their mannerisms so they take everything for a threat and they kill our children. I want to see change for that.”",
    "The BREATHE Act is the centerpiece of the policy agenda activists are pushing after months of demonstrations over racial injustice.After three months of sustained public protest, Black Lives Matter organizers are stepping from streets and plazas into the policy arena. And they’re going big.The BREATHE Act, a four-part proposal named after the phrase uttered by Black men Eric Garner and George Floyd while in police choke holds, aims to codify the movement’s core objective: redirecting federal funds away from police, prisons and other parts of the criminal justice system and into underserved communities of color. “I think that we've demonstrated over time that we have the rigor and the relationships and the expertise to truly generate meaningful ideas into public policy solutions,\" said Jessica Byrd, a Democratic strategist and lead organizer of the Black National Convention, the virtual gathering of activists taking place Friday night. “And the BREATHE Act is the best and highest example of that.”The policy document is set to take center stage at the Black National Convention, which aims to create “a vision for Black Lives before the biggest election of our time, and long after.” While its architects recognize it does not have the necessary backing on Capitol Hill — even in a Democratic-majority House — they argue it’s an important marker for activists as they seek to turn the momentum gained through a summer of protest into political wins. How far they go in building support will be a critical test of the movement’s enduring influence, post-George Floyd. “Certainly, this is a moment politically where I think so many of us are trying to see where the rebellions in the streets will have impact on policy, platform and practice of the major political parties,” said Alicia Garza, a co-founder of Black Lives Matter. “And, you know, for us, I think the BREATHE Act really represents an opportunity to galvanize voters, particularly Black voters, in this election cycle.”The BREATHE Act finds its roots in the 2016 policy platform called the Vision for Black Lives. It was drafted in response to the police killings of African Americans like Michael Brown, Sandra Bland and Philando Castile and called for a similar divest-invest approach to policing and public safety that Byrd said was often rebuffed “as this lofty, unviable set of ideas.” But George Floyd’s death at the hands of a Minneapolis police officer catapulted the discussion over defunding the police into the mainstream and turned Black Lives Matter from a controversial topic into a household phrase. In the latest sign of its cultural significance, athletes across several professional leagues including the NBA, WNBA and MLB this week opted to break their contracts and sit out games and matches in a show of solidarity with anti-racism protesters. The response has convinced Byrd and other organizers that the BREATHE Act also has the potential to go mainstream. She and others involved with the Black National Convention plan to highlight the proposal Friday as an example of the work organizers are doing not just to protest current injustices, but end them.“What we want to tell folks is that in this moment, we are ripe for transformation. And we can build that and achieve that if we come together under a shared political vision that touches on policies around reproductive justice and housing and the criminal legal system which includes policing and the environment,” said Kayla Reed, executive director of the organizing group Action St. Louis and co-founder of the Movement for Black Lives’ Electoral Justice Project. “We don't have to just get one thing done,” Reed continued. “We can get it all done, because it's what our communities deserve.”The BREATHE Act’s terms go beyond criminal justice reform. The plan calls for funding for infrastructure that can withstand climate change-related disasters and federal grants to guarantee clean air and water for all communities. It also supports the passage of H.R. 40, which would establish a committee for the study of reparations; and calls for the expansion of existing health programs like Medicaid under the terms of the Affordable Care Act.There have been some small signs of progress in building support for the proposal, which has yet to be formally introduced in Congress. When the Movement for Black Lives requested a meeting with the Congressional Black Caucus to present the BREATHE Act, Sen. Kamala Harris, stepped up to arrange it. Sen. Cory Booker introduced a sweeping criminal justice reform bill in 2019 that would reduce mandatory minimums for drug offenses, reinstate the right to vote for the formerly incarcerated and expunge records for those with marijuana offenses. And in July, Patrisse Cullors, co-founder of Black Lives Matter, addressed the Democratic National Committee’s platform committee to encourage the party’s top brass to adopt the BREATHE Act as part of its platform. Harris, now the party's vice presidential nominee, has made no further commitment to backing the BREATHE Act, however. And the DNC did not adopt the proposal as part of the party platform, though it did include the phrase “Black lives matter” with the promise to study the impacts of slavery and Jim Crow-era segregation on current racial inequities. Booker’s bill is unlikely to make any progress in the current, Republican-held Senate.Even in the Democrat-controlled House, the legislation is likely to face a frosty reception. Most Democrats in Congress have already rejected the idea of defunding the police. Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden has proposed a $300 million investment in the COPS program, which would hire more police officers and require that their demographics mirror the communities they serve.During a virtual panel hosted by UCLA’s Latino Policy and Politics Initiative in July, CBC Chair Karen Bass told POLITICO that elements of the BREATHE Act are already in existing legislation. However, parts of the sweeping proposal, she said, are “more challenging.”“One of the main points of that bill is that it shows how you can cut federal spending and re-invest in communities and that concept, that principle is something I feel very strongly about,” Bass said. “The wholesale elimination of programs, I think, would be challenging.”The legislation does, however, have the support of prominent progressives Democratic Reps. Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, who plan to co-sponsor it. And organizers see a handful of new allies in young, Black progressives politicians such as New York’s Jamaal Bowman and Missouri’s Cori Bush, whose primary victories this summer all but assure them of seats in Congress in 2021. To some organizers, Bowman and Bush’s election wins, which involved ousting older, moderate Democrats, are an important step forward for the young generation of activists seeking to shape policy at the local, state and federal levels.“I hope that we continue as protesters to go and seek the power [in] Congress and state legislatures and city halls and that we remember the values and principles we wanted the leaders before us to have,” said Clifton Kinnie, a St. Louis-based organizer and founder of Our Destiny STL, a network of young activists in Missouri. “I believe that Cori Bush will not only do that but will do so much more to voice the concerns of the people here. I think this is just the beginning.”Supporters of the proposal also note that despite the public’s reluctance to embrace calls to defund the police, sweeping police reform measures remain popular. A 2019 study conducted by the Black Futures Lab, a think tank led by Garza, found that 85 percent of the more than 30,000 Black respondents desired more police accountability. A plurality of respondents reported having negative interactions with police and a majority were in favor of more investment in Black communities. And polling shows support for reform is also growing outside the Black community: According to a Gallup poll, nearly two-thirds of all Americans support Black Lives Matter protests and nearly half say the demonstrations have altered their views of racial justice.The BREATHE Act, argues Garza, “is actually speaking to the majoritarian values that I think are not only being expressed through these rebellions, but are also being expressed through the ways that people are showing up to participate in cities and states across the country.” “The movement is making impact and the question becomes, how will our elected representatives and those who seek our votes step up to meet this moment?” she added.With this in mind, the goals of the Black National Convention are not only to encourage support of the BREATHE Act, but of Black movement work, writ large. The convention will stream on the evening of the 57th anniversary of the March on Washington and on the heels of another police shooting of a Black man, Jacob Blake, in Kenosha, Wis. Organizers hope that by creating a program where Black communities are front of mind, they can garner the support they need to continue organizing across the country and make possible the changes they’ve been advocating for decades.“This is for everyone who has ever seen the story of someone who lost their lives to police and knew that it was unjust. For someone who maybe came to their first protest this year. It's for the person who hasn't gone out to a protest at all but sees the hashtag or sees the conversation,” Reed explained.“This is not for politicos. This is not for people who are entrenched in partisan politics or party politics. This is for everyday people to understand that our movement is for everyone, that all Black people have the right to be alive and thrive in our communities. And we are fighting for that.”Laura Barrón-López contributed to this report.",
    "The president tried hard to soften his image on race. But can four nights of testimonials make up for four years of stoking racial divisions?Tim Scott waxed about his family arc — \"from cotton to Congress in one lifetime\" — and invoked George Floyd and Breonna Taylor. Nikki Haley spoke of her Indian roots and alluded to her decision to take down the Confederate flag. Herschel Walker said he's seen \"racism up close\" — and it's not Donald Trump.For a president credibly accused of stoking racial fears and divisions throughout his term, Trump, with his choice of speakers, leaned hard into the topic during the first night of his convention on Monday. One Republican after another defended Trump’s record on race, while highlighting Joe Biden's race-related gaffes and history pushing the 1994 crime bill. All told, it was a surprising amount of attention paid to an issue typically associated with Democrats.But even as speakers such as Scott and Haley attempted to soften Trump's image on race — while essentially making the case that the racial justice movement has gone too far in its views of policing — others took a harder-edged tack that undercut the message of inclusion. In an ominous presentation that warned suburbanites that their safety is at risk if Democrats win, Mark and Patricia McCloskey, the couple who pointed guns at Black Lives Matter protesters outside their home in St. Louis, made clear that the president's outreach would go only so far.“What you saw happen to us could just as easily happen to any of you who are watching from quiet neighborhoods around our country,” Patricia McCloskey said. “Make no mistake: No matter where you live, your family will not be safe in the radical Democrats’ America.\"The Republican convention opened amid another round of mass protests over a police shooting of a Black man, this time in Kenosha, Wis. With voters of color backing Biden by staggering margins, most Black speakers downplayed criticisms of Trump poor record on race by recounting their own personal experiences with him.“Growing up in the Deep South, I’ve seen racism up close, I know what it is, and it isn’t Donald Trump,” said Walker, the former NFL player, who said he has known the president for 37 years, when the then-business mogul bought the New Jersey Generals pro football team. Walker said that Trump cares about social justice, and “keeps right on fighting to improve the lives of Black Americans.” Georgia state lawmaker Vernon Jones, a self-proclaimed lifelong Democrat, also vouched for the president and maintained that his support is growing among Black Americans who feel they're not being served by Democratic politicians. “The Democratic Party does not want Black people to leave their mental plantation,” Jones said. \"I have news for Joe Biden: We are free, we are free people with free minds, and I'm part of a large and growing segment of the Black community who are independent thinkers, and we believe that Donald Trump is the president that America needs to lead us forward.\"Republicans pointed to Trump's accomplishments on issues affecting Black Americans, such as increasing funding for historically Black colleges and universities, supporting minority-owned small businesses and signing into law the First Step Act, a criminal justice reform bill pushed by his administration. Polls show Biden with a 75-point lead over Trump among Black voters on average, and Trump is polling at 8 percent among Black voters. But if he can close the gap with Biden even slightly, the president's advisers think it could make the difference in several swing states. Republicans also seized on Biden's gaffes and generalizations on the campaign trail as examples of Democrats' ineptitude. “Joe Biden said if a Black man didn‘t vote for him, he wasn't truly Black. Joe Biden said Black people are a monolithic community. It was Joe Biden who said poor kids can be just as smart as white kids,“ Scott said, before pointing to Biden‘s leading role in crafting the 1994 crime bill, which contributed to mass incarceration. Trump, meanwhile, “signed into law historically high funding for [historically Black colleges and universities], as well as a bill to give them permanent funding for the first time ever,“ Scott said in the final speech of the night. Haley, a fellow South Carolinian who served as governor and the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, also challenged Democrats‘ views on race. “In much of the Democratic Party, it‘s now fashionable to say that America is racist,” she said. “That is a lie. America is not a racist country.” “The American people know we can do better. And of course we value and respect every Black life.“ The Covid-19 election is here and both parties have reimagined their conventions. This week, it's the Republicans' turn. Check out our 2020 national convention page for the latest news, video, live interviews and analysis.Kim Klacik, who is running for the Congress in the Baltimore district long held by civil rights advocate Elijah Cummings, sounded a similar note, saying that the “days of blindly supporting Democrats are coming to an end.” “Joe Biden believes we can’t think for ourselves, that the color of someone’s skin dictates their political views,” Klacik said, condemning Democrats' leadership in Baltimore (a frequent target of Trump).Yet it's far from clear that a four-night convention can counter four years of fodder Trump has provided to critics. Just last week, POLITICO reported on a recording of a private meeting in 2017 at which Trump acknowledged that lower turnout among Black voters benefited him in the2 election. “Many Blacks didn’t go out to vote for Hillary ’cause they liked me,” he told a room of civil rights leaders. “That was almost as good as getting the vote, you know, and it was great.”",
    "Despite repeated talk of structural racism, Black Lives Matter activists want Democrats to \"close the gap between symbolism and substance.\"Joe Biden gave the floor to George Floyd's brothers and Eric Garner’s mother on the first night of his convention. On the third night, Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama spoke the words “Black lives matter,” and Kamala Harris bemoaned the damage done by “structural racism.”The embrace of the movement against racial injustice was a dramatic shift from the party's last convention four years ago and did not go unnoticed by Black Lives Matter activists. But its leaders viewed the gestures as mostly lip service, without a real commitment to policy change: They want Biden to commit to defund the police and to crack down on misconduct by law enforcement.“It’s been unfortunate to not see the Democratic Party fully align themselves with the powerful work this movement has been doing,\" said Patrisse Cullors, who helped found the BLM movement in 2013 after the killing of Trayvon Martin.The disappointment underscores the persistent divide between Biden's campaign and many BLM activists, even as they present a united front to oust President Donald Trump. It also showcases the careful line Democrats are attempting to walk: While the BLM movement has gone mainstream, most Americans tell pollsters they don’t support withholding money for police. Biden is trying to straddle the demands of the movement without alienating swing voters. He spoke about the “stain of racism” in his nomination address without offering policy prescriptions. Though Biden likely stands to benefit politically from the seismic shift in support for Black Lives Matter, he kept the most activist element of the movement at bay during the four-day convention — even as he highlighted Republican politicians supporting him for president. Biden’s campaign worked with progressives on police reform in the weeks leading up to the convention. On the first night, the virtual gathering focused on racial injustice, featuring a roundtable with the nominee on police violence and speeches on racism and inequality from Washington, D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser and House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn. But many of the figures chosen to address systemic racism are the same politicians being targeted by the movement with pressure campaigns. “It took seven years for Democrats to articulate that Black lives matter. Now, the country is watching to see if and how they will close the gap between symbolism and substance,\" said Alicia Garza, another co-founder of the BLM movement and head of the voter engagement group Black Futures Lab. Garza and other movement leaders pointed to Democrats’ rejection of language aimed at limiting police abuses that activists pitched for the party’s platform. And the Biden campaign’s calls to “rein in” qualified immunity — which gives cops legal protections against civil suits brought by victims’ families for misconduct — have left many activists wondering what exactly he's proposing.Monifa Bandele, a leader in the Movement for Black Lives coalition, a coalition of more than 150 Black-led organizations, said she was heartened by the inclusion of Gwen Carr, the mother of Eric Garner, in Monday’s lineup. Garner was killed by police in 2014. Bandele said the party should listen closely to Carr’s pleas for national legislation on police brutality.“Don't just give [Carr] the microphone, make sure that what she says on the microphone translates to a written commitment by the party,” Bandele said. “You can have a lot of talking heads at a convention saying a lot of great things, but unless you put it down on paper that these are the issues that we commit to addressing, moving forward with the new administration, then it's performative.” Activists are reacting to what they see as Biden’s election strategy: embracing the larger goal of the BLM movement while courting swing white voters who want to address racial injustice but don’t think defunding the police is the answer. “I may be kidding myself but I think the people are ready” for change, Biden said during the racial justice roundtable. Though Biden’s approach irks progressives — many bristled when he said “most cops are good” — it also frustrates the right. Trump’s campaign has simultaneously tried to cast Biden as a tool of the left whose administration would defund police, and a tough-on-crime politician who hasn’t changed his ways. “I don't expect him to suddenly sound like a member of ‘The Squad,’” said progressive Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii), referring to the group of firebrand House liberals that includes Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. “I expect him to build coalitions, listen, and get progressive change done. But if someone's expecting him to turn into Bernie Sanders, that's not going to happen.”Schatz said Biden’s creation of “unity” task forces with Bernie Sanders as a way of bridging policy differences with progressives was “very senatorial” — using bipartisan techniques to collaborate with opposing forces in the party.“Joe Biden is very effective at advancing the ball, but not feeling the need to fall into or even jump over every trap,\" Schatz added. In one critical battleground state, Pennsylvania, Democratic operatives said Biden’s support of the BLM movement and statement at the convention that “most cops are good” made sense politically. Internal polling shows Black Lives Matter and the Fraternal Order of Police are both popular in the swing state, but defunding the police is not, said a Democratic strategist based there.Symone Sanders, a senior adviser to Biden, said the campaign is listening to activists but pushed back on the criticism that the party was insincere in its approach. “I don't think George Floyd's brother, Philonise, thought that it was performative that he was participating in the Democratic National Convention, not a couple months after the horrific killing of his brother,” Sanders said in an interview.Still, Cullors, a longtime leader in the movement, clashed with Biden’s campaign while Democrats were drafting the party's platform. Biden's team told Bernie Sanders’ aides they wanted Cullors to withdraw amendments to the platform that she introduced supporting the BREATHE Act, according to Cullors and other people familiar with the deliberations. The proposal would eliminate federal programs that are \"used to finance and expand\" law enforcement. As a compromise, she was offered the opportunity to give a speech instead, which she did.\"I don't think any of it was acceptable,\" Cullors said of the trade-off. \"Every single amendment was turned down.\"In the speech at a meeting of the convention’s platform committee, she laced into the Democratic establishment, asking, “Can any of you here truly stand up and say, 'My party is the party of principles'?\"During the convention, the Movement for Black Lives Electoral Justice Project released an open letter to the Democratic National Committee, which it said was signed by 10,000 people, calling on it to support the BREATHE Act and defunding police. At the same time, Cullors and other Black Lives Matter leaders praised the Democratic convention for showcasing diverse speakers and highlighting racial justice, and said they will work to elect Biden.Progressives and BLM organizers have also questioned Biden’s position on qualified immunity, a rule supported by police unions that shields cops from misconduct lawsuits. The Biden campaign has said repeatedly he supports “reining in” qualified immunity, but provided few specifics on what that would look like. By contrast, the Justice in Policing Act passed by the House and co-led by Biden’s vice presidential nominee Harris, would end qualified immunity. A recent Pew Research poll found two-thirds of Americans effectively want to do away with the doctrine.Sanders’ appointees sought to abolish the rule when negotiating criminal justice reforms with Biden’s camp on the unity task forces. Biden, who backs decriminalization of marijuana, has also resisted calls from progressives and moderates to legalize it.“Those are the reforms we were demanding a decade ago,” said Bandele, senior vice president of mothers’ advocacy organization MomsRising. “2020 demands more. Reining it in, I don’t even know what that means.” Symone Sanders defended Biden’s position on qualified immunity as an “intentional and thoughtful one.” She said Biden’s views on the topic differ from the provisions in the Justice in Policing Act, which the campaign considers “just a start.” Biden has applauded some aspects of the legislation.“There are a number of things in that bill that he absolutely supports wholesale, like a ban on chokeholds for example,” she said. “But it's true that the House bill does not exactly mirror our policy and the vice president's perspective. But what is also true is this — that we think criminal justice reform and police reform should be a bipartisan issue.” She added that Biden believes “qualified immunity as it stands today for police officers is too expansive,” and that “there are a range of activities that should not be covered,” such as chokeholds. The campaign said “abuses of power” should not be protected either, but declined to elaborate.Carr, Garner's mother, said in an interview that she participated in the roundtable at the invitation of Biden's team. She acknowledged that racism received more attention than at previous conventions, but wants more specifics.“There's a lot of things that I would like to sit down and talk to Biden and his team about,” she said. “A lot of times things are addressed, but then that's where it's left.”",
    "Supporters of the reforms say they are determined to convert a historic surge of advocacy into enduring change.OAKLAND — California cops battled previous attempts by state lawmakers to rein in the use of force. Now, they are active participants in negotiations to curtail policing powers, a sign of shifting dynamics that means California could, yet again, set the national standard on a major policy debate.State lawmakers, who last year passed legislation spelling out the only times police officers can shoot to kill, have seized on a rare opportunity to overhaul policing following the killing of George Floyd.Legislators have tripled the number of proposals seeking to more tightly regulate police actions. The state Legislative Black Caucus has galvanized support from colleagues, including one who previously served in law enforcement. And Gov. Gavin Newsom, who signed last year’s use-of-force bill, has called for additional changes to law enforcement rules and is being pushed to back these newest measures.Police unions that at one time would have crushed the legislative effort are now staying out of the fray.Supporters of the proposals say they are determined to convert a historic surge of advocacy into enduring change — and success in California could augur similar victories around the country, putting pressure on governors and legislatures to take action. They say they need to see advances in California, where polls show residents support the Black Lives Matter by a more than 2-to-1 margin, before the momentum is lost.“We are afraid there may be a waning of political will if we don’t do anything significant this year, in this moment,” said ACLU lobbyist Dennis Cuevas-Romero, whose group has long pushed for policing changes.The bills up for debate in Sacramento would rewrite rules around how police officers manage protests, when they must disclose misconduct and, most critically, what violations could lead the state to strip officers of their certification or penalize them for excessive use of force. One bill would go as far as requiring officers to physically restrain colleagues who step out of line.The combined weight of the legislation would amount to an unprecedented law enforcement overhaul in the nation’s most populous state, where decades of tough-on-crime politics have given way to ambitious sentencing reductions under Democratic control in the state Capitol.Major legislative actions in California regularly inspire similar moves in statehouses around the country — a function of the state’s population size and influence.A sweeping worker classification bill spurred similar state measures, while a data privacy law preceded pushes in more than a dozen other states. And California accelerated a national movement against cash bail in 2019, although its ban faces a referendum in November.Since Floyd’s death on May 25 in Minneapolis, New York enacted long-sought changes to police misconduct disclosure requirements and Colorado passed a landmark bill to end qualified immunity, a legal shield for officers that has become a national target for reform. Virginia convened a special session this week focused on policing.But the outcome in California this month will test the reform movement’s durability — and if Democrat-dominated California cannot succeed, advocates say, that will send a discouraging signal about law enforcement’s enduring power to dilute or derail reforms.“If we can’t do it here, that begs the question: can Democrats do this? Are Democrats serious about reforming policing?” said Kate Chatfield, a senior policy adviser at the Justice Collaborative, a policing reform organization. “Voters are incredibly supportive of this, so if our electeds can’t get this done, we need some new electeds.”No bill is a bigger bellwether than a yearsold proposal that the state attorney general independently review any police killing at the request of local officials.The first time Assemblymember Kevin McCarty (D-Sacramento) tried to take police slaying probes out of the hands of district attorneys, his effort collapsed against a wall of opposition from law enforcement, who have tight relationships with prosecutors.But dozens of Assembly Democrats comprising a majority of the caucus now support his current version, including police-aligned moderates. Democratic California Sen. Kamala Harris did not support McCarty’s proposal as state attorney general, but the presumptive vice presidential nominee now advocates a national version of the policy.And California’s powerful law enforcement groups are not all battling back.“I was astounded, because the response I got five years ago was the polar opposite,” said McCarty, who’s leading the Legislative Black Caucus’ approach on police changes.Floyd’s death has already sparked changes within police departments across the state, including several that have banned the use of carotid restraints that restrict an individual’s blood and airflow.Democrats will still face a powerful law enforcement lobby that has blocked bills in the past and holds sway among some moderates. And time is short in the Capitol, with less than two weeks left to broker complicated changes in police rules during a condensed session that was supposed to focus almost entirely on coronavirus legislation.Eric Nunez, president of the California Police Chiefs Association and chief of the Los Alamitos Police Department, said that he understands the legislative sense of urgency, but he’s concerned that hastily crafted legislation will create more questions than answers for officers in the field.He said that prior to the state shutting down in March in response to the pandemic, CPCA was tracking eight policing bills, a number he called manageable. After Floyd’s death in May, that number had jumped to 25 bills.“It's just not, it's not conducive to really doing all the research, all the back and forth that has to occur to hammer out this language,” Nunez said. “And I don't know where it's all going, but those are the things that we're concerned about, the structural impediments from Covid-19 and then the urgency because of the murder of George Floyd.”Even before Floyd’s death, shifting public sentiment had brought law enforcement groups like CPCA to the negotiating table.After opposing an attempt to raise California’s standard for when peace officers can use lethal force, law enforcement worked last year on landmark legislation that established new use-of-force and officer training policies.“Law enforcement clearly saw the tide change,” said Assemblymember Tim Grayson (D-Concord), one of the co-sponsors of McCarty’s bill.Those changing dynamics have recruited some unlikely allies to the cause — Grayson among them. He was formerly a Republican and a police chaplain, a template for the type of centrist Democrat who might have been reluctant to imperil his reelection by antagonizing law enforcement.But Grayson also represents the district where law enforcement shot and killed Willie McCoy and Sean Monterrosa under disputed circumstances. He has called for an independent investigation and allied with Monterrosa’s family to pursue a bill, opposed by law enforcement, entitling victims of police violence to remuneration.“I know that I have been a part of a system that has perpetuated systemic racism and injustice,” Grayson said in an interview. “I will tell you,” he added, “that system is falling to the power and strength of the voices of a community that has come together united.”While McCarty said “many in law enforcement are much more open to these changes than we saw in the last 5 to 10 years,” he noted that leadership-driven groups like the police chiefs have been more receptive than groups representing rank-and-file officers or sheriffs, who tend to be more conservative.Of all the goals energizing activists, rooting out wayward police officers sits high on the list — but it won’t be easy.A measure sponsored by state Sen. Steven Bradford (D-Gardena) would decertify officers who are convicted of crimes like falsifying records, bribery and excessive force. Bradford introduced the measure after Attorney General Xavier Becerra called for Sacramento to create a statewide decertification process.Another measure would require officers to intercede when they see excessive force being used by a fellow officer. An officer that fails to do so could be held criminally liable and face decertification.Federal law requires officers to intervene when they see other colleagues violating someone’s civil rights, and many police departments have similar mandates on the books. But those safeguards have often failed in practice, advocates say — most glaringly with Floyd’s death in Minneapolis. The California bill would go further by disqualifying officers from serving if they have failed to intervene.Peter A. Hanink, a sociology professor at California State Polytechnic University, Pomona who studies law enforcement force policies, said he was only aware of one other state, Connecticut, creating the type of broad liability the California bill would impose.“That does seem to be really a much higher consequence than has existed historically,” he said.Assemblymember Chris Holden (D-Pasadena), the author of the legislation, said he believes his bill eliminates gray areas in state law on the duty for officers to intercede.“If it happened once, it's happened before; if it's happened before, it will happen again,” Holden said, referencing the Floyd killing. “So we have to make sure that we start to take some affirmative actions, to make appropriate changes in partnership with law enforcement.”In his time pursuing police reform in Sacramento, ACLU lobbyist Cuevas-Romero said he has “never” seen this type of momentum, which he attributed in part to law enforcement “trying to save face and trying to seem relevant and seeing the writing on the wall.” But Cuevas-Romero warned against complacency.“In the world we’re living in in 2020, we don’t know what’s going to be the next big issue,” he said. “Covid could continue to dominate, and that may suck up the space, and legislators may have to shift to that.”",
    "The opening night also took on a somber tone as Democrats — and some Republicans — warned about four more years of Trump.The Democratic National Convention has a distinctly different feel this year, with the coronavirus pandemic pushing it to a virtual affair that lacks raucous crowds, behind-the-scenes dealmaking and the general pizzazz of a political celebration.It also is taking on a somber tone, with both Democratic leaders and Americans from around the country warning about what they see as the dangers of Donald Trump and the lack of leadership as Covid-19 has ravaged the United States.Big questions loom over the four-day event: Will Joe Biden get a convention bump in the polls? Will the Democratic Party anoint a new rising star? How will Kamala Harris handle her big moment? Will Trump try to stomp on the event? Here are key moments from the first night.Michelle Obama delivered an impassioned plea for a Biden presidency, slamming Trump as a president out of his depth and urging Americans to rise above the politics of division.Wearing a necklace spelling \"V-O-T-E,” the former first lady urged Americans to cast a ballot, via mail or in person, for Biden “like our lives depend on it.” In a speech that largely avoided mentioning the incumbent by name, Obama labeled Trump as the wrong president for the country.“He has had more than enough time to prove that he can do the job, but he is clearly in over his head. He cannot meet this moment,” Obama said with an air of resignation. “He simply cannot be who we need him to be for us. It is what it is.”“Going high is the only thing that works,” Obama said in a reprisal of her trademark, “When they go low, we go high” mantra of 2016.The opening night featured a moment of silence for George Floyd, the Black man killed by Minneapolis police in May, delivered by his brother Philonise. Philonise Floyd commended the nationwide protests against racial injustice as a fitting tribute for his late brother and listed the names of other Black Americans killed by police. “For the names we do not know, the faces we’ll never see, those who can't mourn because their murders didn't go viral, please join me in a moment of silence to honor George and the many other souls we lost to hate and injustice,” Philonise Floyd said. “And when this moment ends, let's make sure we never stop saying their names.”D.C. Mayor Muriel Boswer introduced Philonise and his brother Rodney while standing at a balcony overlooking the newly minted “Black Lives Matter Plaza” — just blocks from the White House.‘We can't just paint those words behind me, we can't just say those words. We have to live those words,” Bowser said. “We have to undo the laws and systems that have codified racism for far too long.”New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo slammed Trump for his handling of the coronavirus pandemic and his failure to unite the nation.“Only a strong body can fight off the virus. And America's divisions weakened it,” Cuomo said. “Donald Trump didn't create the initial division. The division created Trump.” Cuomo, who saw his national stock rise during the pandemic thanks to his frequent press conferences and aggressive measures to combat the outbreak, said the Trump administration’s incompetence led to its weak virus defense.“Now we need a leader as good as our people, a leader who appeals to the best within us, not the worst, a leader who can unify, not divide, a leader who can bring us up, not tear us down,” Cuomo said. “That man is Joe Biden.”During a brief panel that focused on police violence, Biden said that “most cops are good. The fact is that the bad ones have to be identified, prosecuted and out, period.”The message is a stark contrast from the repeated calls from Trump’s camp that Biden is out to “defund the police” and from the anti-police chants that have been ringing at protests in cities across the country. Biden told reporters in July that he didn’t agree with defunding police departments, but that officers needed to “meet minimum basic standards of decency.”Biden has called for reform among police-community relations, and asked the panelists about the best course to do so. Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot pressed the need for economic opportunity in struggling communities, and Houston Police Chief Art Acevedo suggested a national ban on chokeholds.Kristin Urquiza’s father voted for and supported Trump. But she said Trump’s coronavirus response was why her father is dead. “His only pre-existing condition was trusting Donald Trump, and for that, he paid with his life,” Urquiza said.Urquiza, who had gone viral for a blistering obituary condemning elected officials’ coronavirus response, blasted Trump for his management of the crisis during a brief DNC appearance. She lay into the inequalities in care that particularly impact communities of color. She contrasted Trump and Biden, saying Trump has refused to heed the advice of health experts and has exacerbated the pandemic. Urquiza said her father regretted voting for Trump as he died and dedicated her vote for Biden to him.“The coronavirus has made it clear that there are two Americas: The America that Donald Trump lives in and the America that my father died in.”John Kasich, the former Ohio governor and one of Trump’s primary challengers back in 2016, stood at a literal crossroads as he talked about his choice to vote for Biden, despite being a longstanding Republican. “I'm a lifelong Republican, but that attachment holds second place to my responsibility to my country,’ he said. “That's why I have chosen to appear at this convention. In normal times, something like this would probably never happen. But these are not normal times.”Kasich was the first person to run for president and then speak at the opposing party’s convention four years later since former Sen. Joe Lieberman spoke on behalf of Republican nominee John McCain in 2008.During his short speech, Kasich emphasized Biden’s reputation as a moderate Democrat. \"I'm sure there are Republicans and independents who couldn't imagine crossing over to support a Democrat. They fear Joe may turn sharp left and leave them behind. I don't believe that because I know the measure of the man,” he said. Kasich was joined with other lifelong Republicans, including former Hewlett Packard CEO Meg Whitman, former New York Rep. Susan Molinari and former New Jersey Gov. Christine Whitman, who has been a vocal critic of Trump and supported Kasich during the 2016 GOP primaries. Nevada Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto called out Trump for denigrating mail-in voting, pointing out how the president himself has requested absentee ballots twice this year.Cortez Masto’s home state of Nevada became the subject of Trump’s ridicule when it moved to expand mail-in voting amid the coronavirus pandemic. She blasted Trump for trying to undermine those efforts in court and by cutting down on postal services.“My home state took the advice of scientists and medical experts and listened to the people of Nevada to put in place a vote-by-mail system so voters have a lot of options this fall,” she said. “But Donald Trump is trying to divide us by undermining that right.”Trump and Postmaster General Louis DeJoy have faced fierce criticism for changes to the U.S. Postal Service that they have cast as cost-saving measures but that have led to serious delays. A group of voters filed a lawsuit Monday against DeJoy and Trump, accusing them of conspiring to undermine the election by gutting mail services.The Democratic field saw fierce confrontations this election cycle as candidates fought for the nomination. But those conflicts were nowhere to be found at the party’s convention.A consortium of Biden’s former Democratic rivals popped into the convention for a montage praising the candidate as the future of the party. Cory Booker, Amy Klobuchar, Kirsten Gillibrand and a number of other former candidates spoke about their time on the grueling campaign trail, including their interactions with Biden. They all portrayed Biden as a candidate of strong character who reached out to them as a friend, in spite of the stiff competition for the nomination.Booker brought up a special moment from the debate stage: “What was remarkable to me was in the commercial break he puts his arm around me and starts telling me how good my ideas are,” he said. “And next thing you know, I feel like he's giving me a pep talk and literally telling me how important it is, how really important it is that I'm on that stage.”Andrew Yang was among the candidates to praise Biden, though he had previously expressed disappointment at not being on the speakers list for the convention.“Joe called me the night I suspended and was extraordinarily gracious and comforting, and he told me I should be proud of myself,” he said. “Said that I did myself and my family a real service and the country a service.” Biden’s biggest primary rival, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), painted Trump as an authoritarian threat to the United States and urged his supporters to elect Biden.“The future of our democracy is at stake. The future of our economy is at stake. The future of our planet is at stake,” Sanders said. “My friends, the price of failure is just too great to imagine.”In a rare mention of policy detail during the night, the Vermont senator noted he and Biden diverge on how to provide every American with healthcare — the defining issue of the primary campaign. But in a sign of unity, Sanders said that Biden’s plan would nevertheless expand coverage, lower prescription drug prices, and enroll more Americans into Medicare.",
    "Over the years, courts have carefully updated our speech protections while mostly ignoring the freedom of assembly. Now they may have a chance to change that.In recent months, American cities have seen widespread protests denouncing police brutality against unarmed Black people. Local and national law enforcement agencies, responding to crowds of unprecedented size and scale, relied on methods that were equally unprecedented. In Portland, federal officers unleashed torrents of tear gas and paintballs, pulled protesters into unmarked vans and severely injured one demonstrator in front of a federal courthouse. Police in Orlando, Chicago, New York, and other cities resorted to the use of long-range acoustic devices (LRADs), a weapon frequently used by the U.S. military in sonic warfare and one with the potential to cause permanent hearing loss to those exposed to it. Other tactics were harsh enough to cause severe injuries, such as loss of vision, in at least 12 reported cases. National Guard helicopters hovered dangerously close to protesters in Washington, capturing images and videos of the crowds, kicking up shards of broken glass and sending many looking for cover. For many Americans, this seemed to be exactly how the federal government is not supposed to respond to demonstrations in a country that has a constitutionally protected freedom of assembly. To be sure, in some cases, the harsher tactics were in response to outbreaks of crowd violence, including attempted arson of local police buildings in cities such as Portland. But independent expert reviews of police responses showed a clear pattern in which use of excessive force by the police escalated many confrontations. And to many watching at home or on the street, the police response was widespread enough in cities that it appeared the line between how law enforcement responds to mob violence and how it responds to regular assembly had been blurred. There’s a reason for that: For more than 30 years, the Supreme Court has failed to take up a freedom-of-assembly case. As a result, this fundamental constitutional right is in sore need of an update, such as a ruling that would protect protesters from the unduly harsh police response that has become all too common as a response to demonstrations in recent years.The First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution explicitly describes the right of the people to peaceably assemble. This right is recognized separately from the right to freedom of speech because the founders believed that the act of organizing a large crowd for a demonstration, parade or protest could be more powerful than individual speech, and was therefore even more susceptible to government encroachment. Like the right to religious expression, the founders gave the right to protest its own listing intending for the courts to give it special treatment and fashion unique legal standards that would ensure its protection. This has happened with the other specifically enshrined rights. With free speech, for example, the Supreme Court has in recent years defined specific kinds of modern speech—computer code, or speech on the internet—and protections for them. But over the past 50 years, the courts have ducked that responsibility to protect the freedom of assembly, laying the groundwork for the hyperaggressive police response to protests that is observed in the streets today.The Supreme Court shirked this responsibility first by holding that the right to assembly did not protect anything like the right to protest in the streets, beginning with a formative ruling in 1886. At the time, labor unrest and revolt were widespread, and many state governments were passing laws aimed at preventing potential insurrections by workers’ organizations. It had also become common practice for state police and troops to violently disperse labor union meetings and demonstrations, and in response to this practice, many labor groups began arming their members. When one group of German-American socialist workers organized a parade in Chicago, in which members carried unloaded rifles, members of the group were prosecuted for marching in the streets without a license from the governor. In addition to claiming that their Second Amendment right to bear arms had been violated, the members claimed that by marching in the streets, they were exercising their right to assembly. The Supreme Court ruled that the right to assembly did not give a blanket right to protest in the streets. Instead, the court ruled that the First Amendment protected the right to speak to the government only through activities such as forming a political group or lobbying Congress. In effect, the justices subsumed the right to protest within the more expansive right of freedom of speech, suggesting that the right to protest would be subject to the same protections as individual speech. But that’s not what happened. In fact, the court has over the years declined to protect the right to protest with one of the most important legal standards they have used to protect freedom of speech: the chilling-effect doctrine. This doctrine, first used by the Supreme Court and then frequently cited afterward in free-speech decisions in lower courts, holds that fear of government punishment can deter free expression as strongly as application of actual punishment. In cases involving individual speech, the courts rely on the chilling-effect doctrine to prohibit government action that makes people afraid to speak on a certain topic.The origins of the chilling-effect doctrine go back to the Cold War. The U.S. government knew that it could not prohibit individuals from producing communist literature or joining communist organizations without violating the First Amendment right to free speech. Instead, to achieve the same goal, states and federal government passed laws that would have revealed to the government the identity of those sympathetic to the communist cause. For example, state employees were asked to take an oath of allegiance to the government of the United States, and those wanting to receive communist literature were asked to give their information to the U.S. Postal Service before receiving such material through mail. Although none of these actions would have directly punished individuals for expressing their beliefs, the Supreme Court was quick to see the new threat they posed to the freedom of speech. It was enough, the Court ruled, that these requirements created an atmosphere of fear around certain expressions and that many might self-censor in the future out of fear of punishment. The Supreme Court found both of the above-mentioned laws to be unconstitutional in two separate rulings, citing the chilling-effect doctrine. The court had already made the suggestion earlier that the freedom of assembly was essentially an extension of the freedom of speech, which would also seem to mean that the chilling-effect should apply to the freedom of assembly, too. But that is not how courts have ruled. For decades, lower-level courts ignored requests to apply the chilling-effect doctrine to harsh crowd-control tactics, finding the advocates’ plea that such practices can impact future participation in protests to be tenuous. The courts’ failure to update Americans’ understanding of the freedom of assembly has given law enforcement free rein to deploy strategies that increasingly have the potential to deter future participation in protests. This is nowhere more evident than in the type of the cases that make their way to the courts. Whereas 10 years ago the courts had to decide whether NYPD’s use of mounted police that frequently stepped on protesters’ feet was objectionable (they decided that it was not), today they hear cases about armies of special forces equipped with riot gear, chemical weapons and other top-level military-grade weaponry. Every step of this transformation in policing crowds has been fueled by the courts’ refusal to rein in the proclivity for an increasingly stronger show of force. But a slew of new cases gives the courts a new chance to revisit many of the faulty assumptions that have long bedeviled their approach to the right to protest. This month, Oregon Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum, sued the federal government over the exercise of harsh protest-suppression methods in Portland. Rosenblum asked the federal court to declare such “police-state tactics,” to be unconstitutional, citing its potential to have a chilling effect on future lawful participation in protests. Similar lawsuits have been initiated by local activist groups in Chicago and in Minneapolis. In other cities, such as Seattle, legislative authorities are filling the gaps left by the courts, banning the use of nonlethal weapons, such as acoustic weapons and chemical irritants. In Oregon, Rosenblum’s request was blocked due to standing—meaning that someone else will have to raise the issue—and the pace of the other decisions will likely be slow because of the pandemic.But the courts could finally have a chance to revisit the role they have played in shaping the slow eradication of the right to protest in the United States, the right that gave us the march to Selma and the women’s vote. And we should hope that this time, they find it worth protecting.",
    "They’ve worked in other countries. In the middle of a national reckoning on race, some advocates are wondering: Why not here?In a South African courtroom in 1995, a woman let out a scream so bone-chilling in its distillation of anger, injustice and grief that decades later it still rings in the ears of those who were present. The woman was Nomonde Calata, who was 26 years old and pregnant with her third child in 1985, when her husband, the schoolteacher and anti-apartheid activist Fort Calata was abducted and brutally assaulted by apartheid government security forces. When his body was found days later, it had been completely burned. Calata’s scream cut through her testimony to South Africa’s Truth and Reconciliation Commission, which had been established to adjudicate the brutal, racist tactics used by the country’s apartheid government. Her testimony—and that of thousands of other victims of apartheid—was broadcast on television and radio, entering the homes of hundreds of thousands of viewers worldwide. It was recorded to help ensure that the crimes of apartheid would not be forgotten, and should never be repeated.In countries around the world, the public airing of stories like Calata’s has been seen as a necessary way to acknowledge and ultimately move past systemic injustices. Over the past 50 years, this process—usually called a truth and reconciliation commission, though some use the words “justice” or “dignity”—has become one of the most important tools in healing national division. Employed in various forms in at least 46 countries—from South Africa to Peru to Canada—these commissions have a track record of helping societies to at least begin to move beyond otherwise intractable problems, including dictatorship (Argentina), genocide (Rwanda), civil war (El Salvador), ethnic conflict (Solomon Islands) and revolution (Tunisia). If ever there has been a time for the United States to undergo a similar process, there’s a strong argument that moment is now. This spring, the police killing of George Floyd and several other Black Americans offered a painful reminder of the persistence of racism across American history and society. The resulting Black Lives Matter protests have been declared the largest political movement in U.S. history, with 10 percent of the population attending, across all 50 states. And recent polls show that 76 percent of Americans now consider racism and discrimination a “big problem,” an increase of 26 percentage points from 2015. The depth of division over race in the United States—and the growing calls for change—suggest to some activists that the moment demands something bigger than a “national conversation.”“In all of my 72 years, almost all of which I’ve been working as an activist, I’ve never seen anything like this,” says Fania Davis, director of the nonprofit Restorative Justice for Oakland Youth. “We are beginning to disrupt centuries of denial of our collective biography during this time. Whenever you have such an intense crisis, it also presents an opportunity for significant or revolutionary change.”And yet, with some exceptions, the idea of a national, formal reconciliation process has not been a central part of the discussion about how the country can move forward, and few politicians are pushing such a measure. Why not the United States too? The activists and experts I spoke with, some of whom have worked on truth commissions in other countries, pointed to several obstacles: extreme partisanship; lack of political buy-in, or the imagination to look outside the United States for inspiration; a long history of injustice, as opposed to a singular, dramatic event; and the systemic, widespread nature of racism in Black American life. But smaller-scale versions of reconciliation have worked here before, and at least three American cities are beginning to undertake their own reconciliation efforts, which activists hope could generate grassroots support for a larger effort.Ultimately, the countries around the world that have launched truth commissions did so in spite of these kinds of challenges—widespread disapproval, political tension and occasionally violence.“In the U.S., we have the resources to do this,” says Jaya Ramji-Nogales, a Temple University law professor focused on human rights. “It’s just a question of political will.”The first truth commissions began in the late 1970s in Latin America as fact-finding missions to uncover truths about dictatorships and military juntas; Argentina’s 1983 National Commission on the Disappeared is considered the first well-publicized commission.Although they are not a cure-all, truth commissions historically have helped societies to address collective trauma and abuse. According to the International Center for Transitional Justice, an international human rights group, the common features of such commissions include “the recognition of the dignity of individuals, the redress and acknowledgment of violations, and the aim to prevent them from happening again.” “There are certain best practices,” adds Kerry Whigham of the Auschwitz Institute for the Prevention of Genocide and Mass Atrocities. Whoever is responsible for setting up the commission, its makeup should be politically independent, Whigham says, and must include victims or members of targeted groups, who, he says, “have to determine what the structure of the commission looks like, what the mandate is, what recommendations to give.”The process might sound like a courtroom proceeding, but the goal is starkly different. Rather than hard findings of guilt or innocence, the idea is to create a safe forum to air grievances and enter into the public record, as a form of both collective catharsis and, ultimately, accountability. Victims are not cross-examined, but are allowed “to speak their truth in their own words, as opposed to being directed or controlled by a larger purpose or narrative,” says Ronald Slye, a law professor at Seattle University who served as a legal consultant to truth commissions in South Africa and Kenya. Or as Anna Myriam Roccatello, the ICTJ’s deputy executive director, puts it, “The victims become protagonists.” South Africa is the country that’s most often held up as an example of a successful truth and reconciliation commission. Desmond Tutu and Nelson Mandela, two figures who carried weight both domestically and internationally, spearheaded the seven-year process. Over that time, the commission—made up of 17 high-profile activists and political figures, supported by 300 staff members—collected 21,000 victim testimonies, of which 2,000 were publicly broadcast. For many white South Africans, it was the first time they had heard, in such detail, the physical and psychological harm Black South Africans had endured during apartheid. After the commission finished its work, it produced a report, as is customary, with recommendations including reparations, reformation of the political and social sectors, and, in some cases, prosecution of perpetrators.But the commission was not entirely a success. Some victims are still waiting on financial reparations; and South Africa’s police force still disproportionately brutalizes Black citizens. Because perpetrators were allowed to exchange testimony for amnesty, many victims felt that justice had not been served. And while only 1,000 of the 7,112 perpetrators were granted amnesty, none was prosecuted. Mandela made a point not to alienate white South Africans in an effort to unite the country, and South Africa would later be criticized for focusing too much on reconciliation at the expense of victims. Even as most truth commissions have achieved some tangible results, Roccatello explains, such mixed outcomes are hardly atypical. “Even if you have the best energy at the beginning, the commissions rarely continue evenly and consistently,” she says. “You take one step forward and three steps back. … What really makes the difference is the incredible never-ending resilience of victims.”Some Western countries attach a stigma to truth commissions—they are for failed or failing states, the thinking goes. But the United States, in fact, has experimented with such commissions in the past.In 1980, Congress set up the Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians in order to investigate the relocation and internment of Japanese Americans and Japanese nationals during World War II, culminating in reparations of $20,000 paid to each survivor, as well as education initiatives and a public apology from Congress. In 2004, the Greensboro Truth and Reconciliation Commission investigated the death of five protesters during an anti-Ku Klux Klan rally in 1979. While the commission gave a platform to survivors to share their stories, it did not get the support of the city of Greensboro. “Ultimately the predominantly white City Council rejected the TRC process and the commission's 500-page report—in the end, only offering a statement of regret,” notes the Carnegie Council.The ongoing Maryland Lynching Truth and Reconciliation Commission, which was established in 2019 with bipartisan support in the state Legislature, researches cases of racially motivated lynchings and holds public meetings and regional hearings about them. As part of the commission, individuals can also speak about their ancestral connection to lynchings, from both victims’ and perpetrators’ perspectives. (During the Covid-19 pandemic, the public meetings have moved to publicly accessible conference calls.) These initiatives, however, have had narrower mandates than would a national truth and reconciliation commission around racism—its long history in the United States, its persistence into the present and the millions of living Americans who could be considered victims. That daunting sense of scale might be one factor pushing against a nationwide initiative on race in the United States: For a commission to work as a mechanism of both truth-telling and justice, it would need to address issues ranging from the history of slavery to school segregation to policing to employment and wealth disparity. Perhaps the closest domestic model to date for a national effort is President Bill Clinton’s 1997 “initiative on race”—set up to address racism through a “candid conversation on the state of race relations today,” as the White House billed it. Clinton appointed a seven-member advisory board tasked with meeting the initiative’s goals of “study, dialogue, and action,” through town hall meetings, educational initiatives, promoting community dialogue and concrete recommendations. But the initiative was dismissed as largely symbolic and lost momentum as Clinton’s personal scandals grabbed the country’s attention. Any new initiative would need to take more concrete actions, activists say. In the United States, it’s difficult to imagine a truth commission on race that wouldn’t prosecute police officers, for instance. Black people account for 28 percent of police murders but only 13 percent of the population, and in 99 percent of police killings from 2013-19, officers were not charged with a crime, according to data from the research and advocacy group Mapping Police Violence.Today’s heightened partisanship presents another obstacle. While Congress would not need presidential support to set up a national commission on racism, the transitional justice experts I spoke with were in agreement that the current divided Congress isn’t likely to launch any such initiative, nor is the Trump administration likely to support one. “The idea that there could be these processes at any level that wouldn’t be weaponized by the right and the left is not mindful of our current reality,” says Peter T. Coleman, professor of psychology and education at Columbia University who studies intractable conflict and sustainable peace.There are more intangible factors, too—including denial. “People in the U.S. refuse to make the connection between slavery, Jim Crow and all the institutional racism going on currently,” says Ereshnee Naidu-Silverman, a South African-born senior program director at the International Coalition of Sites of Conscious, a global network of sites and initiatives that memorialize victims of atrocities. “In the U.S., we very often deny things that are right in front of us and think America is the exception to many things that are occurring every day,” adds Dina Bailey, CEO of Mountain Top Vision, a consulting company that helps organizations become more inclusive.To get political buy-in, Whigham, of the Auschwitz Institute for the Prevention of Genocide and Mass Atrocities, says pressure would need to come from the grassroots: “Generally speaking, governments don’t have it in their personal interest to create something that could destabilize those personal interests.”And there are some signs that this kind of grassroots support is growing—and is reaching the halls of power. In early June, Congresswoman Barbara Lee (D-Calif.) announced legislation calling for the establishment of the first United States Commission on Truth, Racial Healing, and Transformation. The legislation has been backed by 146 lawmakers, though all are Democrats. (Before he died last month, Congressman John Lewis voiced support.)On June 30, the district attorneys in Boston, Philadelphia and San Francisco announced they would each create commissions to address racism and police brutality, with plans to launch as early as this fall. The initiatives are backed by The Grassroots Law Project, a group co-founded by activists Shaun King and Lee Merritt to advocate on behalf of Black men and women who have been killed by police or wrongfully convicted. In March, after two white men killed Ahmaud Arbery, a 25-year-old Black man in Georgia, King, who previously lived in South Africa and had already worked with Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner, began exploring the idea of establishing a city-based truth, justice and reconciliation commission, he said in an interview. He approached Krasner, followed by the district attorneys in Boston and in San Francisco, who also signed on. The commissions, which will each function separately, are in the early phases of working with local communities to figure out what their mandates and structures will be. Reparations, prosecution and official pardons by state prosecutors are among the ideas on the table, King says.King previously has been accused of mismanaging funds for other advocacy efforts, allegations he denies. The Boston, Philadelphia and San Francisco commissions will be jointly staffed and funded by the DA offices and Grassroots Law. “We want to create compassionate pathways and ecosystems for truth to be told and shared and valued, [in ways] that earnestly do not exist right now,” King says. “We think we can create alternative definitions of what justice really means. … For some families, that may mean helping to set new policies to prevent what happened to their loved ones to someone else. Getting a sincere seat at the table is a form of justice for some people.”Some advocates argue that this kind of local approach might ultimately be more effective than a national commission. “People’s concept of justice is not homogeneous,” says Naidu-Silverman. Fania Davis of the Restorative Justice for Oakland Youth points to the work community organizers have done in schools, prisons and other parts of the community, including organizations like MPD 150 in Minneapolis, and Showing up for Racial Justice. “We can’t rely on existing systems or governments to lead these processes,” she says. “If these processes are hierarchical, or top-down, or government-centered, we will just create a new future of hierarchy and systems of dominations.” “We need to do truth-telling for quite a while still,” she says. “But the dam is broken.”",
    "The social media company said it took action against 22.5 million pieces of content containing hate speech between April and June.Facebook on Tuesday said it updated its hate speech policy to include a ban on images of blackface and anti-Semitic tropes.The company said it changed its standards to \"more specifically account for certain kinds of implicit hate speech,\" including caricatures of Black people in the form of blackface and Jewish people running the world or controlling major institutions such as media networks, the economy or the government.Blackface is a controversial subject in the Netherlands and Belgium, because of the Christmas tradition of Zwarte Piet (Black Pete), a \"helper\" of Saint Nicholas who is typically played by a white person whose face is blacked up. The tradition has been criticized by activist groups for being racist.Justice Commissioner Didier Reynders, who is Belgian, dressed in blackface for a charity event in 2015 — an act he has not apologized for.The Flemish town of Aalst has also been criticized for racist depictions of Jews during its annual festival.Facebook has been under renewed pressure to do more to quash racism on its platforms following the killing of George Floyd, an unarmed Black man, at the hands of the police in the U.S. in May.In its report on Tuesday, the company said it took action against 22.5 million pieces of content containing hate speech between April and June, a leap from the 9.6 million pieces of content it similarly admonished during the first three months of the year. Facebook did not say if the actions referred to post removals, warning labels or other measures.On its photo-sharing platform, Instagram, the company took action against 3.3 million pieces of content, which also marks a sizable jump from 809,000 pieces during the first three months of the year.",
    "The battle to define the movement comes as the president and fellow GOP candidates try to win back suburban voters.For a brief moment after George Floyd was killed by a Minneapolis policeman in late May, some members of the GOP joined calls for change as protests exploded onto streets across the country. That moment is over. Facing possible electoral calamity, Republicans are now turning to a familiar playbook: stoking fear by trying to redefine the Black Lives Matter movement as a radical leftist mob looking to sabotage the white, suburban lifestyle.Republicans are using two lines of attack: the Trump administration, candidates in safe red seats and right-wing social media channels seek to label the entire movement “Marxist” and anti-family as they try to energize their conservative base. Republicans running in swing districts and states, meanwhile, are tying their Democratic opponents to activists’ demands to defund police departments, while avoiding explicitly mentioning Black Lives Matter. Instead, Republicans running in competitive general election races have focused recent ads on more abstract targets like “left-wing radicals\" and the \"liberal mob.\"It’s a distinction Democratic pollsters and lawmakers attribute to the dramatic shift in public views on police brutality, and who and what people associate with the declaration that “Black Lives Matter.” The new broad support for the movement, they say, makes it harder to tie Black Lives Matter to one person, organization or ideology.“People putting ‘Black Lives Matter’ signs on their lawns, it's not an endorsement of a particular organization so much as a value statement uniting a lot of people from many backgrounds,” said Democratic Rep. Tom Malinowksi, whose predominantly white New Jersey district was held by Republicans for decades before he won in 2018. That hasn't deterred Republicans, who have increased their criticism of the movement over the past month. On the same day President Donald Trump tweeted that Black Lives Matter was “a symbol of hate,” his personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, declared to a group of reporters at the White House that \"Black Lives Matter is a Marxist organization … Black Lives Matter has been planning to destroy the police for three years.” Other Trump administration officials and Republican lawmakers, particularly those running in tough primaries, followed suit, warning, in addition, that the movement wanted to destroy the “nuclear family.” Fox News hosts, conservative talk radio personalities and think tanks such as The Heritage Foundation joined in, as well. Prager University’s “Black Lives Matter is a Marxist Movement” video released this month has over a million views on YouTube and is one of several popular videos it has produced on the topic.So far, the GOP attempts to discredit the movement have yet to stick. With just under three months until the election, Black Lives Matter has won mainstream support across racial and partisan lines that would have been almost unthinkable six months ago. But the battle to define the movement is not over, as Trump bets he can turn the suburbs, lost to Republicans in 2018, in his favor by attempting to cast a movement for racial equality as a threat to white voters. “We recognize that this is not simply an issue fight, this isn't simply a narrative war — what we think we're experiencing is a social and cultural and political realignment,” said Maurice Mitchell, national director of the Working Families Party and a leader with the Movement for Black Lives coalition. “We continue to give that backlash the adequate concern and respect one would give any dangerous opponent, even one that clearly is on the wrong side of history.”Though Black Lives Matter is a decentralized ecosystem that encompasses more than 150 organizations, Trump’s allies are trying to wed the entire movement to the personal beliefs of a pair of self-described Marxists who formed the Black Lives Matter Global Network in 2013, in the aftermath of the killing of Trayvon Martin. Many other supporters and leaders organizing under the Black Lives Matter banner — which is now considered to be the largest racial justice movement in the history of the country — don’t identify with Marxism.Trump-endorsed Tennessee Senate candidate Bill Hagerty told POLITICO that Black Lives Matter wants to see the “destruction of the nuclear family.” Speaking to a TV pundit with ties to white supremacy, Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler recently attacked WNBA players for promoting the \"Black Lives Matter” message and has repeatedly used the Marxist tag. Conservative critiques are based on the fact that two founders of Black Lives Matter Global Network, Patrisse Cullors and Alicia Garza, are self-declared Marxists — a description Cullors used in a 2015 interview. Republicans have also criticized language on the network's website which says one of its missions is to “disrupt the Western-prescribed nuclear family structure requirement.”Garza and Cullors first made the #BlackLivesMatter hashtag go viral after the acquittal of Martin's killer. Their group also owns BlackLivesMatter.com and has been an advocate of defunding the police. “Yes, I’m trained in different economic philosophies,” Cullors said in a statement through a spokesperson, but added, “I refuse to be reduced to a single clip from an interview that was manipulated for white supremacist and right wing fear mongering.” She declined an interview.Melina Abdullah, a Pan-African Studies professor at California State University, Los Angeles and head of BLM's LA chapter, wrote the passage on the nuclear family that is featured on the BLMGN website. Abdullah explained that it is an “affirmation of the African principle that it takes a village to raise a child. It's invoking the idea that all of us are responsible for our collective children.” Republican efforts “to assail that statement actually has opened up an important conversation within the Black community,” Abdullah said. “It hasn't had the backlash that I think that they wanted it to have.”In a sign that the Marxism tag might already be falling flat, Giuliani took his attacks a step further Thursday, falsely accusing BLM activists of being terrorists. \"These are people who hate white people,\" Giuliani said on Fox News. \"These are killers.\"Some Republican strategists believe that the combination of early summer riots, the controversial stances of some BLMGN members, plus the mainstreaming of “defund the police,” have given them an opening to diminish Democrats' current electoral advantage. Democrats and BLM organizers point to the polls, describing the GOP strategy as a nakedly racist last gasp that won’t gain traction outside the right-wing echo chamber.“The average voter in that swing suburb is not thinking about BLM as [select] leaders of the movement,” said Jefrey Pollock, president of polling firm Global Strategy Group, who works with Democrats in swing House and Senate races. “They're thinking about the larger conversation that is happening about African Americans and racial injustice.”At the moment, more than 60 percent of Americans support the movement, according to recent polls. And 62 percent of white people say minorities are not treated equally in the criminal justice system — up 18 points since 2014. Voters in urban areas support the BLM movement by 73 percent, suburban voters by 62 percent and rural voters by 54 percent, according to July Navigator research done by GSG and GBAO Strategies provided to POLITICO. One senior Republican strategist noted, however, that while support continues to be high, opposition to the BLM movement spiked 9 points in July, according to Civiqs.Ian Prior, a Republican strategist working to unseat swing district Democrat Rep. Matt Cartwright in Scranton, Pa., acknowledged that BLM is difficult to campaign against but argued that the movement — and Democrats supporting it — has given Republicans an opening on supporting police. “Explaining the difference between the Black Lives Matter movement versus the Black Lives Matter sentiment — there’s nuance there and nuance is hard in politics,” he said. “But support for law enforcement, that’s not nuanced and that’s where I think you’ll see a lot of the Republican messaging in tough races.”So far, Republican candidates who are currently airing ads have mostly refrained from directly naming the BLM movement. In ads that aired from May 25 to the end of July, only one GOP ad in a primary race used the words “Black Lives Matter,” while saying that liberals don’t care about Black lives, and another used the term “violent thugs,” according to an analysis provided by Ad Analytics. But as primaries pass — dragged out because of the pandemic — and general election races ramp up, Democrats in vulnerable seats are bracing for more Republicans to step up their attacks.“I actually stood up in front of 1,500 people at a Black Lives Matter rally and said explicitly that I disagree with the ‘defund the police’ slogan,” Malinowksi said. “And it will not stop them from accusing me of defunding the police because that's just the Republican talking point everywhere this year.”Though, notably, Malinowksi’s Republican opponent, state Sen. Thomas Kean Jr., attended a BLM rally this summer. Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden has walked a similar tightrope — embracing protesters’ urgent condemnations of racial injustice without backing some of their proposed solutions, such as calls to “defund the police.” Asked for comment about the co-founders of BLMGM, Biden’s campaign pointed to past statements on the campaign trail when he said, “I ain’t a socialist.”",
    "For students on scholarships from Africa, racism is an everyday reality. Kasia Kovacs is a freelance journalist and writer based in London and Budapest. BUDAPEST — For African students studying in Hungarian universities, the recent wave of protests that swept across Europe in response to the killing of George Floyd in the United States was a reminder of the uneasy position they occupy in their adopted country.Many have come to Hungary on scholarships to study in prestigious higher-education programs that offer them a temporary entry-way into Europe. The program, which is not widely known locally though it is funded by tax-payer money, has brought thousands of African students to the country’s universities on scholarships for the past 50 years.Still, the number of African residents in Hungary remains small — some 7,200 people, according to 2020 data — and a general lack of diversity coupled with anti-immigrant sentiment stoked by Prime Minister Viktor Orbán’s right-wing government means racism is an everyday reality for many of them. Some report they have been spat on, called racial slurs and heard strangers make monkey noises as they walk by.So when a group of African students, along with other expats and local Hungarians, gathered outside the U.S. Embassy in Budapest in June in solidarity with anti-racism movements in other countries, few were surprised to see counter-protesters appear carrying signs that read “White lives also matter” and chanting “Hungária.” Although the small group of hecklers was peacefully dispersed, the incident is symptomatic of the lack of awareness of racial issues in the country and everyday taunts, they say.\"It happens every week, at least,\" Maveens Okwudiri Okwunwa, a Nigerian communications student at Budapest Metropolitan University, said in an interview in central Budapest, referring to the racism he experiences living in Hungary. As we spoke, a man shouted \"Ape! Ape!\" at him in the background. * * *Hungary’s decades-old scholarship program for African students is seemingly at odds with its more recent hardline position on immigration.In European debates on the relocation of asylum seekers, the Hungarian government has blocked efforts to relocate refugees across Europe. It was also one of the first countries to close its borders and adopt unapologetic anti-immigrant rhetoric centered on protecting Hungarian Christian values from outsiders.Orbán’s government has also gone to battle with Central European University, which has a large number of international students, over alleged foreign influence — a conflict that led to the relocation of several CEU programs to Vienna.The two policies — welcoming students from over 60 countries via scholarships and taking a staunchly anti-immigrant approach when it comes to refugees — “do not seem coherent,” said István Tarrósy, a professor of political science and African studies at the University of Pécs.And yet, recently, Hungary has ramped up its outreach to Africa. Last year, the government announced it would offer scholarships to about 900 African students to study at Hungarian universities — in addition to the 1,710 Africans who already received scholarships that year — as part of its “Africa Program.”The scholarship program has its roots in the Cold War. Like many countries in the Eastern bloc, Hungary admitted several African students starting in the 1960s. Between 1964 and 1967, the number of African students in Hungary rose from 198 to 398.The push was initially designed as a type of educational and ideological exchange that would help the socialist country open up to the world. Many of the students who were part of those first waves of scholarships put down roots in the country and still live there with their families.\"The thousands of African professionals who graduated from Hungarian universities in the '70s and '80s form an unbreakable link between our country and the continent,\" the state-sponsored Budapest Africa Forum said in a statement in 2013.In more recent years, the Hungarian government has sought to create more ties to Africa, including through investments, which it frames as a way to stabilize volatile regions from which people would otherwise flee, seeking to better their fortunes in Europe. (It has also invested in Latin America and the Caribbean, following a similar logic.)Pursuing a strategy of opening up to the south, including through trade ties, to ensure “fast growth” will “help dissuade potential migrants from leaving their homes,” Foreign Minister Péter Szijjártó said in 2015.Since the height of the refugee crisis — when some 67,000 asylum seekers passed through Hungary in the first six months of 2015 — the issue of immigration has dominated political discourse in the country.The scholarships fit into the country’s goal of “controlling immigration,” said Dr. Elżbieta Goździak, a professor of migration studies at Georgetown University, who added that it was about choosing what type of person is allowed into the country and, crucially, how long they can stay. * * *The word \"migrant,\" or \"migráns\" in Hungarian, once had a neutral connotation. In fact, Hungarians rarely used the word before 2015, according to research by Ildikó Barna, a sociologist at Eötvös Loránd University who has tracked the government’s role in stoking prejudice against foreigners.It was only in the wake of the refugee crisis, Barna's research found, that migrants were largely depicted as a threat to public security. It’s a shift that has created a surge in xenophobic rhetoric and “fear of the other,” said Tarrósy, the African Studies professor.\"There is a huge prejudice against Black individuals,\" Barna said, because many Hungarians may not necessarily differentiate between migrants and people who look like they could be migrants, including Africans who moved to Hungary by choice or received scholarships to study at local universities.\"Even for people who are half-Black and speak Hungarian as I do, they frequently meet prejudice.\"Indeed, for many Black people living in Hungary, the government’s anti-immigrant rhetoric plays out on an intimate level in their daily lives. They speak of verbal taunts, being turned away from restaurants and bars, trouble with neighbors and flatmates and difficulties finding work.Tobi Ojo was shocked when an older woman spat on him at a train station, days after he moved to Hungary from his native Nigeria in 2015. He was 16 at the time and about to begin a degree in electrical engineering at the University of Debrecen.\"I finally understood what it meant to be Black in a different place,\" Ojo said.Things got worse when he started looking for a job. A permit gave him seven months to find employment in Hungary — but even with top grades, he had no luck. A friend at an engineering firm where Ojo had applied for a job eventually told him in confidence, \"honestly they don't want any Black people in their company,\" Ojo recalled.Okwunwa, the communications student, said he regularly notices that people treat him with suspicion. He stopped going to IKEA after consistently being followed around the store by security guards, and moved out of one apartment because an older neighbor frequently called the police on him “for no reason,” complaining that his footsteps “were too loud.”Once, the neighbor reported a bomb threat when a friend temporarily left her luggage in the building’s lobby and Okwunwa returned home from class to find police searching his apartment.Both men have resigned themselves to ignoring the noises directed at them on the street. \"What can you possibly do?\" Okwunwa said. Both men also plan on leaving Hungary to pursue graduate degrees in countries where they believe they have more opportunities.Racism is not always overt, said Daniel Anyim, who came to CEU from Ghana in 2018. He occasionally notices Hungarians staring at him on the tram, but for the most part, he said, people approach African students with a \"live and let live\" attitude.Some African students say they live in a bubble of fellow international students, with whom they speak English, and rarely interact with locals.According to Tarrósy, attitudes are changing among younger generations, who are less likely to support anti-immigrant rhetoric and are also more aware of anti-racism movements in other countries thanks to social media.In university towns especially, many Hungarians realize that foreigners stimulate the local economies and add to their communities, Tarrósy said.For Ojo's part, the anti-racism protests in June have given him a sense of optimism for the future. \"It was definitely a great thing to see, knowing that it wasn't even a minority that organized it definitely breeds hope for the future.\"",
    "The Minnesota freshman and \"Squad\" member faces criticism that she’s too divisive to effectively represent her district.Rep. Ilhan Omar is one of the best-known Democrats from the class of 2018, a lightning-rod member of the Squad whose outspoken liberal politics have made her an enemy of Donald Trump.Back home in Minneapolis, however, her polarizing national profile is complicating her bid to win a second term.Facing a political newcomer who raised a jaw-dropping $3.2 million last quarter — much of it from pro-Israel donors who oppose Omar’s foreign policy stances — Omar suddenly finds herself on the defensive against claims that she’s too divisive to effectively represent the solidly Democratic district.“We don't need someone distracted with Twitter fights,” said primary challenger Antone Melton-Meaux, who pledges to focus on local issues and avoid the spotlight. “I don't want to be a celebrity. I want to serve the people, and people are tired of the politics of division and distraction.”The first Black Muslim woman to serve in Congress, Omar has built an image as a progressive champion who isn’t afraid to stand up to Trump. The president, in turn, has frequently singled out the freshman lawmaker, disparaging her as an anti-Semite, an “America-hating socialist” and falsely claiming that she publicly supports al Qaeda.A Somali refugee who is the first member of Congress to wear a hijab, Omar was attacked in xenophobic terms by Trump in 2019 when he encouraged her and other members of the Squad to “go back” to where they came from. As a result, supporters rallied around Omar in the district, which is the most strongly Democratic in the state.Yet many constituents have been alienated by her comments about Israel. Omar has been accused of anti-Semitism after suggesting support for Israel was popular due to campaign donations, that pro-Israel lawmakers had dual allegiance to both the U.S. and Israel and Israel had “hypnotized the world.”“Rep. Omar's past comments invoked age-old anti-Semitic tropes and rhetoric that echoed and brought about the nightmares of persecution,” said Rabbi Avi Olitzky, who leads a congregation in the district.Olitzky threw his support behind Melton-Meaux, who has spoken out about Omar’s comments about Israel, and said the challenger brings desperately needed conflict resolution skills to the political climate.University of Minnesota political scientist Larry Jacobs said Omar’s comments have infuriated the district’s small but influential Jewish community.“You've got an opponent who is playing on these divisions with resources to build his name recognition and take the fight to Omar,” Jacobs said. “Can she counter that with less money and with political skills that have not been impressive to this point?”A significant swath of the Fifth District’s Jewish community has an uneasy relationship with Omar, according to Steve Hunegs, the executive director of the Jewish Community Relations Council for Minnesota and the Dakotas. But Hunegs added the community is not monolithic and some progressive Jews are behind the incumbent.Omar voter Liz Loeb said as a Jewish person, she was hurt by Omar’s rhetoric, but does not think the lawmaker is anti-Semitic.“I need a representative that advocates for, and cares about and understands the experiences of people who are marginalized within communities,” Loeb said.Allies of the first-term lawmaker say Omar has reached out to the Jewish community and point to her apology in 2019. In a sign of her support from the national party establishment, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi endorsed Omar earlier this month — a year removed from Pelosi’s rebuke of the congresswoman.Omar is also backed by former Rep. Keith Ellison, who vacated the seat when he ran for Minnesota attorney general in 2018. Omar won an open, six-candidate primary that year with 48 percent of the vote and triumphed in the general election by nearly 60 percentage points.Still, pro-Israel bundlers are making her defeat a priority this cycle, angered by her support for the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement. And Melton-Meaux has been backed by pro-Israel PACs who oppose Omar’s foreign policy stances. A super PAC that backs America’s alliance with Israel is even starting to air Omar attack ads in the district.A previously little-known Black mediation lawyer, Melton-Meaux produced a second quarter fundraising haul that dwarfed Omar’s tally of $471,000.Omar allies like Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party Chairman Ken Martin criticized Melton-Meaux for receiving “big special interest money.”“You can judge someone’s values by where they're taking money from and who's fueling and funding their campaigns,” Martin said.Jeremy Slevin, Omar’s communications director, hit back at claims that Melton-Meaux is a unifier and criticized his past work as a corporate lawyer representing employers.“I feel pretty strongly that the image he is presenting in his primary challenge is bogus,” Slevin said.Slevin also took issue with Melton-Meaux’s casting of Omar as out of touch with her congressional district and in search of the limelight.“I think it's demeaning for someone to suggest that because a leader is subject to routinely racist and xenophobic attacks from the president, that they are therefore seeking celebrity,” Slevin said.Although Melton-Meaux’s substantial fundraising numbers catapulted him into contention for the seat that encompasses Minneapolis and its first-ring suburbs, Omar is still viewed as the favorite in the Aug. 11 primary.The congresswoman’s recent internal polling showed her leading Melton-Meaux 66 to 29 percent, with a 74 percent approval rating. The Melton-Meaux campaign blasted the poll as methodologically flawed but declined to share specifics from their own polling.Melton-Meaux said his message, which centers around criticizing Omar for her voting record and her controversial comments on Israel, is resonating.He called out Omar’s vote against the USMCA trade deal and present vote on a resolution condemning the Armenian genocide. And he ripped her for missing nearly 5 percent of votes during her first term.Martin, the DFL Party chairman, said he was confident Omar would win next month’s primary, backed by the state party’s support and what he said was a groundswell of voter mobilization following the police killing of George Floyd -- which occurred two miles from Melton-Meaux’s home.Melton-Meaux noted that the incident led him to reflect on his experiences with law enforcement. As a law student at the University of Virginia, Melton-Meaux said police detained him for a crime he did not commit.“I know without a shadow of a doubt, but for a few circumstances, that could have been a knee on my neck,” he said. “So to see former Officer Chauvin snuff out the life of George Floyd over eight and a half minutes in broad daylight in the city that I love was heartbreaking.”Minneapolis lawyer Don Lewis, who is endorsing Melton-Meaux, says his main issue with Omar isn’t her controversial comments on Israel, but her lack of connection with the district’s needs. Lewis, who is Black, said he views Melton-Meaux as an effective coalition builder whose background as a descendant of African enslaved people is meaningful.Melton-Meaux is betting on more voters like Minneapolis resident Pam Goldfarb Liss in order to win on Aug. 11. She supported Omar in 2018 and consistently votes the DFL party line. But now, she says she is voting for Melton-Meaux because she feels Omar is more concerned with fighting Trump than standing up for her constituents.“I would like to have a mild-mannered representative who builds bridges and gets things done for Minnesota instead,” Goldfarb Liss said.

    "Lawmakers say it could make meaningful change across government — but far more slowly than protesters would like.Amid a national reckoning on the injustices faced by Black Americans, Congress has so far agreed on just one response: Study the problem. The House this week approved a bill to create a first-of-its-kind federal commission to examine the impact of systemic racism on Black men and boys — a long-time priority of the Congressional Black Caucus that gained momentum after George Floyd’s death at the hands of police in May. The bill, which now goes to President Donald Trump’s desk after passing the Senate last month, is expected to become the first piece of legislation signed into law as a result of months of protests over police brutality. But some fear that it could be the last, at least until after the November election. “This is an important first step in the right direction,” House Democratic Caucus Chairman Hakeem Jeffries said in a brief interview after the bill passed Monday. “Much more will need to be done, consistent with the bills that have already been acted upon by the House.” Democrats and Republicans have hailed the 19-member commission as a long-overdue way to begin tackling decades of lingering racism toward Black men, starting with policy recommendations across the government. The group, hand-picked by leaders in Congress and the administration, would look broadly at disparities on everything from incarceration rates and drug abuse to school performance and health. Many lawmakers acknowledge that the legislation isn’t enough to address protesters’ demands for an immediate overhaul of the nation’s law enforcement practices. But with Republican leaders resisting Democratic proposals for broad reforms, the commission is likely to be the most far-reaching policy to go into effect in the coming months.Still, the legislation could have a long-term impact. “It’s a very progressive and aggressive bill,” Rep. Frederica Wilson (D-Fla.), the bill’s long-time champion, said in an interview, adding that it’s intended to look at the deep-rooted effects of racism in the lives of Black men and boys, and not just policing. It would be housed within the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights. “When people approach a Black boy on the street, they cross the street. If a Black man gets in an elevator, people get off,” Wilson said. “All of these systemic racist scenarios as it relates to being a Black man and existing in America make me want to scream.” Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), who shepherded the bill on the Senate side, said the forum created to discuss these issues “could turn out to be very meaningful.”“People will look at commissions and kind of roll their eyes,” he added. “But the various factors that are contributing to the academic, economic, societal underperformance, typically among African American boys and men, needs to be better understood.” The commission, while an accomplishment for a Congress that seems to agree on little these days, is a far cry from the sweeping changes lawmakers in both chambers were pursuing in June, as the nationwide racial injustice protests dominated the news.But that momentum quickly came to a halt after the Senate failed to advance a bill in late June — likely dooming any meaningful action on police reform until after the election or next year. Once again, a Congress that only seems to function when facing a deadline-fueled crisis, failed to answer the calls of Americans demanding change. While protesters are still in the streets of many major cities, lawmakers have quickly pivoted to the next looming crisis — in this case, the latest coronavirus rescue package. But even that effort is sputtering as Senate Republicans continue to bicker over their own proposal and the parties remain far apart.  Democrats say key lawmakers, led by CBC Chairwoman Karen Bass, are privately still trying to enact more sweeping police reforms after this summer’s stalemate. But several lawmakers and aides are skeptical that a bipartisan agreement can be reached and signed into law anytime soon. In the meantime, the House and Senate have turned to a less contentious option — the commission — which was opposed by just a single lawmaker in both chambers: GOP Rep. Mo Brooks of Alabama. Wilson, the bill’s original author, said she hopes the council will focus on some of the issues addressed in the House Democrats’ policing bill, like the use of chokeholds by police. The CBC would likely have power over the direction of the commission, given that a half-dozen of its members, including its chair, would sit on the panel.The House’s sweeping policing bill, named after George Floyd, sought to end racial profiling in law enforcement and curb the use of force through provisions like a ban on chokeholds and “no-knock” warrants, stronger data collection on misconduct, and limits on the use of military equipment. Senate Republicans, meanwhile, had written a bill to incentivize local police departments to refrain from tactics like chokeholds, but without strict requirements. That bill, largely drafted by the GOP’s lone Black senator, Tim Scott of South Carolina, was ultimately blocked by Senate Democrats, who said it was crafted without their input and didn’t go anywhere near far enough.  Wilson, a former school administrator, has spearheaded the idea of a commission on Black men and boys since her days on the Miami-Dade county school board nearly 30 years ago. Eventually, she took her fight to the state legislature and helped enact a state-wide model with the help of Republicans like Rubio, who was then speaker of the Florida House. This year, Rubio introduced the companion version of Wilson’s bill alongside Sens. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) and Cory Booker (D-N.J.). It was unanimously approved by the Senate in late June, shortly after the Senate GOP’s police reform efforts collapsed. The House passed its version of the commission bill on July 27, the same day that the late Rep. John Lewis — who had also long advocated for the measure — lay in state in the Capitol Rotunda. “For me, it was like an out of body experience that this bill was passing as John was being transported to lie in state in the Capitol,” Wilson said. “It was a chilling confluence of events.”Marianne Levine contributed to this report.",
    "The weekend's unrest stemmed from the weeks of protests over racial injustice and the police treatment of people of color.Protests took a violent turn in several U.S. cities over the weekend with demonstrators squaring off against federal agents outside a courthouse in Portland, Oregon, forcing police in Seattle to retreat into a station house and setting fire to vehicles in California and Virginia.A protest against police violence in Austin, Texas, turned deadly when police said a protester was shot and killed by a person who drove through a crowd of marchers. And someone was shot and wounded in Aurora, Colorado, after a car drove through a protest there, authorities said.The unrest Saturday and early Sunday stemmed from the weeks of protests over racial injustice and the police treatment of people of color that flared up after the May 25 death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Floyd, who was Black and handcuffed, died after a white police officer used his knee to pin down Floyd's neck for nearly eight minutes while Floyd begged for air.In Seattle, police officers retreated into a precinct station early Sunday, hours after large demonstrations in the city’s Capitol Hill neighborhood. Some demonstrators lingered after officers filed into the department’s East Precinct around 1 a.m., but most cleared out a short time later, according to video posted online.At a late-night news conference, Seattle police Chief Carmen Best called for peace. Rocks, bottles, fireworks and mortars were fired at police during the weekend unrest, and police said they arrested at least 45 people for assaults on officers, obstruction and failure to disperse. Twenty-one officers were hurt, with most of their injuries considered minor, police said.In Portland, thousands of people gathered Saturday evening for another night of protests over George Floyd’s killing and the presence of federal agents recently sent to the city by President Donald Trump. Protesters breached a fence surrounding the city’s federal courthouse building where the agents have been stationed.Police declared the situation to be a riot and at around 1:20 a.m., they began ordering people to leave the area surrounding the courthouse or risk arrest, saying on Twitter that the violence had created “a grave risk” to the public. About 20 minutes later, federal officers and local police could be seen attempting to clear the area and deploying tear gas, however protesters remained past 2:30 a.m., forming lines across intersections and holding makeshift shields as police patrolled and closed blocks abutting the area. Multiple arrests were made, but it wasn’t immediately clear how many.In the Texas capital of Austin, 28-year-old Garrett Foster was shot and killed Saturday night by a person who had driven through the march against police violence.Austin Police Chief Brian Manley said a car turned onto the block where protesters stood and honked its horn. The driver and several witnesses told police that Foster approached the driver and pointed an assault rifle at them.In video streamed live on Facebook, a car can be heard honking before several shots ring out and protesters start screaming and scattering for cover. Police could then be seen tending to someone lying in the street.Manley said the driver called 911 to report the incident and was later taken into custody and released. Police didn’t immediately identify the driver.Sheila Foster, Garrett's mother, said she was told her son was pushing his fiancée, who uses a wheelchair, through an intersection when the suspect was driving “erratically” through the crowd. She said she was told the driver shot her son three times.In the Denver suburb of Aurora, Colorado, meanwhile, a protester shot and wounded someone after a car drove through a crowd marching on an interstate highway, police said. The wounded person was taken to a hospital in stable condition. Police didn’t release many details about the shooting, including whether the person who was shot had been in the car. Police said on Twitter that demonstrators also caused “major damage” to a courthouse.Protesters in Oakland, California, set fire to a courthouse, damaged a police station, broke windows, spray-painted graffiti, shot fireworks and pointed lasers at officers after a peaceful demonstration Saturday evening turned to unrest, police said.In Virginia's capital, Richmond, a dump truck was torched as several hundred protesters and police faced off late Saturday during a demonstration of support for the protesters in Portland. Police declared it to be an “unlawful assembly” at around 11 p.m. and used what appeared to be tear gas to disperse the group. Five people were arrested in the incident and charged with unlawful assembly. A sixth person was also arrested and charged with rioting and assault on a law enforcement officer.In downtown Atlanta on Sunday, federal agents examined damage to an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility where windows were shattered late Saturday. The FBI and the Department of Homeland Security, FBI spokesman Kevin Rowson said in an email. No arrests had been announced.And in Baltimore, people from a group of nearly 100 demonstrators spray-painted anti-police messages on a Fraternal Order of Police building and adjacent sidewalks on Saturday night, The Baltimore Sun reported.",
    "Conservatives are using images of Black protesters with guns to justify their calls for law and order. When coronavirus lockdowns spread nationwide in March, millions of Americans flocked to their local grocery stores and wholesale markets to stock up for what would become months stuck at home. Black Americans did the same, but some had one addendum to their shopping list: a firearm. Since the beginning of the pandemic, there has been growing interest among African Americans in arming themselves, as evidenced by increased membership in Black gun owner organizations. That interest ballooned in the wake of George Floyd’s death, which reignited debate about public safety and the role of police in Black communities. Sensationalized stereotypes about Black Americans and guns, however, are also being used by critics of the anti-racism protests to justify a security crackdown in urban areas, many with large Black communities. The rush to purchase weapons and ammunition is not unique to one race — more Americans across the board are arming themselves this year, including those who are not legally eligible. However, new Black gun owners see firearms as a tool of both empowerment and self-defense. Philip Smith, president of the National African American Gun Owners’ Association, said his organization’s annual membership has increased by much as 2,000 new members per day — a figure he used to see annually. His organization has grown to more than 30,000 members this year and has an online following of nearly 90,000 people.The influx of interest in gun owning — and seeking membership in Black gun owner organizations — began as soon as the pandemic set in. Fears of a damaged economy, disrupted supply chain and slow-moving federal response inspired people to take up arms. \"If you have a half a brain in your head even saying, 'Oh, this might get serious, let me plan accordingly,\" Smith explained.The Floyd protests, he added, were a “line in the sand” for many of his new members. Leaders of other Black gun ownership organizations echo this response, saying the spike owes to a range of concerns many Black Americans have.\"Whether it was fear of a food shortage, lack of a grocery store, the short response times for law enforcement or whether people were just fearful they were going to be attacked, I don't know,\" said Derrick Morgan, national commander of the Black Gun Owners Association. Morgan said interest in his group grew so quickly that his website crashed from a surge in online traffic.\"A lot of people are reaching out to us, mainly new gun owners and people who wouldn't have considered owning a gun or firearm for their protection, have been lining up to purchase firearms and access information from our website.\"Their reasoning has become much harder to ignore, especially as social media sites and phone videos turned into tools of capturing and responding to instances of police brutality. Floyd’s death catalyzed international protest in part for this reason. The video of Ahmaud Arbery, who was killed by white vigilantes in a Georgia suburb garnered similar levels of attention, as did that of Atlanta’s Rayshard Brooks, who was shot in the back by a police officer after a confrontation. While the vast majority of demonstrators across the U.S. this summer have been unarmed, some have sought to make a statement with their guns. In Stone Mountain, Ga., an open carry state, at least 150 African Americans asserted their Second Amendment Right as a tool of protest. Dressed in black and armed with semi-automatic rifles, the group marched through Stone Mountain Park to protest its depiction of Confederate generals. A similar march organized by black gun owners took place in Oklahoma City in June, timed to President Donald Trump’s rally in nearby Tulsa. Smith said his organization is not affiliated with such groups but empathizes with their members.“Any time any community has been pushed and pushed like ours has been pushed, I may not agree with what you do as another organization, but I certainly understand where that stems from,” he said, adding that the groups' efforts were done out of “survival and being able to protect your community.”Their demonstration and others have drawn the ire of some conservatives. Georgia Sen. Kelly Loeffler decried the “mob rule” in Atlanta during a June 24 interview on Fox News, as the cable network played images of Black protesters carrying semi-automatic weapons. “We’re a nation of the rule of law and this is exactly what will happen if we defund the police,” Loeffler warned.Her rhetoric echoes that of the White House and other Republicans in Washington, who have taken an increasingly antagonistic tone towards protesters and members of the Black Lives Matter movement over the past month.Trump has referred to the movement as a \"hate group\" and repeated talking points in favor of tough policing. The president and his supporters, meanwhile, defended a white St. Louis couple captured on video pointing guns at Black protesters marching by. According to Fox News, the couple told police they retrieved their firearms after spotting armed protesters.Other members of his circle have taken to calling Black Lives Matter protesters \"Marxists\" who have been \"planning to destroy the police for years.\"Attempts to fan fears of armed, militant Black Americans is not a new political tactic. In 1969, FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover described the Black Panther Party, which advocated for African Americans to take up guns as a form of self-defense, as \"the greatest threat to internal security of the country.\" Concerns about the group in the late 1960s even prompted the National Rifle Association, no fan of gun restrictions, to partner with California Gov. Ronald Reagan to pass gun control legislation that limited open carry at the state capitol.Now, as the Trump administration prepares to expand its military presence to major cities, their talking points are turning into policy. After a week of violent crackdowns on protests in Portland, President Trump announced his plans to deploy hundreds of federal law enforcement agents to Chicago and Albuquerque to “help drive down violent crime.” The federal government has also threatened to deploy federal forces in Baltimore, Detroit, New York, Oakland and Philadelphia — all of which have large Black populations.The White House has specifically cited gun violence in African American communities and the threat of damage to federal property as an excuse for the increased military presence. Black gun owners of this era, however, maintain that their firearm ownership is not evidence of something more sinister, nor is it the violent show of force that some conservatives have made it out to be. “It’s my constitutional freaking right,” said Kat Traylor, a political strategist and licensed gun owner based in Aurora, Colo., the site of one of the most violent mass shootings in American history. Traylor said she feels empowered by owning a firearm. At the same time, she is a member of the Moms Demand Action group, which advocates for gun control legislation. In 2018, she helped push through the state’s Red Flag Law that gives judges the power to seize a person’s firearm if they prove to be a danger to themselves or another person. “We tussled with the idea of having guns in our home because we've advocated so many gun rights legislation,” she explained. “We were like, yeah, we need this law because we don't need guns in the hands of people that are clearly going to hurt themselves or others.”Traylor is not the only person who has struggled with the implications of owning a gun as a Black American. With shootings on the rise in several American cities, advocates are wary of the trend, saying there isn’t enough evidence to prove that guns will make Black Americans safer.“What I really want people to think about is the impact of the presence of guns in Black communities and how there are inherent challenges and more nuanced challenges to saying ‘everyone should arm themselves,” said Amber Goodwin, founder and executive director of the Community Justice Action Fund, which aims to prevent gun violence in communities of color. “Not everyone has access to gun safety. We don't know how guns can actually make Black people safer in the home or outside of the home.”Black gun ownership advocates, who prioritize safety and proper training over rushed and potentially dangerous efforts to obtain weapons, say their growth in numbers sends a powerful message beyond those from Stone Mountain, Oklahoma City, Aurora or any individual city. “The days are over of African Americans sitting around singing Kumbaya and hoping and praying that somebody will come and save them. We're gonna save ourselves,” Smith said. “And any politician that wants our vote moving forward, they better be on the side of our thinking otherwise, you're not gonna get our vote. We're not gonna be sheep anymore.”",
    "Court rejects bid by Oregon AG to require feds to identify themselves before whisking suspects from city streets.A judge on Friday denied the Oregon attorney general's request for a temporary restraining order to rein in the activities of federal agents responding to protests and unrest in Portland. As part of a lawsuit against federal agents in the city, Oregon Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum had requested that federal officers clearly identify themselves when seizing protesters and stop arrests without probable cause. But U.S. District Court Judge Michael Mosman rejected the motion, arguing that she did not present enough evidence that future harm would continue at the hands of the agents. The judge also raised doubts about whether the state had legal standing to pursue a suit on behalf of protesters or others who might be targeted by the federal officers.The decision comes a day after another federal judge ruled in a separate case that federal agents would have to stop using force on journalists reporting on the protests.Federal agents from the Department of Homeland Security and the U.S. Marshals Service arrived in Portland as protesters marched on the city in the wake of George Floyd's death. Several reports and videos shared on social media showed agents clad in camouflage seizing activists from city streets and whisking the protesters away in unmarked vehicles. The agents also reportedly used force on journalists to clear them from protest areas.Videos of the agents show the uniforms are clearly marked as \"POLICE\" but activists say it is often unclear what agency the armed officers represent. The military gear and attire evokes fear and suspicion, critics say. The agents appear to be part of what court filings have described as a \"rapid deployment force\" that is part of \"Operation Diligent Valor,\" a Department of Homeland Security-led effort to protect federal courthouses and office buildings from vandalism, arson and other damage.Last week, Rosenblum sued the agents, listed as John Doe 1-10, and a number of federal agencies, accusing them of violating protesters' constitutional rights by arresting them without probable cause. David Morrell, an attorney for the federal government, argued before the court that Rosenblum's motion for a temporary restraining order was based on \"a few thread witnesses and a Twitter video.\"In a 14-page ruling Friday, Mosman wrote that Rosenblum's case was a \"highly unusual\" one that does not meet the standards for a temporary restraining order, particularly for barring future conduct rather than harm already done to protesters. Mosman wrote that Rosenblum only used two examples of what she characterizes as unlawful seizures and did not present enough evidence that the seizures are likely to continue.\"The State could try to show, for example, that all of Defendants’ seizures are illegal, or that they are under orders to fail to identify themselves or to make random arrests without probable cause,\" Mosman wrote. \"The state has shown none of this. It has presented no evidence of any official orders or policies and has presented no evidence that these allegedly illegal seizures are a widespread practice.\"Mosman also faulted the state’s lawyers for hyperbolic arguments, including describing those arrested as being “disappeared,” which the judge said evoked the mass murder of tens of thousands of political opponents by a military junta in Argentina in the 1970s and 1980s.“Even taking every word of the State’s arguments and evidence at face value, this seems out of proportion,” wrote Mosman, an appointee of President George W. Bush.Rosenblum later issued a statement pushing back on Mosman's doubts on the state's ability to sue on behalf of the protesters. Protesters can sue for individual damages, she said, but cannot sue to stop what she called the unlawful conduct of federal agents in the future.\"Today’s ruling suggests that there may be no recourse on behalf of our state, and if so that is extremely troubling,\" Rosenblum said.She added: \"While today the court declined to issue an immediate order putting a stop to those tactics, we are, nevertheless, hopeful these abuses will stop and no other Oregonians will be subject to them or to the chilling effect they have on the right to engage in peaceful protest.\"Mosman's order came hours after the Justice Department announced federal charges against 18 protesters in connection to demonstrations at a federal courthouse in Portland. Those charges included assaults on law enforcement officers, destruction of property, looting, arson, and vandalism. Late Friday, another federal judge blocked Seattle’s new law prohibiting police from using pepper spray, blast balls and similar weapons that was passed following confrontations with protesters, according to the Associated Press.The Seattle Times reports that U.S. District Judge James Robart at an emergency hearing granted a request from the federal government to block the new law, which the Seattle City Council passed unanimously last month.The U.S. Department of Justice, citing Seattle’s longstanding police consent decree, argued that banning the use of crowd control weapons could actually lead to more police use of force, leaving them only with more deadly weapons.Josh Gerstein contributed to this report.",
    "The bill, passed by the Legislature earlier this week, also bans chokeholds and so-called warrior-style training.ST. PAUL, Minn. — Gov. Tim Walz is expected to sign a police accountability bill into law Thursday that includes a ban on neck restraints like the one that was used on George Floyd before his death in Minneapolis.The bill, passed by the Legislature earlier this week, also bans chokeholds and so-called warrior-style training, which critics say promotes excessive force. It imposes a duty to intercede on officers who see a colleague using excessive force.The bill also changes rules on the use of force to stress the sanctity of life and makes changes in arbitration rules affecting police unions.Officers will get more training on dealing with people with mental health issues and autism. The measure also creates a new advisory council for the state board that licenses officers.Passage of the bill came after nearly two months of difficult negotiations that followed Floyd’s death May 25 and the ensuing unrest that spread around the world over police brutality and racism.The Black man was restrained face down in the street while handcuffed and with three officers holding him down, including a white officer who had a knee to Floyd’s neck for nearly eight minutes.",
    "Small non-state outlets are building a community of like-minded progressives among young Chinese people and challenging the state’s grip on coverage of the United States and the world.On June 21, a new podcast appeared on several Chinese and American podcast platforms, including Apple Podcasts. Called In-Betweenness, it was recorded by four academics scattered around the world.The podcast is in Mandarin, and the target audience is Chinese people, but the topic was race in America and across the world—specifically, what’s happening to race relations in the wake of the George Floyd protests. The hosts, based in the United States, Asia and Europe, didn’t shy away from difficult issues. They started the conversation with how Chinese people were characterized as “yellow” in a world order that still favors white Europeans, and ended it with a look at anti-Black racism in China.Some listeners complained that the first episode was “too theoretical and abstract”—the discussion touched on the French philosopher Frantz Fanon’s criticism of Hegel’s master-slave dialectic—but that didn’t prevent people from tuning in. Since it launched, the podcast has racked up 17,000 downloads in eight countries plus Taiwan and Hong Kong. That might seem a drop in the bucket relative to the 1 billion Mandarin speakers worldwide, but the podcast’s goal isn’t to go mainstream. Instead, it aims to open up space for progressive conversation and build community among a select group of Chinese-speaking people, highly educated and many of them young, who might go on to have influence over politics and policy. Over 60 percent of the audience is in China. “I wasn’t surprised by the geographical distribution of our audience,” says Chenchen Zhang, a co-host of In-Betweenness who teaches politics and international relations at Queen’s University Belfast. “But I was a bit surprised by the number of downloads.” In-Betweenness marks a new trend in the Chinese media landscape. All media in China, state and commercial, is closely monitored and heavily censored pre- and post-publishing. Under publishing laws and regulations, nonstate digital media is not allowed to conduct original reporting and publishing. At best, they are aggregators. State censorship of social media platforms such as WeChat and Weibo, now the primary news sources in China, has become increasingly sophisticated. The state has also cracked down on private software to circumvent the Great Firewall.But a wave of independent Chinese-language media platforms, based mostly outside of China—podcasts like In-Betweenness, as well as blogs, newsletters and video series—has sprung up in recent years to cover America and the world for a Chinese-speaking audience. Most of the audience are educated millennials living in cities in China and abroad, and most of the platforms can be accessed anywhere in the world, including China. Even if some episodes are removed by government censors from podcast stores in China, people can still access it by subscribing to RSS feeds.In the increasingly fraught relationship between China and the United States, these new projects amount to a kind of third information channel, one neither controlled by the Chinese state nor the America-centric Western media in English. It includes In-Betweenness; the podcasts Loud Murmurs, Stochastic Volatility and New York Culture Salon; News Lab, a newsletter run by Kecheng Fang, a journalism professor based in Hong Kong; and an independent blog run by Yan Wang, a conservative-turned-liberal popular blogger who has been writing about systemic racism on WeChat, the Chinese social-media app, for years. The unrest following George Floyd’s killing has given these new outlets a new topic of huge interest to Chinese listeners: race in America. In part, the interest was fanned by Chinese state media, which tends to dramatize America’s domestic strife. As the protests grew in late spring and early summer, Chinese media portrayed a chaotic, hypocritical United States with vivid images of tumult and police violence. But these new outlets portrayed something different—a more balanced picture of race relations, a diagnosis of root causes that went beyond a two-tiered U.S. legal system and extended to global cultural and racial dynamics. If their coverage of the George Floyd protests is a sign of what’s to come, these independent Chinese media outlets could play a crucial role in demystifying, or more fully explaining, U.S. politics and culture for a select Chinese audience. They might even set the tone for a clearer, more open cultural relationship between the two countries, even as foreign-policy tensions between them boil over.To Americans who have never seen their own country covered overseas, it can be shocking to see the way some Chinese media portray it.Take HBO’s removal of the movie “Gone with the Wind” as an example. After HBO briefly took down the film in early June because of its problematic portrayal of people of color, Chinese media—official and unofficial—blew the story up into such a hot-button national controversy that many in China think the United States is having its own Cultural Revolution, all triggered by one movie. (In reality, the network put it back online in a week.) One headline read “American Cultural Revolution: Ridiculous and Unfortunate, Gone with the Wind Got Pulled.” Another used a militant phrase popular during the Cultural Revolution, qingsuan, meaning eradicating crimes, to describe the removal of the Civil War drama.To address this kind of inaccurate coverage of U.S. social dynamics, the newer independent media platforms have built their influence over the past few years among open-minded, liberal Chinese people home and abroad. Quite a few were already influencers on Chinese social media—Weibo and WeChat—before starting their own media products. The creators are academics, journalists, lawyers and activists trained in Western universities, attracted to liberal democratic ideals, and critical of both China’s party state and Western exceptionalism. On the American political spectrum, they’d be considered progressive. And they offer a perspective—critical of both the U.S. and China—that’s rarely seen in the mainland discourse.“What they do is very important because progressive values barely had any space on the Chinese internet before,” says Fang, a journalism professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong who studies Chinese media. In his view, their role isn’t to shift broader Chinese public attitudes, but “to cater to a highly educated crowd who already hold similar political values and then to influence a minority of others who are open-minded and willing to be challenged.” They want to challenge the isolationist worldview from both China and the United States, and signal with their content as well as their distribution that globalization is here to stay.Today, this transnational treatment of the news means translating the Black Lives Matter movement for a group of people who may be curious about the movement’s aims in the U.S., and also willing to acknowledge that anti-Black racism is far from a uniquely American problem. People in China following the story exclusively through state media may lack all that context. Analysts say it’s not uncommon for Chinese readers to regard the whole uprising with shock and disapproval; some make racist comments of their on social media and in comments sections of news stories online. “When social movements, such as Black Lives Matter, erupt, because of their oversimplified view of racism, they tend to misunderstand what the protesters want,” Yao Lin, an In-Betweenness cohost, says, “and some of them tend to stand with white supremacists and the status quo.”Many of these new independent media platforms offer a different way to see the protests in the United States. These new media outlets have explained to their audiences what racism in the United States is, and why the Chinese should pay attention to anti-Black racism. And they have also done what would be unthinkable for institutional Chinese media: They have turned a critical lens back on China itself, pointing to the rising racism against Africans in Guangzhou during the Covid-19 outbreak, when many were evicted from their apartments from landlords or turned away from hotels. “Racial discrimination can be relevant even to those in China because they can draw a parallel between systematic racism and discriminations against women, sexual minorities and migrant workers, which are more common in China,” says Zhicheng Zhao, founder of New York Culture Salon. Loud Murmurs, a Mandarin podcast focused on American pop culture, is planning a three-episode series in light of the Black Lives Matter movement unfolding in the United States, where the show’s hosts live. For their upcoming episode, they invited two Black men, one of whom is an African immigrant who’s been educated in the West and in China, the other an African American who works in China, to discuss how Hollywood portrays Blackness, how those portrayals are received in China and their personal experience with racism in China.To address the misunderstanding that the United States is having its own Cultural Revolution, for instance, Loud Murmurs had their two Black guests talk about political correctness and how classic American movies portrayed slavery through rose-tinted glasses. “We understand that conversation. We are plugged in to it,” says Isabelle Niu, a co-host of Loud Murmurs. “And so we can offer our own insight and analysis on how this should be interpreted.”Some of the new outlets are also focusing on these conversations to tackle popular conservative Chinese arguments on Black Lives Matter and claim space in an information environment filled with increasingly nationalistic voices, which is engineered by pervasive censorship, propaganda and misinformation. Yan Wang, the WeChat blogger, appeals to his audience by recounting his experience of confronting and overcoming his own racism over the years, alongside his analysis of racial segregation. The San Francisco-based software engineer has been active in debating online with older, more conservative Chinese immigrants about stereotypes they commonly hold about Black people.Based on his experience so far, he doesn’t foresee swaying many people’s opinions. “I have been trying to communicate with conservatives, and it’s been largely an attempt in vain,” Wang says. “Because what I say makes most of them extremely uncomfortable, and they don’t always make rational arguments.”His goal, Wang says, is to educate those who are already interested in social justice and politics, who can, hopefully, in the future influence other Chinese Americans, who have a reputation for being less politically engaged than other minority groups in the United States.These media platforms aren’t just liberal enclaves providing reporting and analysis for their audiences; they have also been trying to have conversations with people in real life. New York Culture Salon, a nonprofit organization that holds weekly seminars and releases them in podcast or video form, wanted to respond to how the social unrest in the United States has divided generations of Chinese immigrants and social media chat groups in China. The nonprofit has organized a six-week panel series devoted to the Black Lives Matter movement. They invited young Chinese scholars who study law, activism and immigration in the U.S. to participate in broadcast panel discussions. The speakers tackled topics that might be perceived as elementary by American intellectuals, such as the historical role of violence in pushing for progress, why Chinese people should support Black Lives Matter and how systemic racism is embedded in U.S. institutions. More than 3,000 people from in and outside of China attended the first two webinars.Such platforms often have a tenuous relationship with Chinese censors. They are not high-profile enough to be erased from the Chinese internet completely. But once their content has gained steam on Chinese social media, especially on what are deemed sensitive political issues, they draw the attention of government censors.Loud Murmurs and New York Culture Salon have both had their content, social media posts and platforms censored for touching domestic political topics, such as China’s controversial one-child-per-family policy. Their core audiences followed them as they moved their content to platforms untouched by Chinese censors, usually domains registered abroad. And for some of the podcasts in this new wave, talking about politics in foreign countries only—for instance, about the Black Lives Matter movement—shields them from censorship.“With pervasive censorship, we can only relieve political depression by focusing on the events unfolding across the Pacific,” says China-based Shiye Fu, a co-host of Stochastic Volatility, who has a degree in anthropology from Columbia University.None of the people I talked to for the story expect their content to attract a mainstream audience. But they hope the small audience they have connected with will connect with other Chinese speakers and go on to create something much larger than podcasts. “We got a lot of comments like, ‘Wow. I’ve never heard four women talk about politics in a way that’s so uninhibited,” Niu says. “I think just the idea that you can express yourself without fear, even that is very encouraging to people.”",
    " The state's lawsuit is part of a growing pushback against the Trump administration's use of federal agents against protesters. PORTLAND, Ore. — Attorneys for Oregon argued Wednesday for a restraining order against federal agents deployed to quell protests in Portland, in a standoff that some legal experts have warned could lead to a constitutional crisis in an election year.A federal judge heard the state's and the U.S. government's arguments in a lawsuit filed by Oregon Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum, who accuses federal agents of arresting protesters without probable cause, whisking them away in unmarked cars and using excessive force to quell the unrest. Federal authorities have disputed that.The lawsuit is part of a growing pushback against the Trump administration's use of federal agents in Portland and its plans to do the same in other cities that is deepening the country’s already considerable political divides. Democratic mayors of 15 cities — including Portland and cities where President Donald Trump has sent or threatened to send federal forces — condemned the use of the agents in a letter to the attorney general.The hearing Wednesday focused on the actions of more than 100 federal agents responding to protests outside the the city's Mark O. Hatfield Federal Courthouse, which has been a target for more than 50 nights of demonstrations against racial injustice following the killing of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police.The motion for a temporary restraining order asks U.S. District Court Judge Michael Mosman to command agents from the Department of Homeland Security, the U.S. Customs and Border Patrol, the Federal Protective Service and the U.S. Marshals Service to immediately stop detaining protesters without probable cause, to identify themselves and their agency before arresting anyone, and to explain why an arrest is taking place.During the hearing — held by videoconference because of the coronavirus pandemic — the state acknowledged during the hearing that the federal agents have the right to defend the courthouse, which is federal property, but argued they had overstepped that role.Rosenblum, the state attorney general, said she was asking the court to “declare it not acceptable for federal officers to use unconstitutional, police state-type acts to detain citizens of Oregon without cause.”David Morrell, an attorney for the U.S. government, called the motion “extraordinary” and told the court it was based solely on “a few threadbare declarations” from witnesses and a Twitter video.“It’s important to underscore what’s at stake here. The Hatfield courthouse did not damage itself,” he said, calling the protests “dangerous and volatile.”It's not clear when Mosman will rule, but he challenged the state on whether it had the proper standing to ask for the restraining order on behalf of all Oregonians. The judge noted that past legal decisions have required a state to establish a very high bar — “quasi-sovereign interest” — in order to successfully sue the U.S. government.Attorneys for Oregon contended they had met that bar because the actions of the federal agents could erode Oregonians' trust in all law enforcement, including state and city officers.But Morrell, the U.S. government attorney, disputed that, saying successful suits usually involved issues that affected many people, not “highly individual interests,” like the arrests.The suit is one of several filed over law enforcement's response to the Portland protests. On Thursday, a judge will hear arguments in a lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union on behalf of journalists and legal observers who say they were targeted and attacked by police while documenting demonstrations. A freelance photographer covering the protests for The Associated Press submitted an affidavit that he was beaten with batons, chemical irritants and hit with rubber bullets.U.S. Judge Michael Simon previously ruled that journalists and legal observers are exempt from Portland police orders requiring protesters to disperse once an area has been declared an unlawful assembly. Federal lawyers say in court filings that journalists should have to leave when ordered to do so.The Trump administration also faces another lawsuit, accusing federal agents of violating protesters’ 10th Amendment rights by engaging in police activities designated to local and state governments.Ahead of Wednesday’s hearing, a fence was raised around Portland's federal courthouse, at which protesters and federal agents had clashed again overnight, according to police. Protesters repeatedly tried to break into the courthouse and set fires around it, and the federal agents drove them back with tear gas and stun grenades, the police said.Far from tamping down the unrest in Portland, the presence of federal agents on the streets of the progressive city has recently energized the nightly protests. Crowds had numbered fewer than 100 people but swelled to more than 1,000 over the weekend as outrage over the use of federal forces appeared to unite Portlanders.More broadly, the use of federal agents against the wishes of state and local officials — and the threat that it might be done elsewhere — was deepening the country’s already considerable political divides and potentially setting up a constitutional crisis months ahead of the presidential election. The standoff could escalate if Trump sends federal agents elsewhere, as he says he plans to do, including to Chicago.The mayors of Chicago, Portland and 13 other Democrat-led cities called the deployment unconstitutional and alleged it was being done for political purposes in a letter to Attorney General William Barr and Department of Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf.“The president and his administration continually attack local leadership and amplify false and divisive rhetoric purely for campaign fodder,” the mayors wrote.Federal authorities, however, have defended their response, saying officials in Oregon had been unwilling to work with them to stop the vandalism against the the U.S. courthouse and violence against federal officers.Wolf told a news conference Tuesday in Washington that agents have been assaulted with lasers, bats, fireworks, bottles and other weapons. While he said federal agencies have made 43 arrests since July 4, he disputed that they were done by unidentified agents, noting that they have the word “police” on their uniforms.Among the protesters this week was Maureen Healy, who joined a march Monday with a family member, as demonstrators sang songs, chanted the names of Black lives lost and held moments of silence.Just after midnight, she saw a line of authorities wearing camouflage and dark outfits emerge and advance on the crowd. The crowd retreated, and Healy said she heard bangs, saw smoke and was struck by a projectile as she turned away. She went to the hospital with a black eye, cut to her face and a possible concussion.“This is my home. I was protesting peacefully so why did federal troops shoot me in the head?” asked Healy, 52, who is the chair of the History Department at Lewis & Clark College.",
    "\"We don't need someone in the Senate or House to try to build their political career off of this moment.\"In 2015, thousands of Black activists gathered in Ohio for the first national Black Lives Matter convention to consider where the movement would direct its energy.Attendees in the crowd held up red construction paper to signal “no” to a handful of narrow options, like focusing only on policy or on organizing demonstrations. But then, the activists were asked what they thought about an all-of-the-above, “multi-tactical” approach encompassing everything from organizing and protesting to pushing new legislation at various levels of government.“It was a sea of green,” said Ash-Lee Woodard Henderson, co-executive director of the Highlander Research and Education Center and one of many leaders in the Movement for Black Lives coalition. The democratic nature of the vote, and the broad vision it endorsed, illustrate a key, intentional detail about the Black Lives Matter movement that has baffled some outsiders: It doesn’t have a typical power structure — and it doesn’t want to, as it wages battle on multiple fronts. Instead of a pyramid of different departments topped by a leader, there is coordination and a set of shared values spread across a decentralized structure that prizes local connections and fast mobilization in response to police violence. Over the last eight years, the movement has steadily built a modern infrastructure on top of decades-old social justice institutions like the Highlander Center. The distributed setup has at times contributed to tensions. National Black activists have feuded over which policy programs put forward by different organizations best represent the goals of the movement. Some admitted the decentralized system can confuse the public at times and leave the movement open to misconceptions in the press. But none of the 10 activists POLITICO spoke to from across the country said they wanted a hierarchical structure instead, as the movement seeks to turn its newfound momentum into policy changes at the local and national levels. “There were explicit decisions around building the movement in a way that would be both coordinated and decentralized,” said Maurice Mitchell, national director of the Working Families Party and an organizer with the Movement for Black Lives. “There's no way that you could have these many actions with the same demand if there wasn't a level of high level coordination.” When George Floyd’s killing at the hands of a white Minneapolis police officer was captured on film, hundreds of organizations and thousands of activists were ready to launch protests in their cities. They pushed policy with local legislators and police departments and rallied people who hadn't previously engaged in BLM protests around the message of “defund the police.”The growing, multiracial movement has quickly shifted the conversation around policing and racism across the country, including in Washington, where lawmakers have been unsure how to react or liaise with the groundswell. There is no chairperson or candidate calling the shots in private or serving as a public rallying point. With no singular person to attack in tweets, President Donald Trump instead directed his ire and threats of violence at mostly peaceful protesters. “In terms of strategy — and this is very real that we have to be honest about this — it makes it harder for those who are against us to do what they did in the ‘60s, which is to target one leader,” said Cliff Albright, co-founder of Black Voters Matter Fund, a voter engagement nonprofit.That doesn’t make them leaderless, activists say. Instead, they call themselves “leaderful.” Even at the beginning of the movement, the power structure was based in collaboration. The Black Lives Matter Global Network was co-founded in 2013 by three female organizers, and the Movement for Black Lives, formed one year later, has no governing board, though it coordinates with more than 150 organizations.\"We don't need someone in the Senate or House to try to build their political career off of this moment,\" said Bryan Mercer, executive director of the Philadelphia-based social justice organization Movement Alliance Project. \"It is a misconception that we need a charismatic leader to carry this work forward.\"Activists in cities all over the country are trading notes through the network as they pressure local officials to explore new public safety options, from doing away with police in schools to slashing budgets or reimagining police departments entirely. The Minneapolis city council’s pledge to break up its police department and start from scratch “doesn't just have implications for Minneapolis,” said Mitchell. “That has national implications.”Angela Lang, executive director of Black Leaders Organizing for Communities in Milwaukee, said she is having more conversations with other Black organizers across the country than ever before. The Milwaukee Fire and Police Commission is in turmoil — with an executive director on the way out and a chairman facing accusations of ethics violations — as protesters demand change. Lang’s organization put together 300 responses for the commission on what residents want to see from the next executive director, and it is pressuring the local police department as its chief wraps his six-month evaluation.Meanwhile, other portions of the movement are organizing bigger national actions. Woodard Henderson, along with the SEIU, the Fight for $15 advocacy group and other unions, orchestrated a strike for Black lives on Monday, with thousands of workers in more than 25 cities walking off the job.Jessica Byrd, a strategist with Three Point Strategies and leader in the Movement for Black Lives, wakes up at 4 a.m. most days to prepare for the online Black National Convention on Aug. 28, which aims to engage 4 million Black people across the country. Ahead of the convention, roughly 1,000 Black activists will meet virtually to craft a 100-day agenda for a potential Joe Biden administration, which will be unveiled at the national gathering. “We have a new election cycle in which we are a central force, whereas in 2016, there were headlines saying that Black movement didn't care about elections,” said Byrd, who oversees the Electoral Justice Project for the Movement for Black Lives, which launched in 2017. Federal lawmakers have already responded to the dramatic shift in public attitudes toward Black Lives Matter, with the Democratic-led House passing a sweeping police reform bill at the end of June. Though multiple senior lawmakers have rejected the \"defund the police\" push, activists see the bill as just a starting point. They countered with their own piece of legislation: the Breathe Act, which seeks to eliminate federal agencies and programs that invest in and expand law enforcement.“We wanted to be clear that we could speak for ourselves,” said Woodard Henderson. “That we could actually write our own federal legislation that is incorporating the policy demands that we've been raising.” The bill has yet to formally be introduced by a lawmaker in Congress, but first-term Reps. Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.) and Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) participated in its rollout with the Movement for Black Lives. Pressley, members of the Congressional Black Caucus and activists with the Movement for Black Lives are in ongoing conversations about the proposal.“I am thankful for M4BL’s leadership and stand ready to work alongside them to fight for structural change, legislate accountability, and move in the direction of justice and healing,” Pressley said in a statement to POLITICO. But other national policy pushes growing out of the movement have inspired dissension within it. One of the most widely known policy plans to come out of the Black Lives Matter movement is the “8 Can’t Wait” proposals from the racial justice group Campaign Zero. The package is composed of “restrictive use of force policies” for local police departments — including banning chokeholds, mandating de-escalation and warning before shooting — which the group argued would decrease killings.Deray Mckesson, co-founder of Campaign Zero, said the platform was meant to “normalize” police reform policies. “If the police are going to exist tomorrow, they should have dramatically less power tomorrow,” he told GQ. But the release of “8 Can’t Wait” in early June was met with swift criticism from a number of activists who felt the proposals did not go far enough in a climate where calls to “defund the police” were gaining wider acceptance. Within a week, Campaign Zero co-founder Brittany Packnett Cunningham announced her departure from the organization in response to the backlash. Campaign Zero issued an apology on its website, saying its campaign “unintentionally detracted from efforts of fellow organizers invested in paradigmatic shifts that are newly possible in this moment.” Jennifer Epps-Addison, co-executive director of the Center for Popular Democracy, said the main contention with the policies is that many of them are already mandated in police departments, demonstrating to her that a more thorough transformation of public safety is needed.\"I was a part of the criminalization apparatus and system myself,\" said Epps-Addison, a former public defender. \"We cannot continue to invest in structures that ultimately need to be dismantled in order for Black people to have freedom.\" As the movement grew after the killings of Trayvon Martin and Michael Brown, federal and philanthropic dollars “poured into reforms, a level of investment we hadn't seen probably since the 1994 crime bill,\" Epps-Addison continued. \"And those reforms don't work.” The “8 Can’t Wait” package has also faced opposition from the other direction, though: In Atlanta, the city council passed the package after the killing of Rayshard Brooks by police in a Wendy’s parking lot. But Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms — a Democratic vice presidential contender — vetoed the package, to the frustration of local activists. “If we can't get that passed in a place like Atlanta, we have a lot of work to get done,” said Nse Ufot, executive director of the New Georgia Project, which mobilizes young voters of color. \"I don't think that [officials] are moving at the pace of change that movement is, and there will be a reckoning.\"",
    "“The legal basis for this use of force has never been explained,” they state.Three House committee chairs are demanding that internal Trump administration watchdogs immediately investigate whether the Justice Department and Department of Homeland Security have \"abused emergency authorities to justify the use of force\" against peaceful protesters — concerns that have gained urgency with footage of unidentifiable security officers confronting protesters in Portland, Ore.\"Reports from Oregon this week make clear that this misuse of resources and personnel remains a growing threat,\" House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, House Homeland Security Chairman Bennie Thompson and House Oversight Chairwoman Carolyn Maloney wrote to DOJ inspector general Michael Horowitz and DHS inspector general Joseph Cuffari.\"Accordingly, we write to request an investigation by your offices into the use of federal law enforcement agencies by the Attorney General and the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security to suppress First Amendment-protected activities in Washington, D.C.; Portland, and other communities across the United States.\"The confrontations in Portland are generating national scrutiny as the state's governor and Portland's mayor have asked the federal agents to leave — and been denied. \"What they are doing is sharply escalating the situation,\" Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler said Sunday on CNN's \"State of the Union. \"Their presence here is actually leading to more violence and more vandalism. And it's not helping the situation at all. They're not wanted here.\"President Donald Trump on Sunday emphasized he had authorized the federal action in Portland and would likely expand it to other cities he has deemed insufficiently responsive to civil unrest aimed at federal monuments and buildings.\"Look at Portland, where the pols are just fine with 50 days of anarchy,\" Trump tweeted. \"We sent in help. Look at New York, Chicago, Philadelphia. NO!\"In their letter, the Democrats trace allegations of an improper federal crackdown to late May, following the death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police officers who now stand charged with his murder. On June 1, federal agents stormed Lafayette Square, where a peaceful protest was being staged for police reform, deploying pepper balls and flash bangs and forcibly pushing protesters away from the park, shortly before Trump strode to the nearby St. John's Church for a photo op holding a bible. The federal response included some security officers who weren't wearing identifiers, raising alarms about a potential lack of accountability.Democrats say Attorney General William Barr orchestrated the crackdown, and they're intent on grilling him about it when he appears before the Judiciary Committee on July 28.The chairs, though, say the news out of Oregon has elevated the urgency to a new level: \"In some cases, citizens could not tell the difference between law enforcement and far-right extremists in the region who wore similar military gear,\" the said, citing news reports of the confrontations in Portland. \"The legal basis for this use of force has never been explained — and, frankly, it is not at all clear that the Attorney General and the Acting Secretary are authorized to deploy federal law enforcement officers in this manner.,\" the lawmakers added.\"The Attorney General of the United States does not have unfettered authority to direct thousands of federal law enforcement personnel to arrest and detain American citizens exercising their First Amendment rights. The Acting Secretary appears to be relying on an ill-conceived executive order meant to protect historic statues and monuments as justification for arresting American citizens in the dead of night.\"",
    "In place of words painted on the street, organizers are calling for immediate policy changes.Since George Floyd was killed by a Minneapolis police officer in late May, Black Lives Matter activists have taken to the streets demanding radical changes to police departments and other parts of government. So far, the political class is offering little more than words painted on streets.That, at least, is the emerging sentiment toward the Black Lives Matters street murals popping up in cities around the country. These efforts, meant to represent a commitment to social justice in local communities, have received praise from community members and some public figures. But they’ve also garnered criticism from activists who are pushing their mayors and governors to move past symbolism and institute immediate policy changes.Rather than ordering the words painted on streets, activists argue, lawmakers should take action to protect Black lives in real time — by enacting the policies that Black organizers have been calling for since before the Floyd protests began. So far, few of those in power are getting the message.“It's not enough. What we're asking for is not, like, a symbolic recognition of how Black lives matter,” said Delilah Pierre, an organizer with the Tallahassee Community Action Committee. The Florida state capital is one of the latest cities to paint the now-familiar yellow-and-black mural across a major intersection. “We're asking for that to be something that's in practice. We're asking for real systemic change to the system that oppresses and marginalizes Black people.”The Black Lives Matter street art, meanwhile, originated more as a way to troll President Donald Trump, who has called Black Lives Matter a “hate group.” Washington, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser commissioned the first BLM mural in early June, in response to Trump’s militarization of the city’s downtown and use of chemicals to clear protesters in front of the White House. She renamed the intersection across from the White House Black Lives Matter plaza and had the words painted across the asphalt in bold yellow lettering.More than a dozen other cities have since adopted the practice. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio was one of the first to follow suit, ordering Black Lives Matter to be painted on Fifth Avenue, directly across from Trump Tower. The Rev. Al Sharpton and members of the Central Park Five participated in its unveiling.Still, activists say that in most places, political leaders have not matched those expressions of support with the kinds of policy changes that would tangibly improve people’s lives. As coronavirus cases continue to spike, Black and Latino patients comprise the majority of cases and deaths. Since Floyd’s killing in late May, more African Americans have been killed by police officers, only further injecting energy into the protest movement against police violence. State and national legislative leaders, meanwhile, have not responded with the kind of urgency the colliding crises demand. Congress has not passed a relief package since May while more than 30 million Americans could be without any income if unemployment relief is not renewed by the end of July. A rent crisis remains on the horizon as more than one-third of Americans missed rent and mortgage payments at the beginning of the month. Black and Latino populations stand to bear the brunt of these calamities, as unemployment remains disproportionately high in both communities. Those realities prompted D.C. activists to immediately paint a counter-message on the street next to Mayor Bowser’s Black Lives Matter mural: “Defund the police.” Black Lives Matter D.C. has also since released a statement condemning the mural and calling it “performative.”“The folks who painted that ... they know very well that that wasn't a genuine thing by Muriel Bowser,” said Sean Blackmon, an organizer with the D.C.-based Stop Police Terror Project, which organizes nationwide against police violence. “And so what that really says is, ‘if you think that Black Lives Matter, Muriel Bowser, then you must defund the police.’”“They paint the letters of your movement on a street and are hailed across the country but they're not willing to look you in the eye and talk about solutions,” said Jessica Byrd, co-founder of Three Point Strategies and an organizer with the Movement for Black Lives. “I mean, it takes an incredible amount of cognitive dissonance to believe that a mural is enough and that it could replace a conversation about structural change in the city.”In some municipalities, leaders have answered the protesters' calls for change. Minneapolis, the catalyst for the wave of anti-racism protests happening around the world, advanced a ballot measure that would disband the city’s police department and establish a new security and violence prevention force. So far, it is the only city to pass legislation disbanding police since Floyd’s death.But with pressure rising from local organizers and the national outcry, a growing number of state and local leaders have announced plans to decrease police budgets for the upcoming fiscal year and redirect the funds to communities of color. Los Angeles’ city council cut $150 million from its police budget. San Francisco has enacted similar measures, pledging to cut from the city’s police budget and reallocate the funds to programs benefiting the local Black community. Defenders of the murals say that art still has a special place in social movements, and the murals are not intended to be a substitute for policy changes. Some protesters have, themselves, erected Black Lives Matter art of their own. It’s a different dynamic, however, Pierre explained, because there is a unique understanding behind the work.“I think when activists go out, and they create those symbols, and they've been doing the work of really trying to uplift Black people in their communities, it's way different. Because they're coming from the perspective of love. And it's kind of a sign of what's to come,” she said. “We can't stop at paintings. We have to really change the system, especially the way that Black people and the police interact.”",
    "POLITICO speaks with the president of Color of Change for an in-depth interview on a new approach he’s spearheading.In the months after the killing of George Floyd at the hands of a police officer, the movement for racial justice in this country has taken up most of the nation’s headspace. But for those that see this movement as a continuation or offshoot of the Civil Rights Movement of the 60s, it can get confusing. The new iteration of that movement for racial justice does not look or feel the same. And that’s by design. There’s no one or two true leaders of the movement, they are less willing to work within the system, they are looking at more than just policy change and they are looking past politicians as they push for change. Organizers see this as fighting against a system that is ingrained in every aspect of this country: it’s past policy changes or meetings with elected officials. “The forces that hold people back are deeply interrelated,” Rashad Robinson, the president of Color of Change said. “That a racist criminal justice system requires a racist media culture to keep it alive. That economic inequality goes hand in hand with political inequality. These things all sort of work together.” In a video interview with POLITICO, Robinson went in-depth on what that meant and a new approach he’s spearheading when it comes to how organizers fix those systems.

    "Democrats and fair housing advocates lambasted the administration when the proposal was released.The Trump administration is resisting calls — even from political allies — to withdraw a proposal to make it more difficult to bring discrimination claims under the Fair Housing Act, even as the nation reckons with racial unrest, according to a letter obtained by POLITICO.Deputy Housing and Urban Development Secretary Brian Montgomery reaffirmed HUD’s plans to issue a final rule later this year in a letter Tuesday to Bank of America Vice Chairman Anne Finucane, who had urged HUD to drop the effort in a letter last month, citing “recent protests and events.”Montgomery responded that HUD has “never ceased working to achieve more equitable results and to correct for past errors, regardless of who is setting policy.”“Contrary to your assertion, the leadership and professional staff at HUD is working on a daily basis to live up to the spirit of the Fair Housing Act,” he added.HUD released a proposal in August to significantly revise a 2013 agency rule by requiring plaintiffs to clear a higher bar to prove unintentional discrimination and giving defendants more leeway to rebut a claim.The proposed revision to the 2013 rule is one of several efforts by the Trump administration to roll back the Obama administration’s use of so-called disparate impact — the legal theory that holds business and governments accountable for practices that disproportionately affect minorities even if no discrimination was intended — to root out discrimination.Democrats and fair housing advocates lambasted the administration when the proposal was released. Now, as companies and organizations across the country rush to publicly show their dedication to racial equality in the aftermath of protests over George Floyd’s death at the hands of police, the calls to withdraw the contentious proposal are coming from closer to home.The powerful National Association of Realtors — second only to the Chamber of Commerce in its lobbying expenditures — urged HUD to retract the proposed rule in a letter Monday, pointing to a “broad consensus across the country that now is not the time to issue a regulation that could hinder further progress on addressing ongoing systemic racism in our country.”HUD has maintained — and reiterated Tuesday — that the proposal merely brings the agency’s interpretation of the disparate impact standard in line with a 2015 Supreme Court ruling.“Although the Supreme Court decision did not address HUD’s rules directly, the Court went out of its way to urge caution in applying disparate impact theory in a manner that might undermine the very mission of both fair housing and helping to develop communities that suffer from lack of investment,” Montgomery wrote Tuesday.The high court held that disparate impact claims can be brought under the Fair Housing Act but said “disparate impact liability must be limited so employers and other regulated entities are able to make the practical business choices and profit-related decisions that sustain a vibrant and dynamic free-enterprise system.”Montgomery also took a shot at Bank of America for withdrawing from the Federal Housing Administration loan program, as many banks have done since the Obama administration aggressively used the False Claims Act to secure hefty penalties from financial institutions after the 2008 financial crisis.Montgomery, who has publicly fretted about banks’ pullback from the FHA channel, said in his letter that HUD and FHA have “had very productive discussions with all of the major banks, with one notable exception: Bank of America.“I applaud Bank of America’s recent $1 billion commitment to aid communities dealing with economic and racial inequities exacerbated by the coronavirus outbreak,” Montgomery wrote. “However, Bank of America’s participation in the FHA program — which reaches double the percentage of minorities compared with the programs offered by your bank — would likely eclipse this amount.”",

But this elevated platform comes with a weighty set of expectations among constituencies with very different views of public safety and has led to rising frustration among members of the Black communities that helped elect them in the first place.“There’s always added pressure on Black mayors dealing with public safety issues,” said Michael Nutter, the former mayor of Philadelphia. “Because you’re caught in the middle — Black communities want to be safe but they don’t want to be abused. As a Black mayor, you have to be able to deliver both of those messages, which at times might be at odds with each other.”While the mayors represent a range of constituencies, they have in common a pro-reform approach to policing that has done little to satiate the demands for change. All have repeatedly expressed support for protesters' efforts, but none have made sweeping changes in their city police departments — even as the calls for them to do so grow louder.“The challenge of being both Black and being a woman ... I think all of that plays into perhaps the cautious nature with which you see these mayors engaging their activist communities,” said Ravi Perry, dean of the political science department at Howard University. “Inherently, these elected officials are ... representing a system that many of the left in the community believe should be dismantled.” That conflict is now playing out under a magnifying glass: Atlanta’s Lance Bottoms, who announced Tuesday that she tested positive for Covid-19, is one of a handful of women atop Joe Biden’s vice presidential shortlist. Washington’s Bowser has feuded with President Donald Trump on Twitter about the protests that took over wide swathes of the nation’s capital last month, after a Black man, George Floyd, was killed by Minneapolis police on Memorial Day. Chicago’s Lightfoot made history last year when she became the city’s first Black female mayor — and signaled police reform would be a priority well before Floyd’s death set off months of nationwide protests. San Francisco’s Breed was also the first Black woman elected to lead her city. All are Democrats.Yet, as the mayors' political profiles have risen, their agendas have also been overtaken by multiple crises. The novel coronavirus, which causes Covid-19, is disproportionately infecting and killing Black Americans in Atlanta, Chicago and D.C. and other cities across the United States (in San Francisco, Black residents are being infected at a roughly proportional rate, but are dying at a higher one). Meanwhile, Demonstrations over police brutality and racism have taken over their streets. And in the wake of an alarmingly bloody Fourth of July weekend in several major cities, including theirs, the debate over public safety has taken on renewed significance.In Atlanta, five people died in 11 gun violence incidents. Chicago saw 15 deaths from 49 incidents, while an 11-year-old was killed in the nation’s capital and a 6-year-old in San Francisco over the July 4 holiday weekend. Atlanta, Chicago and D.C., whose populations are more than 30 percent Black, have also been home to some of the nation’s largest protest demonstrations. It’s an interconnected set of problems that have drawn calls for bold leadership. But activists say the mayors are not living up to that call, despite the hopes that accompanied their barrier-breaking elections. Nine women of color currently serve as mayors in America’s 100 largest cities, according to the Center for Women in American Politics at Rutgers University. In 2010, there was just one — Baltimore’s Stephanie Rawlings-Blake.“We have this boom of Black women mayors and that has really shifted the numbers of Black women who are serving in these executive seats,” said Jessica Byrd, founder of the D.C.-based advocacy firm Three Point Strategies and a leading organizer with the Movement for Black Lives. “But also the movement has grown. It has more specific demands and has more specific examples of the way that governance does not meet the standard that people need in their communities,” Byrd noted.All four mayors' police reform proposals include provisions like increased officer training, diversification of police units and/or higher penalties for excessive use of force. None of the four, however, has passed a defund-divest model in their city budgets, the chief demand from Black Lives Matter activists.In early June, Breed announced plans to redirect funds from the San Francisco police department to the area's Black community. Bottoms, who is up for reelection in 2021, is navigating a police department in flux after the death of Rayshard Brooks, a Black man who was shot and killed by an Atlanta police officer in June, as well as a surge in coronavirus cases in the state. After the shooting death of 8-year-old Secoriea Turner over the weekend, Bottoms took a swipe at those perpetuating the violence, with an allusion to the Black Lives Matter movement, at large.“We have talked about this movement that’s happening across America in this moment in time where we have the ears and interests of people across this country and across this globe,” Lance Bottoms said at a Monday news conference. “But the difference in this moment in time and the civil rights movement, the civil rights movement — it was a defined common enemy. So we’re fighting the enemy within when we are shooting each other up on our streets and the city.” Bottoms’ strong words reveal how the dynamic between mayors and activists extends beyond the common push-and-pull of policymaking to a shared racial identity. Lightfoot has taken a similar approach, both by frequently acknowledging the virus’ disproportionate impact on Black Chicagoans and characterizing herself on Twitter as an omnipresent Auntie to some youth who were reluctant to stay home or social distance. Neither Bottoms nor Lighftoot responded to requests for comment.Still, amid a nationwide reckoning on race and racism, organizers say that the time for talking is over. “For so long in this country, we've tinkered around the edges of structural change,” Byrd said. “And we've said to law enforcement: 'If you could just kill us less, if you could just learn a new trick so that maybe you won't kill us in this specific way, then that'll feel like progress.” Yet, this crisis, Byrd and other organizers argue, requires immediate action from leaders and particularly their Black mayors beyond change within police forces. Many have been asking for this change since long before Floyd’s killing.April Goggans, a lead organizer with Black Lives Matter D.C., described the group’s relationship with Bowser as “contentious.”“She has done everything to discredit, disrespect or ignore us until George Floyd was murdered,” Goggans said. “[She’s] really portraying herself and D.C. as so progressive when it comes to policing and police brutality when she hasn't even said the names of the people who have been killed in D.C. by police.” When Bowser ordered “Black Lives Matter” painted on the street leading to the White House and renamed the area in front of the White House “Black Lives Matter” plaza, the move was seen by national commentators as a powerful affront to President Donald Trump’s law-and-order leadership style and an olive branch to the city’s activist community. Activists, however, saw it as an empty gesture. The same weekend, Black Lives Matter D.C. painted “Defund the Police” in the same large, yellow letters across from the first phrase, a response they said was meant to confront Bowser’s lip service to the issue of police violence and call attention to their demands. Bowser did not respond to requests to comment.Lightfoot and Chicago activists also have conflicting views on police reform. Lightfoot told POLITICO last month that calls to defund the city’s police department make for a “nice hashtag”, but said it would hurt efforts to diversify the force and run counter to what most Chicagoans want. Organizers say her record on police reform is too weak to prove that her current efforts would yield real change.“We're not going to keep saying ‘let’s train the police’ when that hasn't occurred,” said Inez White, an organizer with the Chicago chapter of BYP100, a national organization of young Black activists. “Training police has cost us more money, and has still led to black people being killed.” The pressure on the mayors to deliver policy results has been compounded by partisan gridlock at both the federal and state levels. Congress and many state legislatures have yet to agree on any significant policy changes related to policing, and an overwhelming majority of national legislators are against defunding the police.“What adds to the problem is not having federal or national standards and having each mayor who has to pretty much do his own thing,” said McKinley Price, mayor of Newport News, Va., and president of the African-American Mayors’ Association. “I think it is putting pressure on mayors and pressures on our police chiefs and doggedly for them to try and come up with a plan that's going to be unique and good for them.”Activists say they plan to continue to mobilize against their mayors’ incremental reform models throughout the summer and beyond. They also maintain that leaders still have an opportunity to save face: by increasing transparency in their cities’ budgeting processes, reallocating funds to other municipal services like housing and, perhaps most contentiously, finding alternatives to the police. “In these jobs there’s so many balancing components,” Nutter explained. “You can't have a great city of people who don't feel safe. Those mayors know that.”CORRECTION: This story has been corrected to reflect the fact that Mayor Breed has proposed to redirect funds from the San Francisco Police Department to Black communities and clarifies that Black San Franciscans are being infected at a rate roughly proportional to their population.",
    "Hundreds of companies are boycotting the social media giant. Here’s the backstory of how it happened.The advertising boycott battering Facebook is unlike anything the social-media giant has faced in its 16-year history: Three days in, 800 companies worldwide have pulled millions of dollars in advertising from the social network, with brands from Coca-Cola to Ford to global conglomerate Unilever demanding that Facebook monitor hate speech more aggressively.With pullouts mounting and the company’s name constantly tied to racism and hate in the news coverage, CEO Mark Zuckerberg responded by livestreaming part of an employee meeting — one of the few times he’s done that in the company’s history. Then, on Wednesday, Facebook’s powerhouse policy and communications chief, former British Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, issued an open letter, titled “Facebook does not benefit from hate,” touting its efforts to police its content.The boycott has emerged as a crucial test for a company that has become a key player in American politics simply because of what it hosts and promotes on its site, and which until recently had been vocally doubling down on its commitment to keeping an open platform for users’ speech. It is also a behind-the-scenes triumph for a novel coalition of civil rights groups and other advocacy organizations — the architects of the #StopHateForProfit campaign that many of the boycotting companies have signed on to. Interviews with leaders of the nine coalition partners reveal how the groups spun up a boycott idea in a matter of days, responding to the George Floyd protests late this spring and using public energy to join together several long-simmering, frustrated efforts to hold Facebook to account for its content. They lobbied corporate leaders in private and, in some cases, shamed companies on social media to join the effort.“[Facebook] is a breeding ground for racial hate groups,” says Derrick Johnson, president of the NAACP, one of the groups that made up the coalition. Referring to Zuckerberg, he said, “You can’t reason with the guy.”In short order, the coalition has emerged as perhaps Facebook’s most formidable antagonist, when little else — not Congress, not European regulators, not public declarations by celebrities that they were deleting their Facebook accounts — has had much effect on how the site operates. And their campaign might offer a blueprint for how activist groups can tackle a modern tech giant: fusing novel pressure tactics with the weight of legacy civil rights groups. It remains to be seen whether Facebook will really be dented, either financially or as a brand. The company declined to comment for this article except to point to a statement issued in response to the boycott, saying Facebook “invest[s] billions of dollars each year to keep our community safe and continuously work[s] with outside experts to review and update our policies,” and that it is taking steps to address hate. The statement added, “we know we have more work to do.” So far, the company hasn’t made major concessions, though. And while its stock price has dipped sharply, Zuckerberg — who has long defended the platform as a space for free expression — reportedly has said advertisers would be back “soon enough.” Analysts likewise say Facebook can weather the storm; most of its ads come from small and medium-size buyers, not the large corporations making boycott headlines, and Bloomberg researchers predicted Monday that the boycotts could cost Facebook only $250 million in ad sales — a sliver of the company’s $77 billion in annual revenue.But a look at the origins and dynamics of StopHateForProfit suggests the campaign has at least one insight that people often forget when it comes to a tech behemoth with the Silicon Valley sheen of Facebook: At the end of the day, the social network is just an advertising vehicle, with 98 percent of its revenue coming from ads. And like old-line pressure campaigns against TV networks or newspapers, if you can get to the advertisers, the company has to pay attention.While the boycott came together quickly, its roots trace back to the 2016 election. Amid widespread outrage over the role Facebook had played, one complaint was that Russians were using the site to exploit America’s racial tensions. But the site wasn’t just amplifying them, activists came to believe. It was a petri dish for racism and discrimination; it was growing hate. And, by taking a largely hands-off approach, Facebook wasn’t taking the issue seriously, the activists decided. In the months after Donald Trump was sworn in as president, civil rights groups and other social justice organizations began quietly comparing notes about their interactions with Facebook and Silicon Valley more broadly.“The conversations started really informally, just collecting information. But what we learned was that we were getting played by Facebook and other big tech companies,” says Jessica González, co-CEO of the left-leaning media advocacy organization Free Press. “They had a very strategic appeasement strategy, where they gave us breadcrumbs, but in a way that made it look like they were doing such great work when in fact hate and disinformation were rampant on their site.”The advocates tried to figure out how to get Facebook and other tech companies to take their complaints more seriously. Campaigns to get users to stay away from the platform, or to allow civil rights groups to alert the companies of hateful activities, largely sputtered. In 2018, Facebook announced it would undergo an audit to better understand how it was affecting communities of color and other marginalized groups, led by Laura Murphy, a highly regarded civil rights advocate. But a pivotal five-week stretch this past fall largely erased whatever goodwill was left.On a Tuesday afternoon in late September, Clegg, Facebook’s head of policy and communications, announced the company was exempting politicians’ ads from its fact-checking process, arguing that the public should be able to see, and vet, what political leaders say. Clegg told me in an interview at the time that it was long-standing policy but that, “The purpose of it, I hope, was pretty clear, which was: This is what we’re doing ahead of 2020. These are our plans.”Facebook’s critics took umbrage at both what Clegg said — revealing, they thought, that Facebook failed to grasp the history of American politicians stoking racial divisions — and when he said it. Color of Change, which was founded in the wake of Hurricane Katrina to organize African Americans online, and other groups had been working for months to pull together an event, called “Civil Rights x Tech,” with Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg; it was scheduled for just two days after Clegg’s speech. At the summit, against a backdrop of soaring brick walls and exposed piping in an events space in Atlanta’s West Midtown, Sandberg and Neil Potts, a Facebook public policy director, were pressed on what Clegg had said and reassured the advocates, González told me.Two weeks later, Facebook announced that Zuckerberg would deliver a speech at Georgetown University laying out his thinking on “free expression.” He and Clegg previewed the speech with some of the civil rights leaders. Zuckerberg would be doubling down on the politicians’ exemption, while daring to draw a connection between Facebook and the importance of free speech in U.S. civil rights history, from Frederick Douglass to Martin Luther King Jr.“I warned him of the perils of doing that,” says Vanita Gupta, president and CEO of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights. Zuckerberg did it anyway, in a dramatic 37-minute speech on Oct. 17 from Georgetown’s Gaston Hall. Afterward, the advocates concluded that the CEO believed, deep in his bones, that his commitment to free expression — even if it aligned him with the most virulent strains of American society — was right, regardless of what Sandberg had said in Atlanta. “[Sandberg] seems sincere. She’s certainly good at her job. But the fact of the matter is, at the end of the day, the buck stops with Zuckerberg and the board of directors,” González told me.After the speech sparked a firestorm, Zuckerberg convened a dinner with civil rights leaders at his home in Palo Alto, Calif., in early November. “The last time I was in a room with all of those leaders, the other person at the table was Barack Obama,” Rashad Robinson, executive director of Color of Change, told me last fall. It was a pleasant enough discussion, but he said it solidified for him that civil rights weren’t a priority at Facebook’s highest levels. For Gupta, the fall of 2019 led her to believe Facebook had embraced a moral equivalence between civil rights groups and far-right conservatives, as two constituencies the company simply needed to placate — an approach she says she saw as part of a “structural deficiency” Facebook was unwilling to address.The advocates went into the winter more worried than ever, and trying to figure out what to do next.In late May, after the death of George Floyd at the hands of police in Minneapolis triggered a revival in the Black Lives Matter movement, then protests, then widespread public outrage, civil rights advocates found themselves on a conference call with Zuckerberg that would turn out to be a key moment in developing the boycott plan. It started on May 29, when Trump posted — on Twitter and Facebook — a note about a possible federal response to protests in Minnesota: “Any difficulty and we will assume control, but when the looting starts, the shooting starts.” Trump would later say he was simply warning that looting can lead to violence, though many saw the tweet as a dog whistle.Twitter, which already had begun taking a harder line on Trump’s tweets, attached a warning label to the post stating it violated the site’s rules against “glorifying violence,” but that “Twitter has determined that it may be in the public’s interest for the Tweet to remain accessible.” Zuckerberg, meanwhile, ruled that Trump’s post hadn’t violated his site’s policies on violence speech, and said that if it had, Facebook would have taken it down. “Unlike Twitter, we do not have a policy of putting a warning in front of posts that may incite violence because we believe that if a post incites violence, it should be removed regardless of whether it is newsworthy, even if it comes from a politician,” Zuckerberg wrote on Facebook.The swipe at Twitter, which, in the eyes of advocates, had taken the post more seriously, irked them. “When Mark Zuckerberg criticized Jack Dorsey for that, we realized we had even more of a serious problem than we thought,” Johnson, the NAACP president, told me. Reports that Zuckerberg had talked over his decision with Trump himself didn’t help. On Monday, June 1, came the conference call. It was a prescheduled conversation, in which Zuckerberg planned to talk with civil rights leaders about Facebook’s preparation for the 2020 election, but the topic of Trump’s posts came up too. Trump also had floated theories about how Democrats were trying to “rig” the 2020 election by promoting the use of mail-in ballots during the coronavirus pandemic. Facebook had said in a statement that it didn’t touch Trump’s post because, when it came in elections, it believed in “robust debate.” “I’m seeing Mark’s face as he’s trying to explain to Sherrilyn Ifill” — president of the NAACP’s Legal Defense and Educational Fund — “why something isn’t voter suppression. He’s trying to talk down one of the most important voting rights litigators in the country,” Robinson told me. Gupta says she went into the call eager to hear Zuckerberg’s rationale for dealing with the posts. But she told me, “I was completely dissatisfied with it. It was completely confounding and did not make sense.”For Robinson, it was a turning point. “What are we doing here? I don’t understand why I keep coming to these meetings with you all,” he remembers saying on the call. “I said to [Zuckerberg], and Sheryl, and Nick Clegg, and [global policy director] Joel Kaplan, ‘I feel like we have to do some other pivot.’ I’m saying to them that I’m going to have to go another route.” Gupta was similarly frustrated, yet she determined that the advocates couldn’t just “throw up our hands and walk away and just say, ‘Screw it.’”At those same moments, another set of advocacy groups was beginning to have conversations about where to go next. Among them was Sleeping Giants, a loose, semi-anonymous online collective that calls itself “a campaign to make bigotry and sexism less profitable.” The group had developed a reputation for taking down powerful targets with a fairly simple tactic: show their advertisers exactly what their ad dollars are supporting and quickly gin up, using social media, public pressure to get them to stop. Starting in 2016, the group had waged successful campaigns against Breitbart News and Bill O’Reilly.Now, as company after company put out its own statement supporting Black Lives Matter amid protests across the country, an opening for a similar strategy emerged with Facebook. If corporations were really serious about fighting racism, then why not back away from advertising on Facebook for hosting racist speech?Jim Steyer, who heads Common Sense Media, a group focused on improving the media landscape for families and children, knew Matt Rivitz, one of the two leaders of Sleeping Giants, and they had a conversation with Jonathan Greenblatt, CEO of the Anti-Defamation League. Along with Common Sense, the ADL began spreading word through progressive political circles that their small coalition was thinking of pushing for a one-month ad boycott of Facebook. At the same time, Robinson and Color of Change were contemplating something similar and, after hearing about the ADL-tied effort, decided to join forces. Mozilla — the somewhat strange hybrid of tech company and online advocacy organization, which had long criticized Facebook’s handling of its users’ data and privacy — had worked with Common Sense in the past, and got pulled in. Others did too: the NAACP, the media advocacy group Free Press and, later, the League of United Latin American Citizens and the National Hispanic Media Coalition. Brenda Victoria Castillo, president of the NHMC, told me her group joined the coalition to make sure Latinx voices were represented — to leverage their strength: “We have $1.7 trillion buying power, and advertisers listen to those statistics.” (The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, led by Gupta, has not joined the boycott call. A spokesperson for the group said no one was available to discuss why.)“We felt like, ‘What else do we have to lose here?’” the NAACP’s Johnson says. “We’ve been speaking out and meeting with the company to no avail. We thought, ‘We need to do something.’”Not long after Zuckerberg’s conference call, the campaign had a name: #StopHateForProfit. “It was so quick, it was crazy,” Rivitz says. “It was an idea and then it was, ‘Hold on, we’ve got to talk to other people.’ And then it was, ‘Let’s go.’” They settled on a one-month boycott, a limit they hoped would force corporations to act fast. Plus, even if ad budgets were expected to be down in July anyway, with the country still suffering through the coronavirus and its economic fallout, the tight timeline meant companies could handle whatever lost revenue might come from ditching what is a widely popular means of digital marketing for them.Just before it launched, the campaign got a prominent boost. At an online event on June 16, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a strong Facebook critic, said, “Advertisers have tremendous leverage” over the company, and “I would say to them, know your power.” The next day, StopHateForProfit trumpeted the same message in an ad in the Los Angeles Times. (While he wouldn’t tell me if it was a coincidence, Jim Steyer pointed out that he and his brother — billionaire and former presidential candidate Tom Steyer — are close with Pelosi and her staff, and called the speaker’s message “very timely.”)The campaign officially began on June 17, with Sleeping Giants tweeting out the #StopHateForProfit hashtag to its more than 300,000 followers, calling on companies to join. Two days later, North Face was the first to sign up, saying it would stay off Facebook “until stricter policies are put in place to stop racist, violent or hateful content and misinformation from circulating on the platform.” REI and Patagonia quickly followed. The other coalition partners worked their networks, too, both privately and publicly. The ADL, a Jewish organization founded in 1913, began circulating images showing advertisers Facebook posts alongside their ads. One Geico ad, for example, sat next to a post calling financier and philanthropist George Soros, a frequent target of anti-Semitism, “the face of evil.”Robinson told me he and Johnson did a video call with the CEO of Ben & Jerry’s and discussed the ice cream maker not just joining the boycott, but also calling on Unilever, the multinational conglomerate that owns Ben & Jerry’s, to join. On June 23, Ben & Jerry’s put out a powerful statement. Three days later, Unilever announced it would stop advertising on not just Facebook and Instagram, but Twitter, too, at least through the end of the year, citing corporate responsibility pledges and “the polarized atmosphere in the U.S.”Meanwhile, representatives from Mozilla reached out to the tech world, to explain how the company had stopped advertising on Facebook in 2018 and “how we’ve reinvested our own marketing dollars,” Mary Ellen Muckerman, the company’s interim chief marketing officer, told me. “You know, it’s always, like, ‘fly by the seat of your pants and see what works,’” Rivitz of the launch. But this was a pretty good start.So far, the advertiser pull-outs represent only a fraction of Facebook’s revenue — analysts said at the start of this week that they still expect the company to have a strong quarter, with some $17 billion in sales — but the PR blitz and creeping sense that the site was becoming toxic to ad buyers got the site’s attention.The boycott organizers had hoped that keeping the push limited to a month would act as a forming mechanism, pushing Facebook to make quick changes. The coalition came up with 10 specific demands, among them installing a high-level executive with civil rights expertise, doing away with the fact-checking exemption for politicians’ speech and creating human points of contact for Facebook users experiencing identity-based harassment. On the same day the campaign for the boycott launched, someone close to the situation tells me, Facebook called a rush meeting that pulled in officials from across teams — including its marketing, policy and legal operations — to discuss what to do.Then, on June 24, Sandberg emailed Johnson, Greenblatt and Robinson, according to a copy of the email seen by POLITICO. “At Facebook, we stand against racism and discrimination of any kind,” she wrote. “We are working to understand and address the concerns you outlined in your #StopHateforProfit campaign.” She mentioned the civil rights audit, “which has been in progress for two years,” and asked to continue the discussion in a meeting with her and Chris Cox, a Facebook veteran close to Zuckerberg who recently returned to the company to serve as chief product officer. Two days later, in a rare move, Zuckerberg opened up the first few minutes of an employee meeting to announce some fairly minor changes to the company’s handling of elections and political content, such as banning posts that falsely claim that immigration officials will be visiting polling places and labeling some politicians’ posts that violate the site’s rules. The company also announced it would undergo a marketing audit that would examine, among other things, how safe its platform is for advertisers. And it removed hundreds of accounts associated with the so-called Boogaloo Boys, a far-right movement that sprung up around the George Floyd protests. The company published a list detailing how it is addressing or otherwise thinking about some of what boycott organizers had asked for. Clegg also issued his open letter, saying both that “Facebook does not profit from hate” and “We may never be able to prevent hate from appearing on Facebook entirely, but we are getting better at stopping it all the time.” The boycott organizers say it’s not enough — that the changes are too small and Facebook’s explanations too vague to satisfy them yet.In response to Sandberg’s email, the advocates pressed to meet with Zuckerberg himself, not just Sandberg. On July 1, Facebook said it agreed. The conversation is being scheduled, both sides say, for after the Independence Day holiday.When I asked Robinson what he plans to say, he told me that’s the wrong way to think about it. Facebook requested the meeting, he points out, putting the onus on them: “They have our demands.”",
    "State legislators have introduced scores of police reform proposals, but few have become law as legislatures adjourn for the year.Just a little over two weeks after George Floyd was killed by a white Minneapolis police officer who pinned Floyd down with a knee on his neck, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz promised that the state “will change the way we do policing.” It hasn’t.Neither have the vast majority of other states across the country. Legislators in two dozen states have introduced scores of police reform bills since Floyd’s death on May 25, but just five governors have signed any of those measures into law.With federal legislation on policing stalled on Capitol Hill, the onus is on states and cities to pass laws to reform policing. But, like Congress, itself, most states have so far been unable to meet the moment. And even those that have taken action — New York, Utah, Colorado, Iowa and Oregon — have not gone nearly far enough, activists say. It’s yet another reminder that, despite the deluge of protests against police brutality and racism across the country and rising public support for police reform, the status quo still has the upper hand.In Minnesota, legislators introduced dozens of police-related bills last month, but thanks to partisan bickering, not one passed before lawmakers adjourned their legislative session. All told, 30 state legislatures have already adjourned until 2021 — freezing reform efforts for at least six months. Eighteen of the states whose legislatures are still in session are considering dozens of bills, according to a National Conference of State Legislatures database, but all but a handful are stuck in committee. New York was one of the first states to act, when Gov. Andrew Cuomo signed laws on June 15 and 16 instituting a series of reforms requiring state police officers to wear body cameras, creating a Law Enforcement Misconduct Investigative Office and mandating that courts compile and publish racial and other demographic data of low-level offenses. New laws also require officers to verbally report instances in which they discharge their weapon in a situation where someone could be hit by a stray bullet and for police and peace officers and other law enforcement representatives to provide medical and mental health attention to anyone in custody.In Utah, Gov. Gary Herbert signed legislation barring peace officers’ use of chokeholds or restraints that could cause unconsciousness and prohibiting those officers from being trained in use of that technique. Colorado and Iowa also both enacted new laws before their legislatures adjourned in June. Colorado Gov. Jared Polis signed a comprehensive bill that requires body cameras by 2023 and public release of footage after receipt of a misconduct complaint. The new law also prohibits chokeholds, ends qualified immunity and requires peace officers to intervene when another officer is using unlawful force and an annual report on data involving use of force, contacts by peace officers, unannounced entries by peace officers and resignations from peace officers while under investigation for violating department policy. Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds signed a bill that strengthens restrictions on law enforcement officers’ use of chokeholds and allows the state attorney general to prosecute officers whose actions result in someone’s death, among other things. And on Tuesday, Gov. Kate Brown of Oregon signed five police-reform bills, including measures barring chokeholds, prohibiting use of tear gas and sound cannons and establishing a statewide database of police officer discipline records. The remaining bills awaiting signature in other states include a ban on law enforcement’s use of chokeholds in Delaware unless “the person reasonably believes that the use of deadly force is necessary to protect the life of a civilian or a law enforcement officer” and another that would create a referendum for voters to determine whether to abolish the Glynn County Police Department in Georgia and transfer its responsibilities to the county sheriff. The county police department handled the investigation into the death of Ahmaud Arbery, a Black man who was chased down by white men and killed while jogging through a neighborhood.New Mexico lawmakers passed a bill last month requiring peace officers “who routinely interact with the public to wear a body-worn camera while on duty,” but Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham hasn’t signed it yet.Several governors have also taken executive action in recent weeks, almost all in states that haven’t succeeded in passing reforms through legislation. Cuomo is the lone exception: He issued an order that tasks cities to develop new policies alongside police chiefs and stakeholders or risk losing state and federal funding. Gov. Ned Lamont of Connecticut’s order bars state police from using chokeholds and other restraints that restrict oxygen or blood flow to the head or neck, requires marked cars to have a dashboard camera and uniformed officers to wear a body camera and demilitarizes the police force by preventing purchase or acquisition of military and military-style equipment from the federal government.Other governors have used executive authority to create or expand task forces and commissions, including Arkansas' Asa Hutchinson, Michigan's Gretchen Whitmer and New Hampshire's Chris Sununu.While the new state-level policing rules “are critical for accountability, transparency and harm reduction,” American Civil Liberties Union’s policing policy adviser Paige Fernandez said, they “quite simply aren’t enough.\"Such “procedural justice reforms,” Fernandez said, “attempt to mitigate harm after the fact,” such as abolishing qualified immunity, which shields officers from liability for constitutional violations that don’t break “clearly established” law. “We really need to focus on the front end of things, not the back end. This moment is an opportunity to implement transformational changes across the country.”Federal lawmakers, who will return to their districts this week for a two-week Fourth of July recess, have the power to make those kind of significant changes nationally. But with Democrats in control of the House and Republicans in power in the Senate, both sides would have to compromise on a bill President Donald Trump would support and sign into law — a seemingly quixotic endeavor as the 2020 election heats up and Trump tweets, “LAW AND ORDER,” from the White House.Senate Democrats last week blocked a Republican-led bill they said didn’t go far enough, and House Democrats passed a bill — with the support of just three Republicans — that won’t see the light of day in the Senate.The House bill would crack down on excessive police force, ban chokeholds, enforce national transparency standards and create accountability for officer misconduct with a national database to track offenses. But some activists believe even that’s not enough.“If Congress really wanted to meet this moment, it should’ve moved to invest billions and billions of dollars in community-led alternatives to policing and in health care and housing and substance-abuse programs, not tinkering around the edges and giving more money to training police,\" said Kumar Rao, director of justice transformation at the Center for Popular Democracy, a liberal Brooklyn-based advocacy group.That’s left activists to turn their focus to city officials, with local residents flooding city council meetings and protesters calling for defunding city police departments. For example, while Minnesota’s state government has failed to act, the Minneapolis City Council has advanced a proposed ballot measure that would abolish the Minneapolis Police Department and create a Department of Community Safety and Violence Prevention.Voters of all ideologies support reforming police departments across the country in some form. More than 60 percent of registered voters told Morning Consult that police departments need minor or major reforms. Forty-eight percent of liberals said police departments need major reforms, as did 45 percent of moderates and even 26 percent of conservatives, nearly half of whom said police departments need only minor reforms. Across the political spectrum, only a small percentage of voters said police departments need no reforms at all.Color of Change Executive Director Rashad Robinson cautioned, however, that policies alone won’t solve Black Americans’ problems with policing. Speaking at a virtual POLITICO town hall on policing and racial justice Tuesday, he argued that power must also play a role.At the same forum, Lisa Cylar Barrett, policy director at the NAACP Legal Defense & Educational Fund Inc., agreed that power makes a difference.“But I also believe that policy has to change,” she said. “The laws have to change, and that does make a difference.”",
    "As coronavirus deaths mount and Donald Trump strikes a law-and-order pose, some of Sanders’ die-hard college supporters are begrudgingly coming around to the former veep.As the Democratic primary drew to its conclusion, a flurry of Students for Bernie college organizations made clear where they stood: There was no way they could vote for Joe Biden. If Sanders wasn’t the nominee, they planned to either sit out the fall election or vote third party.But as coronavirus deaths mount and Donald Trump strikes a law-and-order pose against the protests sweeping the nation, many of the leaders of those groups are rethinking their hard-line position. And faced with a choice between a candidate they distrust due to his lack of progressive bona fides, or ushering in the second term of an incumbent they loathe, more than a few leftist college student leaders are learning to live with Biden.“In recent weeks, it's become pretty clear that Trump is willing to crack down on free speech, and so it's definitely making me lean more toward Biden now,” said Harry Feldman, a Georgia Tech senior and co-chair of the school’s Young Democratic Socialists of America chapter, who was considering voting third party in Georgia. The last straws, Feldman said, were Trump’s threats to put down unrest with military force and his “when the looting starts, the shooting starts” tweet. Amira Chowdhury, co-director of a left-wing University of Pennsylvania group that vowed in late March it “will never endorse, nor support Joe Biden,” has also come around on the former vice president. She attributed it to what she called Trump’s failure of leadership, bigotry and racism in recent weeks and her role as a voter in a swing state that Trump captured by just over 44,000 votes in 2016.“With a heavy heart, and with great anger and frustration, and with great rage towards the Democratic establishment, I will vote for Biden,” said Chowdhury, whose Penn for Bernie group is now known as Penn Justice Democrats.The 77-year-old Biden still has a ways to go with all younger voters, a demographic cohort he struggled to gain traction with during the primary season. Chowdhury’s organization, for example, has declined to formally support the presumptive Democratic nominee.But recent polling suggests that Trump’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic and his response to the George Floyd killing and subsequent protests have softened the resistance to Biden among younger voters.In early April, according to POLITICO/Morning Consult polling, Biden had the support of 48.5 percent of voters between the ages of 18 to 29. By early June, that percentage had jumped to 53 percent.A Global Strategy Group/NextGen America poll of young voters also saw support for Biden spike after the first wave of protests. Biden’s advantage over Trump among 18-to-34-year-olds increased from 18-points between May 20 and May 23, to 27 points between May 29 to June 3.Andrew Baumann, senior vice president of Global Strategy Group, a Democratic polling firm, said Trump’s polarizing rhetoric on racial justice pushed an important issue for young voters to the forefront of their voting calculus.“It is the issue where they already saw the biggest distinction between the candidates, because they understand that Trump is a racist who has no interest in changing and tackling systemic racism in this country,” Baumann, who oversaw the report's youth voter research, said. “But it’s also put a rocket booster on that. Trump’s response has made it even more clear how dangerous he is to them.”Baumann said he’s seen qualitative and quantitative evidence that young voters are shifting toward Biden due to Trump’s handling of the protests — even in cases where their opinion of Biden hasn’t drastically changed.Hayley Mon Goy, a Florida State University junior who supported Sanders in the Democratic primary, agreed that Trump’s response to the anti-racism and police brutality protests solidified her decision to vote for Biden, even though he was far from her first choice.“Looking at Trump now, he’s really shown his true colors in how he’s handling the situation in the country, not only with coronavirus, but with all the protests,” Mon Goy said. “As a progressive, even though people may not love Biden, it’s pushing them towards voting for him.”Other college activists say they are looking harder at Biden because they are confident he could handle the Covid-19 crisis better than Trump.“The coronavirus pandemic has definitely made me feel that Biden would be a more responsible leader in office,” said Bhargav Tata, founder of Georgia State for Bernie. “But with regards to the massive protests, one thing that does give me pause is Joe Biden's history with racism.”Tata, who is transferring to New York University this fall but will cast his ballot in Georgia, said he is “60 percent” sure he will vote for Biden. Pointing to Biden’s adoption of parts of Sanders’ free college plan, as well as Biden’s gun safety efforts and clean energy pledges, Students for Biden coordinator Lubna Sebastian said leftist college students can find a home in the Biden camp.“It's really important to realize that a lot of the policies that Joe is talking about, and his vision for America, is very progressive,” Sebastian said.There are still quite a few college Sanders supporters who remain unconvinced.“Right at the time [Sanders dropped out], I was very up in the air of whether or not I would vote for Joe Biden,” said Creighton University sophomore Joey Rougas. “But seeing Joe Biden's response to first the coronavirus pandemic, and then his response to the recent protests around police brutality, I don't think that I'm going to vote for him because I think his response has been very lackluster.”Esau Delgado, a University of Michigan junior who was a leader of his school’s Students for Bernie chapter, is another student who says he recently shifted away from voting for Biden. He pointed to the Tara Reade sexual assault allegation as cause for his suspicion of Biden.“But on the other hand, I know that I need to do my part and obviously, Joe Biden for me is better than Donald Trump,” Delgado said, noting he would likely make up his mind on Election Day.",
    "Activists want to defund the police. Biden won’t even legalize pot.At a megachurch in Phoenix this week, Donald Trump regaled a crowd of mostly maskless students with a story about the moment he said he knew he would win a second term.The president explained that he was in the White House recently and passed by a TV screen and saw the words “defund and abolish.”“What are they going to defund and abolish?” Trump said he asked. “The police,” he was told.“Oh, great, I just won the election!”The data suggest otherwise. In fact, since the killing of George Floyd at the hands of a white police officer on May 25 and the rise of protests against police brutality and systemic racism, including activist calls to defund the police, Joe Biden’s average polling lead over Trump has doubled from 5 to 10 points. The day after Trump's Arizona event, The New York Times published a poll showing Trump down by a staggering 14 points.Trump might be forgiven for his misreading of the political situation. Some of Biden’s advisers had the same initial view of the politics of the protests. Biden’s campaign is led by an older and whiter group of operatives who came of age during a political era when many Democrats saw large-scale protests for racial equality as inherently alienating to many white voters. In some quarters of the party, street protest brought back the traumas of 1968 and Nixon’s 32-state landslide.“The first thought of someone my age is Nixon and law and order,” said an adviser to Biden, who is white and in his late 60s and admitted concern early on that the protests could benefit Trump. The person was granted anonymity in order to speak candidly. “But as long as we don’t have a reversion to looting and lawlessness, as long as it’s peaceful and about the inequality of society and the treatment of African Americans, this has seen a shift in Biden’s direction—and more than we thought it would be.”Biden did not endorse the controversial activist slogan, steering clear of Trump’s attacks. On June 10, he wrote an op-ed for USA Today laying out his views on police reform and stated unequivocally, “I do not support defunding police.”The spasms of vandalism and theft that marked some of the early protests have diminished, replaced by the targeted toppling of statues memorializing the Confederacy. Mitt Romney marched in Washington and said, “Black Lives Matter.” Polls reflected a seismic shift in the electorate’s attitudes: 76 percent of the public say racism and discrimination is a major problem, up from 68 percent in 2016. Seventy-one percent of white people agree. The Black Lives Matter movement now has majority support. The expected revolt of white suburbanites against the protests hasn’t materialized. Instead, they’ve joined them.“This is no longer a traditional wedge issue because all of a sudden white Americans, particularly college educated whites, understand that racism is real,” said Cornell Belcher, a veteran Democratic pollster who worked for Barack Obama. “Those white suburban women now understand that they have skin in the racism game as well. And that changes everything.”But the question remains: What is Biden’s role as the Democratic nominee, as America reckons with racism? Despite his consistent edge in polls, there are risks for Biden. Though he has endorsed banning chokeholds and reforming qualified immunity, his promotion of community policing has left activists and organizers in key states angry and concerned that he’s missing a moment to be bolder. Internally, Biden’s campaign is balancing how to best respond to the transformational demands of protesters while maintaining his commanding lead over Trump. Biden gained the lead by staying largely out of the spotlight as Trump has praised the “beautiful heritage” of the Confederacy and called protesters “thugs.”If elected president, Biden must force a “frank, truthful, painstaking conversation” about America’s racism, said Rep. Bobby Rush (D-Ill.).“I'm not sure if he has the understanding, but he has to become a transcendental president,” Rush said. The opportunity is here; the question is, can he rise up to it?”Biden’s advisers point out that racial justice is at the heart of why he’s running for president. He has often said that Trump’s 2017 comment praising “very fine people” at a pro-Nazi rally in Charlottesville is what pushed him into the 2020 race. “He’s been very clear he wouldn’t be running unless Donald Trump were president,” said Symone Sanders, a senior adviser to Biden.During the primaries, Biden bet everything on winning overwhelming support from African American voters, who eventually reversed the near collapse of his campaign in the first three states. Biden’s advisers were often less attentive—and sometimes downright dismissive—of certain obsessions of the social media left. Biden did not discuss white privilege the way Kirsten Gillibrand did. He didn’t endorse reparations or the legalization of marijuana when some of his chief rivals did. He stubbornly insisted that the two most important primary constituencies were political moderates and older working-class African Americans, two groups without much influence online. The Biden campaign’s unspoken primary slogan could have been, “Twitter isn’t real life.” This cautiousness and skepticism has spilled into the general election. One way to think of the Biden campaign’s navigation of racial issues is that he and his advisers care a lot more about addressing policy demands than they do about addressing cultural issues. “There is a conversation that’s going on on Twitter that they don’t care about,” one Democratic strategist observed. “They won the primary by ignoring all of that. The Biden campaign does not care about the critical race theory-intersectional left that has taken over places like The New York Times. You can be against chokeholds and not believe in white fragility. You can be for reforming police departments and don’t necessarily have to believe that the United States is irredeemably racist.”Sanders offered a slightly more nuanced view. “It’s not that we’re dismissing anyone’s voice, because we hear the voices, we hear the feedback,” she said. “We are, though, laser-focused on making sure that we’re not running a campaign that only caters to the internet.” Twitter is one thing. But what happens when the largest racial movement in 50 years—in response to the killings of Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor—collides with the campaign of a politician best known for hammering out cloakroom deals in the Senate?One view of how Biden sees his role is that he is self-aware enough to understand what an unlikely leader he is of a Democatic Party that has been characterized in the Trump era by the women’s movement that greeted his inauguration, the antiracism movement that is defining the final year of his term, and the millennial left that has risen in the years in between.“It’s important to remember what Vice President Biden said in the last couple of months that he intended to be a transition figure for the Democratic Party,” said Sen. Brian Schatz, the 47-year-old Democrat from Hawaii who is a favorite of progressives. Schatz argued that unlike Obama, who was a singular personality who “blocked out the sun” when it came to other Democratic leaders, Biden’s goal—as contradictory as it may seem—is to help raise up the new generation of Democrats, many of whom are to his left. “He’s certainly at the helm as our nominee and as our party leader,” Schatz said. “But I think he understands that there is a movement that undergirds the left right now which is deeper and wider and more likely to last into the future regardless of who’s the titular head of the party.”A similar view comes from some activists who often have the most clear-eyed view of politicians, seeing them not as heroic shapers of history but merely as instruments who respond to pressure. “I think Democrats didn’t know what to do at this moment and that’s typical,” said Maurice Mitchell, national director of the Working Families Party and a social movement strategist. “Movements operate with different prerogatives than traditional electoral politics. Mass movements always lead—they come up with new ideas and surface problems that aren’t new but the surfacing of the problem makes visible something that had been invisible because we’ve tolerated it for so long and the problem has become woven into the fabric of the country.”From this perspective, the fact that Biden is a relatively nonideological politician who has continuously shifted with the political tides to remain close to the consensus view of his party might be a feature, not a bug. “Nobody expects Vice President Biden to organize a direct action,” Mitchell said. “That’s not his job.”Just as Mitchell would expect, Democratic candidates across the country are recalibrating their positions on police reform and racial justice to catch up with the public. One Democratic campaign operative working on a Senate race said he was blown away by a recent poll his candidate commissioned. “Racial issues were one of the top three concerns of the Democrats we polled,” he said. “It was right there with health care.” Biden was quick to embrace two previously controversial positions: banning chokeholds and reforming qualified immunity for law enforcement officers, a change that Obama opposed as president. “Symone was like you gotta do this and he did it,” said a prominent Democrat who advises the campaign. “And he did it pretty quickly. The police hate it.”But other issues highlighted by the Black Lives Matter movement and its allies have not been embraced by the Biden campaign. And some Democrats worry the presumptive nominee’s reluctance could dampen enthusiasm for him among African American voters who have suffered disproportionately through the trio of 2020 crises: the coronavirus pandemic, the subsequent economic collapse and the epidemic of anti-Black policing.Activists have pointed out that over the past month, as thousands took to the streets in hundreds of cities, Biden’s policy platforms on criminal justice and policing have not changed on his website. In a letter to Biden’s campaign last week, more than 50 progressive groups criticized his response to the mass protests, calling on him to incorporate policies crafted by the Movement for Black Lives. “Joe Biden doesn’t have to be a revolutionary,” said Jennifer Epps-Addison, president of the Center for Popular Democracy. “But he has to agree to actually bring folks who have been marginalized both by the Democratic and Republican Party to the table, and have a conversation about how we are going to ensure that we break down these systems of racial- and economic- and gender-based inequity in our country.” Last July, as part of his criminal justice platform, Biden proposed injecting $300 million into the Community Oriented Policing Services program, which was created by the now-controversial 1994 crime bill and has had questionable success. To the dismay of many activists, Biden has stood by his COPS funding plan.“Folks that are not regular voters are looking for more than that,” said Cliff Albright, co-founder of Black Voters Matter. “Not all black voters equal the black electorate in the primaries; if he does not understand that, or doesn’t care to understand that, he runs the risk of losing.”For activists who’ve long led the Black Lives Matter movement, Biden’s unyielding defense of the COPS program is a disappointment and more important than getting Biden to say “defund the police.”“I don’t care if he never utters those three words,” Albright said. A “unity” task force, created by Biden and Bernie Sanders, recently waded into the fraught debate over defunding the police, and efforts by Sanders’ appointees to push some version of a defund policy were dead on arrival, according to several people with direct knowledge of the matter.A senior adviser to the Biden campaign said there was almost no chance that Biden would nix his COPS proposal, arguing that those federal dollars allow Washington to shape police reform at the local level.Another flashpoint inside the campaign pits progressives against Biden stalwarts over the issue of legalizing marijuana, which has been hotly debated among members of the task force.Multiple people said marijuana policy has been discussed on the criminal justice panel, one of the policy groups of the unity task force. Sanders appointees have advocated for legalization. Some Biden appointees personally support legalizing pot and have debated putting the policy in the panel’s recommendations to the former vice president, according to two people familiar with its deliberations.Biden supports decriminalization, but has resisted calls to make cannabis legal—a reform endorsed by the majority of his primary opponents, including vice presidential contenders Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren. The criminalization of marijuana has contributed to the country’s mass incarceration problem, disproportionately affecting black men. Chiraag Bains, a co-chair of the criminal justice task force tapped by Sanders, said Biden should “end the War on Drugs, including by legalizing marijuana.” He said those are his personal views, however, and he was not speaking as a leader of the task force.“There’s an opportunity to advance a really bold agenda on criminal justice,” he said. “This is part of envisioning a completely different future, not returning to a pre-Trump era. I say that as someone who served proudly in the Obama administration. We just have to be much more aggressive about rooting out systemic racism and injustice in the legal system.”Faiz Shakir, Sanders’ 2020 campaign manager who oversees the Sanders wing of the unity task force, confirmed that members have talked about issues such as marijuana, qualified immunity and defunding the police. Shakir, who declined to discuss details, said the fact that Biden announced support for reforming qualified immunity is a victory for progressives.There has been a sense in the wake of Floyd’s killing that Biden’s team has been more amenable to other reforms.Though activists and the young voters they represent want more, Democratic strategists say Biden’s evolution on policing may be enough for voters as long as they’re aware of his actual policies. “Police reform [and] racial profiling are not a secondary issue consideration for these younger voters. They are in fact, a front-and-center primary issue consideration for these younger voters,” Belcher, the Democratic pollster, said. He added, “If we go into August or after this convention and I’m in focus groups with millennials and they don’t understand where Joe Biden is on criminal justice reform, it is a failure on Democrats’ part.”",
    "A historic moment for the country has devolved into an ugly, partisan blame game on Capitol Hill.As the United States faces its biggest crisis over civil rights in decades, Congress is poised to do nothing. Again.What could have been a searing, soul-searching moment where America’s political leaders helped establish a new national accord on race and the role of police in society has instead devolved into a frenzy of political posturing, campaign sloganeering and ugly partisan fights.The House on Thursday passed a sweeping police reform bill that would ban chokeholds, end the use of “no-knock” warrants, create a national registry for officers accused of misconduct, and make it easier to prosecute officers. Yet Democrats picked up only a few GOP votes, guaranteeing the proposal has no chance of moving in the Senate.And the Senate can’t even agree to begin debate on a police reform bill, with Democrats blocking efforts to take up a proposal drafted by Sen. Tim Scott (S.C.), one of two Black Republicans on Capitol Hill. “It’s really unfortunate,” Scott said. “You’d like to think that we’re all willing to get together on something as consequential as police reform in a moment like this.” Rather than restart their efforts to find a solution, party leaders are pointing fingers at the other, suggesting Washington's latest attempt at reform is all but finished. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and other GOP senators were infuriated when Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Republicans are “trying to get away with murder, actually. The murder of George Floyd.” They demanded she apologize. Pelosi refused. Then Sen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.) angered Democrats when he suggested Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) had “a chokehold” on the Republicans’ version of police reform. Democrats said that comment showed GOP leaders weren’t serious about addressing the issue of police brutality.Things aren’t much better down Pennsylvania Avenue. The White House didn’t make any effort to broker a compromise; instead, senior aides whipped House Republicans against the Democratic bill, according to GOP sources.President Donald Trump, trailing badly in the polls, has turned to repeatedly tweeting out “Law and Order!,” a clear sign that he isn’t interested in anything Democrats were proposing. The president instead has threatened to use “overwhelming force” to end protests, urged “long-term prison sentences” for anyone caught tearing down statues, and accused the country’s first Black president of “treason.” Eric Trump, the president’s son, called Black Lives Matter protesters “animals” at a rally last week, to cheers from the crowd.It’s a level of nastiness between the two sides that’s become common in the Trump era, grinding non-essential legislative work to a halt and sapping any energy to move big bills, be it on immigration and infrastructure, or gun control and policing.The exception, of course, was the trillions of dollars that Congress approved this spring to respond to the coronavirus pandemic and stave off an economic meltdown — dual crises that forced both sides into rare bipartisan action. Although that, too, only came after weeks of theatrics from both parties. And with the explosive issue of police brutality and racism, what little opportunity there was for compromise quickly faded.“It’s bad,” said Sen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.). “The last three and a half years, the president’s tried to divide this country and he’s done a pretty effective job of it, and he’s divided the Democrats and Republicans to almost a toxic environment.”“There’s not one single conversation between a Democratic member and a Republican member in order to achieve a bipartisan bill in the House,” complained Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.). “At this moment of a presidential election year, a divided America, an economy in chaos, the health crisis, and layer on top of that we can’t physically be with one another to work things out, it makes the outcome this screwed up and awful.”In the days after Floyd’s murder in Minneapolis, there seemed to be an opening for real action — a groundswell moment that would force Democrats and Republicans to set aside their differences and deliver something to a restive and angry American public. But in recent weeks, the prospect of a bipartisan compromise has dissipated. Each party has refused to amend their version of the bill, even as they deliver soaring speeches from the House and Senate floor about the need for action and show up to demonstrations talking about getting something done.“We’re just going to sit here and take shots across the building with a Senate bill and a House bill and no resolution. And then we’re going to fly home tomorrow,” said Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas). “In what universe is that the right thing to do?”For many senior lawmakers — particularly Black members who led this fight for decades — it’s exactly what they were afraid would happen from the beginning. “My fear was that we might end up in a stalemate over significant legislation, maybe some of the most important legislation to come to the floor in my 15 years,” said Rep. Emanuel Cleaver (D-Mo.), a former chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus. “What I hope the American public will understand is that follow-through matters as it relates to credibility,” Cleaver added.Rep. Brenda Lawrence (D-Mich.), another member of the CBC whose district has erupted in protests in recent weeks added: “It doesn't matter if you have the best bill in the world if it never gets passed.” Frustrated rank-and-file members say they cast blame in both parties, with senior Republicans and Democrats working on their own separate tracks from the start. And it has infuriated many of the freshmen who rode a wave in 2018 vowing to end the Washington gridlock.Many lawmakers left town after the House vote on Thursday disappointed in the failure to act and worried about how the country will react to the breakdown.“It’s just too important to simply pass and move on to the next item. This is what we’re here for,” Rep. Dean Phillips (D-Minn.), who has frequently lamented that leaders of both parties don’t work toward consensus. “It’s always been my expectation, and frankly, dream, that [bipartisanship] starts in the very beginning But I think we do it in reverse here, too often.”“It’s kind of symptomatic of what’s wrong with this place in general, and that’s kind of evolved over a long period of time,” added Sen. Mike Braun (R-Ind.).Yet Rep. Karen Bass (D-Calif.), the CBC chairwoman who led the effort on the House Democratic bill, still believes that some kind of deal can be reached.“We’ll be talking, I spoke to Sen. Scott last weekend. I plan to call him today. I don’t see this situation as over at all,” Bass insisted. “I have a long list of my Republican colleagues from Judiciary who expressed opposition to all sorts of things in the hearing. I think that leaves a basis from which to talk.”Also optimistic was Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the high-profile freshman Democrat who has urged her own party to embrace more ambitious policy solutions to endemic problems of poverty and inequality.“I think the amount of people in the street and the pressure has created a unique circumstance where I do believe both parties are feeling the heat to pass something,” Ocasio-Cortez said. “I think that people are working with the failures of institutions,” she added. “They’re working around it in order to push through the changes they’re looking for.”",
    "The vote on Democrats' bill comes one day after the Senate failed to advance a narrower GOP proposal.The House passed a sweeping police overhaul bill Thursday, one month after the killing of a Black man by a Minneapolis police officer sparked a nationwide movement for systemic reforms of the criminal justice system.Every Democrat voted for the package, which was drafted by the Congressional Black Caucus in a matter of days amid multiracial demonstrations in dozens of cities seeking justice for George Floyd’s death. Ultimately just three Republicans — moderate Reps. Will Hurd (R-Texas), Fred Upton (R-Mich.) and Brian Fitzpatrick (R-Pa.) — backed the measure.Speaker Nancy Pelosi took the rare step of casting her vote and announcing the 236-181 tally. The bill would crack down on excessive police force and ban chokeholds, enforce national transparency standards and push accountability for officer misconduct with a national database to track offenses.“To the protesters: we hear you, we see you, we are you,” House Democratic Caucus Chairman Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) said in an impassioned speech on the floor just before the vote.Jeffries, one of the most senior Black members in Congress, said he first learned of Floyd’s death from his young son, who told him, “‘Dad, it’s happened again. What are you going to do about it?’”“I say to him, and I say to all those other Black children throughout America: We are here today as House Democrats to do something about it,” Jeffries said.The three Republicans who ultimately supported the bill defied direct instructions from the White House to oppose it, handing a minor victory to Democrats, who can now say they passed a bipartisan police reform bill. Still, Democrats’ success likely ends there as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has signaled he will not take up the package, leaving virtually no hope it will become law.“Exactly one month ago George Floyd spoke his final words, 'I can’t breathe,' and changed the course of history,” Pelosi said on the steps of the Capitol before the vote. “When we pass this bill, the Senate will have a choice: to honor George Floyd’s life or to do nothing.”Thursday’s vote comes one day after the Senate failed to advance a narrower policing bill — leaving the two chambers at a stalemate even as the nation faces a reckoning on race and police brutality.Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, the Senate’s only Black Republican, was the lead author of the Senate’s police reform bill. But many Democrats dismissed the legislation, calling it a “sham” that only paid lip service to the systematic changes they say need to take place.“The Senate bill is [a] sham, fake reform,” said House Judiciary Chair Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) alongside Pelosi. “It gestures, using some of the same words, but it does nothing real.”Other Democrats, like Rep. Emanuel Cleaver of Missouri, a former CBC chairman, were slightly gentler in their criticism.“I have a lot of respect and admiration for Tim Scott … and so I believe that he tried to get as good a bill as he thought he could get with the Republican-led Senate,” Cleaver said in an interview.“I think he did the best that he could with the Republican legislature,” he added. “I just don’t think many people in the Senate quite understand the magnitude of this time.”But Democrats, particularly senior members of the CBC, say the passage of their bill is a monumental step forward for a Congress that has allowed legislation to ban chokeholds or demilitarize the police to languish for years. In one sign of the enormity of the moment, Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) — who represents Minneapolis, including the block where Floyd died after a police officer put his knee on Floyd's neck for nearly nine minutes — presided over the House floor earlier in the day.“Thank God for the activists. Thank God for the screaming from the streets that has awoken a lot of people to how the severe disregard for life and racism has been playing out every day in America,” Rep. Brenda Lawrence (D-Mich.) said in an interview. “We need transformational change.”The House bill has won endorsements from a slew of prominent advocacy groups, from the NAACP to the AFL-CIO to the American College of Physicians. A long list of entertainment industry celebrities have signaled support as well, from Lizzo to Justin Bieber to Ariana Grande. On Thursday, the measure also earned backing from another set of powerful voices: the parents of African Americans killed by police.“The unjust killing of a loved one, especially at the hands of law enforcement, is a pain too many families have been forced to endure,\" said Gwen Carr, John Crawford Jr. and Samaria Rice — the parents of Eric Garner, John Crawford III and Tamir Rice, respectively. Backers of the bill noted that Rice would have turned 18 on Thursday. \"We are proud to support this effort because it’s the right thing to do.\"Some Democrats and Republicans had initially hoped to send legislation to President Donald Trump’s desk before the July Fourth holiday — a scenario that is now unlikely.Democrats have refused to scale back the central components of their bill, such as banning chokeholds or abolishing the “qualified immunity” doctrine that protects police officers from lawsuits. Republicans, meanwhile, have said they will simply move on to the rest of their summer agenda until Democrats signal a willingness to back down on some of those elements.Several Democrats had been quietly working with moderate Republicans like Hurd, Upton and Fitzpatrick in the last few weeks in a behind-the-scenes effort to garner their support for the bill. Still, most Republicans voted against the policing bill with several citing one major issue as the primary reason for the stalemate: whether police should be held personally liable for misconduct on the job. Trump also publicly urged GOP lawmakers to oppose the bill, and few in the party are eager to cross him.Within the Democratic Caucus, the package ran into remarkably little resistance, which has historically faced some internal divisions between its moderate and progressive factions. Democrats in swing districts had initially been hesitant to support the bill for fear of blowback from powerful police unions, but all supported the bill in the end.“The people in the streets are saying, ‘We are not going to go away, this issue is not going to fade,’” Rep. Greg Meeks (D-N.Y.) said in an interview.“I think our moment is going to continue, like I said,” he added. “If the Senate refuses to negotiate, that will reverberate against them, I believe, in the November elections.”Kyle Cheney contributed to this report.",
    "The CBC is in the spotlight as Washington faces a reckoning on police brutality.This may be the most pivotal moment for the Congressional Black Caucus in its nearly 50 years of existence. The group has never been more influential in Washington, now playing an outsize role among House Democrats and the broader party. Several CBC members are being vetted as possible vice presidential picks, and others are being talked about as future speakers. CBC members now chair four major House committees, with even more possible next year. And no major bill goes through the House without Democrats asking, “What does the CBC say?” Yet it’s also a tumultuous time to be Black in America, including for the CBC and the veteran lawmakers who make up its ranks. Black and minority communities have suffered inordinately from the coronavirus pandemic. The deaths of African Americans while in police custody continue to roil the nation and have turned Black Lives Matter into a global movement. And Congress — once again — appears to be paralyzed over how to confront police brutality and systemic racism. “It’s true,” House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn (D-S.C.) said of the CBC’s mounting influence in the current political landscape. “But only because — for the first time — people are able to visualize what the CBC has been trying to talk about for a long time.” “All of a sudden, these [videos] are out there. And people are beginning to see what we’ve been seeing for a long, long time,” Clyburn added.Clyburn, the highest ranking African American in Congress, was pivotal in helping secure the Democratic presidential nomination for Joe Biden with a decisive victory in the South Carolina primary. Black voters remain the bedrock of Biden’s base heading into the November election.  The videotaped killing of George Floyd and the huge outpouring of support for BLM has also brought to the forefront a much more aggressive group of progressive activists who are not satisfied with incrementalism. These activists are willing to tear down political shibboleths as much as they’re willing to tear down statues of once-venerated Americans. And that puts the CBC, not to mention the broader Democratic Party, in a political bind: They need to deliver results now. Rep. Karen Bass, who is in her second year as chair of the CBC, spent years as a civil rights activist in Los Angeles — where she was sometimes harassed by the city’s police officers — before launching her political career in California. The five-term Democrat said she understands the pressure from protesters in the streets calling for more drastic action than what’s in the policing bill being considered on the House floor Thursday. “It is the role of an activist to push us as far as they can push us. It is our role to legislate, and that is a different role,” Bass said in an interview. “It takes an outside and an inside strategy to bring about change. We work on the inside, we know what is realistic. We are very committed to making a difference, and that is different than making a point. You can either make a point, or you can make a difference.” Bass — who saw her home city torn apart by riots after the Rodney King beating nearly 30 years ago — said she and her colleagues in the CBC must craft a response that can actually pass, or risk squandering the chance entirely.“Personally, I always want to do more. But again, I want to be successful with the legislation,” Bass said. Bass and other members of the CBC said they recognize the immensity of this moment and the spotlight their caucus has after years of feeling like leaders in both parties didn’t prioritize issues facing Black Americans. That includes some of the same policing measures that the House is preparing to pass, including a ban on chokeholds and language to make it easier to sue police officers for misconduct. “We have had, for years, individual members of the Black Caucus who have submitted legislation, and it was kind of just, ‘Yeah, yeah, we hear you.’ People sign on, but it doesn't go anywhere,” said Rep. Brenda Lawrence (D-Mich.). “Now, to actually see members of Congress look to us for leadership, look to us for direction, for advice, and counting on us to help get this right — there’s a tremendous amount of, I would say, pressure, I say that personally, that we make a difference and we get this right,” Lawrence said.For some, the challenge is bigger than any in the CBC’s history. “Make no mistake, this is a CBC moment. This is what those founders wanted to have in place at a time of crisis,” said Rep. Emanuel Cleaver (D-Mo.), a former chair of the group.  “We have been placed on center stage of this American racial and justice moment. … Things are in place and we cannot flunk this moment,” he added, noting the scores of young activists who continue to demonstrate across the country as they look to the CBC for guidance and change. The CBC had already been “all hands on deck” this spring, as members described it, as the coronavirus pandemic disproportionately hit Black communities. Its members were deeply involved in the House’s multitrillion dollar pandemic relief bills, pushing hard to ensure money went to the neediest families and to minority-owned businesses that already struggled with access to capital.Floyd’s death in late May — and the national reckoning on race that has followed — put the CBC even more squarely in focus. Clyburn, Bass and other senior Black Democrats immediately took the lead on the legislative response, with white lawmakers, including Speaker Nancy Pelosi, intentionally staying on the sidelines. “In this moment, the CBC is known not only as the ‘conscience of the Congress,’ but really, the place where action is happening. It’s not just a moral compass question. It is, ‘How do we act? How do we respond?’” Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester (D-Del.) said in an interview. Still, the House bill faces slim odds of being passed in the Senate, which deadlocked over a narrower GOP proposal Wednesday. Real policing reform, Democrats say, may not come until after November if they can take back the White House and Senate — a reality that may further frustrate activists.Meanwhile, the CBC has been undergoing its own changes, as its members and those of the House Democratic Caucus at large skew younger and more progressive. Some of the most prominent members of the organization — John Conyers, Elijah Cummings and Charles Rangel — have retired or died. The 80-year-old Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.), a hero of the civil rights movement, has been battling pancreatic cancer. Yet after the 2018 elections, the CBC’s ranks grew by nine, including trailblazing members from suburban Connecticut and upstate New York representing majority-white districts. The CBC’s ranks are poised to grow even further in 2020, particularly as the scourge of anger over systemic racism begins to seep into this year’s elections. Several Black candidates saw an unexpected surge in Tuesday’s primaries with several winning in landslides. Two candidates in New York are likely to become the first openly gay Black members of Congress. Among the successful Black candidates on Tuesday was Jamaal Bowman, a liberal challenger who appears to have knocked down 31-year incumbent Rep. Eliot Engel (D-N.Y.). This came despite Engel’s backing from the CBC. It wasn’t unusual for the CBC to back Engel, a longtime white ally, over a Black candidate in his primary. Commitment to seniority has long been a bedrock CBC principle — a necessary system, they argued, to ensure that Black lawmakers are able to assume their rightful leadership roles within the caucus, instead of being passed over for less senior white members, as in decades past. But that seniority system has been repeatedly questioned in recent years, with members no longer content to wait decades to become committee chairs or party leaders. And those younger members have questioned the value of a system that has kept some older Democrats in leadership positions long after they stop being effective just to maintain seniority. Most recently the issue has popped up on the campaign trail, with the CBC facing criticism for endorsing white incumbents over Black primary challengers. The CBC took heat for backing white Rep. Mike Capuano over Black challenger Ayanna Pressley in 2018, and once again in this cycle for supporting Engel over Bowman. Rep. Gregory Meeks (D-N.Y.), chairman of the CBC’s campaign arm, staunchly defended the decision to support Engel and other white incumbents over Black challengers. Engel, Meeks said, has fought for years against police brutality in his Bronx district. And just because it is now a majority-minority district, that shouldn’t automatically disqualify a white candidate, Meeks added. “He went to jail, he fought … he was out there supporting those issues in those times. So that means something, you don’t throw that away,” Meeks said. “You judge a person based upon the merit of their service. So if you earn it, that’s who we support.”  Other CBC members now say its endorsement policy should be reevaluated, even as they acknowledge the internal struggle over shunning a long-time Democrat — who may have been a strong advocate for the Black community — in support of a Black challenger. “We’re hard-pressed to say that we don’t want someone because of the color of their skin to continue to serve. Having gone through so many times we’ve been excluded. It is hard,” Lawrence added. But Lawrence said she would encourage the CBC to withhold endorsements in certain races in the future, for instance, if there is a “qualified African American challenger” running against an incumbent. “Black candidates are running and fighting and qualified to run for office,” said Lawrence, who fought in a tough primary herself before coming to Congress. “We are going to have to look at that.”",
    "The troops will not be armed, and will “serve as a uniformed deterrence and crowd management capacity to maintain closures and restricted areas.\"About 400 unarmed D.C. National Guardsmen are on standby at the D.C. Armory to provide backup to National Park Police to help prevent damage at “key monuments” in the city, a Defense Department spokesperson said Wednesday.Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy activated the troops to support the police in “a civil disturbance and security role around the District,” at the request of Interior Secretary David Bernhardt Tuesday. The move was approved by Defense Secretary Mark Esper, said DoD spokesperson Chris Mitchell in a statement. None of the troops has since been dispatched to any monuments, according to the statement, but they will remain on standby. The troops will not be armed, and will “serve as a uniformed deterrence and crowd management capacity to maintain closures and restricted areas,” the spokesperson said. The news comes after demonstrators on Monday defaced a statue of Andrew Jackson in Lafayette Square outside the White House and tried to pull it down. Local media reports said protesters will again try to tear down a statue of Abraham Lincoln this week after they were unsuccessful Tuesday. The D.C. mayor's office, which has been at odds with the administration over the deployment of troops, said it learned of the move from media reports. \"The monuments are within the jurisdiction of the federal government — specifically the National Park Service and the United States Park Police — and therefore those agencies need to determine adequate and reasonable protection,\" said Kevin Donahue, deputy mayor for public safety and justice, said in a statement. Tensions between Mayor Muriel Bowser and President Donald Trump flared this month when the president raised the possibility of deploying military forces to the city. Early this month, thousands of National Guardsmen left Washington after assisting the 1,200 D.C. National Guardsmen to help deal with protests that broke out after George Floyd’s death in police custody in Minneapolis. ",
    "The House is expected to pass sweeping Democratic legislation on Thursday.Senate Democrats sank Republicans' police reform plan Wednesday, blocking a key procedural vote amid a fierce partisan clash. The 55-45 vote came a week after Republicans unveiled the measure, led by Sen Tim Scott (R-S.C.), the only African American GOP senator. Senate Democrats, who have their own proposal to curb police misconduct, argued the bill didn't go nearly far enough. Sens. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), Doug Jones (D-Ala.) and Angus King (I-Maine) voted with all Republicans to proceed — short of the 60 votes needed to advance. The outcome is a deadlocked Senate once again, with both parties accusing the other of failing to negotiate in good faith, even as the country engages in a reckoning over police brutality in the aftermath of George Floyd’s killing by Minneapolis police. Still, senior lawmakers were reluctant to admit the debate was completely finished.\"Mitch McConnell has a way of trying to bully us around and he thinks he can get his way, and if past is prologue... our caucus held together and each time he came back,\" said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) after the vote. \"The Republican Party sees the handwriting on the wall, they see what the American people feel.\"Prior to the vote, McConnell defended Scott's proposal and accused Democrats of giving a \"last-minute ultimatum\" by turning \"this routine step into a partisan impasse.\" McConnell also demurred when asked when he would bring the bill back up after Democrats filibustered it. “Well, we will let you know. It can be done under a motion to reconsider at any point,” he told reporters. McConnell took procedural steps to bring the bill up quickly on the floor anytime this year if he wants.  Senate Republicans argued that Wednesday’s vote was a way to begin the police reform debate and that the process would allow for consideration of amendments. Democrats said there’s no point in voting to advance a bill they see as fatally flawed and that won’t have the 60 votes needed to pass the Senate. Instead, Democrats called on Republicans to come back to the negotiating table to come up with a bipartisan solution that the Senate could then vote on. The Senate minority is particularly frustrated that GOP leaders put the bill on the floor before holding any talks to craft the plan or consider it in committee.Democrats say Scott's bill is a non-starter, and highlighted opposition from key civil rights groups, including the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund and the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights. President Donald Trump blamed Democrats for the bill's failure Wednesday, saying they \"don't want to do it because they want to weaken our police.\" Following the vote, Sens. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) thanked the Democratic caucus for mostly staying united.  \"It's of note that there's a great diversity within our caucus... but there was an incredible consensus around this issue,\" Harris said. \"Let the beginning be today of a real conversation where the United States Congress will do its job in meeting the moment, in responding to the demands of the people and doing what is well within our grasp, take us at least one step closer to that ideal of equal justice under the law.\" Manchin was one of the few Democrats to buck his party. “I know there’s a lot of skepticism whether McConnell could actually have amendments,\" Manchin said. \"And we can vote however on proceeding from there, cloture and all that. If he doesn’t, we’ll [stop it], I've talked to Tim Scott, Booker and everybody. And I just said guys there are some things we agree on, we’re not that far apart.”The GOP bill requires additional disclosures about the use of force, codifies reporting requirements on the use of “no knock warrants,” provides incentives for chokehold bans and makes lynching a federal crime.The Democratic proposal, led in the Senate by Booker and Harris, would ban chokeholds and no knock warrants in federal drug cases. It would also limit qualified immunity for police officers to make it easier to sue police — something Democrats argue is key to holding police officers accountable for misconduct, but which most Republicans won’t consider. The House is set to pass a sweeping Democratic police reform proposal Thursday.Senate Republicans are accusing Democrats of wanting to campaign on the issue and say that if they want to improve the bill, they can do so through the amendment process. In his floor remarks following the vote, which McConnell and other Senate colleagues stayed to watch, Scott chastised Democrats for being unwilling to compromise and emphasized that he told his Democratic colleagues the bill could be amended. \"We're failing at politics,\" Scott said. \"The actual problem is not what is being offered. It is who is offering it. Took me a long time to figure out the most obvious thing in the room. It's not the what. \"Burgess Everett contributed to this report.",
    "The mayor says the status quo for law enforcement has failed but argues defunding the police would hurt diversity on the force.CHICAGO — Lori Lightfoot was a federal prosecutor handling a big drug conspiracy case in the late 1990s when she asked to go on a ride-along with Chicago police officers on the city’s South Side. It was a chance to get a first-hand look at how deals went down on the street.As they cruised from block to block, the officers made a surprise stop. They got out and grabbed a Black kid they saw at a corner. “Scared the bejesus out of everybody, me included,” Lightfoot said in an interview this week.When Lightfoot asked why they made the stop, the answer was stunning in how routine it turned out to be, she recalled: “We thought the kid had a gun.” Did he? “No, we were wrong,” they said. And they went on about their day after Lightfoot scolded them.“That had a really, lasting impression on me,” said Lightfoot, who is now Chicago’s mayor — the first African American woman to hold the office. “Those are the kind of things where you … don’t feel like you have claim to the geography under your feet, where people can just be stopped for any or no reason. How do you build on that? How do you have trust?”Lightfoot, a Democrat, swept last year's run-off election as a reform candidate willing to challenge the power structure of city government. Law enforcement in Chicago already had a troubling track record of civil rights violations that led to a consent decree with the Justice Department under the Obama administration, a process the department still operates under. She was also tapped to be president of the city's Police Board, a civilian oversight panel, by her predecessor, Rahm Emanuel.Once an outside agitator, Lightfoot is now on the inside battling on multiple fronts. She's caught between a defensive police department and warring with its union while staring down activists in the streets who don't believe her ideas match the scale of the problem. What's layered on top are many of the same struggles other liberal mayors across the country are confronted with while trying to keep a deadly pandemic at bay: eroding relationships between the police and communities of color, a whopping $700 million budget hole, streets filled with protests over the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, and bursts of everyday violence.The police confrontation that disturbed Lightfoot more than 20 years ago still plays all over America today. But she's not prepared to align herself with efforts to “defund the police,” a movement energized by Floyd's death, nor does she believe it conflicts with her own work to overhaul local law enforcement.“Defund the police” is a “nice hashtag,” Lightfoot said, but it ignores how reform works, will hurt efforts to diversify the force, and goes against what Chicago residents are telling her they want. That resistance has been echoed by Democratic mayors in New York, Los Angeles, Atlanta, and Washington, D.C., where Mayor Muriel Bowser recently said “We fund the police at the level that we need it funded.\"Lightfoot, who sat down for a wide-ranging interview about police reform in the aftermath of Floyd's death, said the debate about overhauling law enforcement is more nuanced than protesters will admit.“Not a single person” Lightfoot has spoken to from Chicago’s neighborhoods has said they want fewer police officers on hand, she said a day after one of the city’s most violent weekends of the year where 106 people were shot and 14 killed, including a 3-year-old. Literally “defund” the police, Lightfoot said, puts newer recruits the city needs at risk because they lack seniority. “We'd have to get rid of the youngest, most diverse, most well-trained officers.\"While Lightfoot may butt heads with the demands of “defund” protesters, she seems to align with the principles in spirit. “The status quo has failed,” she said. And she agrees with redirecting officers so they’re not answering social-service-related calls that they’re not always equipped to handle. The first responder has been police, and “that doesn't make sense. And we know that,” she said. The city is looking at models used in other cities where dispatchers are trained to know who to send to an emergency call — maybe it’s a police officer, maybe a social worker, or both.In her view, there’s a middle ground that includes more transparency, and officers who are licensed — an idea supported by Illinois’ Attorney General Kwame Raoul and Secretary of State Jesse White, two statewide Black elected officials.Lightfoot says licensing would set standards and “hold people accountable” for their actions.“You go and get your nails done, you get your hair cut, you get your oil change. All those people are licensed and certified by the state,” Lightfoot said. “We talk about policing being a noble profession, but there is no uniform standard across the country.”A lack of transparency, means bad cops today can leave one town and go to another, with no one being the wiser.Lightfoot also said reform must include resolving a contract with the Fraternal Order of Police that lapsed three years ago. “No police union is going to give up hard-fought rights easily, and I expect a fight. But I’m optimistic,” she said, referring to a police contract with Chicago Police. Lightfoot hopes to hear word from an arbitrator this week on where that stands.Lightfoot’s biggest move toward reform started long before Floyd’s killing seized the nation's attention. She initiated INVEST South/West, a program that’s funneling hundreds of millions of dollars into the city’s South and West sides, areas hardest hit by violence and long ignored by previous administrations focused more on building Chicago’s downtown.The goal of INVEST South/West is to improve public safety and attract businesses to invest in the neighborhoods, an effort that takes time, Lightfoot acknowledged.All her ideas — on transparency and licensing, a union contract and business investment — aren’t “something you can snap your fingers” and make happen.“You’re talking about building authentic, lasting relationships. And in some instances, you're starting with some partnership. In some other instances you're starting with nothing,” Lightfoot says. “That’s hard work. But it's necessary work. And we've got to take the time that is necessary to build those trusting relationships.”",
    "Senate Democrats are poised to filibuster the Republican plan — and Harris' efforts could help position her to join Biden's ticket.Senate Democrats are preparing to torpedo Republicans’ police reform proposal. And vice-presidential frontrunner Kamala Harris is leading the way. It’s a critical moment for Harris, who has faced scrutiny over her record as a former state attorney general. But as she finds herself in the middle of a messy congressional debate over how to stop police killings of Black people, she has a national platform that others in contention for vice president simply can't match.After largely hunkering down since leaving the presidential race, the California Democrat was front-and-center in the Senate on Tuesday, which will go down as a pivotal day in the movement to tackle police misconduct and also, potentially, in the maneuvering to be Joe Biden’s running mate.The California Democrat tore into a GOP proposal from Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.) as inadequate before he even finished writing it. She coordinated with former 2020 rival Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) on a letter rejecting the GOP’s approach on the floor. And she tangled with a senior Republican on the Senate floor over Democrats’ opposition to even debating the GOP bill, producing a moment that went viral on the left.  Harris also conceded it may take until after November with a new Congress and White House to pass the kind of reform that she thinks the nation needs.“We cannot proceed with what they’re offering. It’s empty. It’s empty,” she told a pair of reporters on Tuesday. “There’s no question that if we are in the majority in the Senate and that if Joe Biden were president there would be a lot more movement.” Harris added that she’s “not at all” thinking about her prospects to join Biden’s ticket after spending an hour on the floor trashing the GOP’s approach as “not meeting the moment” and debating Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas). She called working on law enforcement issues “part of my life’s work.” And she declined to address her private talks on police reform with the presumptive Democratic nominee. Harris said if Republicans started work on the legislation in the Senate Judiciary Committee rather than bringing it directly to the floor, Democrats might find themselves in a far different place. Instead, they are preparing on Wednesday to filibuster a GOP bill because it doesn’t establish strong new federal policing standards, which could stop the police reform effort in Congress until next year. “She could show some leadership by helping us get started so then we can work toward a consensus,” Cornyn said after their confrontation. “It’s not rational. So it’s hard to understand. It’s almost like these folks haven’t been in the Senate very long and they don’t know how to legislate.”Harris’ combative appearance Tuesday recalled the most memorable moments of her relatively brief tenure as a senator, including staring down Trump appointees Bill Barr, Jeff Sessions, and John Kelly — and tearing into Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh during his confirmation hearings. Again, it was the unscripted rejoinders that garnered her the most attention. Before Harris could finish her speech, Cornyn, a fellow Judiciary Committee member, interrupted to remind her that her anti-lynching legislation was part of the Republican reform effort. She quickly rejected the idea of using it as a bargaining chip and said “It’s like saying to a mother, ‘Save one of your children and leave the others.’” The standoff ended with a quintessential Harris moment — a curt reply that stops an opponent in their tracks — which her Senate aides quickly shared on Twitter. “Don’t you think that sort of interaction and debate and negotiation out in front of all 330 million Americans would be beneficial to healing our country and coming to some consensus about what the appropriate reforms should be?” Cornyn asked. “Indeed,” Harris shot back, referencing her earlier critique of the GOP’s process. “That is the beauty of the Judiciary Committee. Our meetings are public meetings.” While Harris and her party were pummeled by the right after they went public with their opposition to even beginning floor debate on the GOP’s bill, their position is backed in the civil rights community. “The black community is tired of the lip service,” said Ben Crump, the prominent civil rights attorney who is representing George Floyd’s family. “Kamala has achieved changes in California from working within the system and coordinating with us who are not inside. Now she’s doing that nationally.” Harris has not exactly emerged as a bipartisan deal-cutter in her short Senate career. She was one of just three Democrats to oppose a centrist immigration compromise in 2018. But she did back the bipartisan criminal justice reform bill, and Booker defended her willingness to get a deal with the Trump administration — even as the president has bragged about it regularly.\"How many things does she have to do demonstrably to show she’s beyond politics when it comes to issues of racial justice?” Booker said.  Scott said that while he’s been talking frequently to Booker, he didn’t connect with Harris until a bipartisan meeting on Tuesday, about 24 hours before the upcoming vote. Scott said it yielded no “discernible” progress. “I’ve tried to touch base with her on several occasions. We’ve been playing phone tag and text tag and we had four different meetings set up that keep getting canceled,” Scott said. “She has not been a part of the conversations I’ve had.” A Harris aide acknowledged they had difficulty connecting but disputed that four meetings were set up and canceled. Aside from brisk Senate votes, Harris has largely stayed with her husband in their Washington apartment since the coronavirus quarantines. A leading contender to join Biden on the ticket — and the only black woman in the Senate — she spent weeks focused on bills to help small businesses and address health disparities of people of color amid the pandemic. But since the killing of Floyd by police in Minneapolis galvanized the movement around police accountability and racial justice, Harris has worked to become a key voice on the issues, appearing at protests and taking the lead on the reforms. Crump said he wants to see a black woman picked as Biden’s No. 2, and Harris’ resolve in the Senate on police reform has only solidified his opinion of her.  “Kamala would be an outstanding vice president,” he said. “She has the right temperament. She has the sensitivity to listen when necessary, but to lead when it is required on issues that matter.” Her push has also won over some skeptics who viewed her as too accommodating to law enforcement over her career as a prosecutor and state attorney general and believe she squandered several chances to advocate for ambitious changes in those roles.Negotiations over the fate of the Democrats’ police reform bill, which calls for banning chokeholds and no-knock warrants and would make it easier to sue police officers accused of wrongdoing, again tested her taste for concession. This time, Harris’ advocacy among congressional Democrats was “central” to Democrats' approach, said Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.). Harris, Booker and Schumer were coordinating for weeks, since the Democratic bill was introduced and throughout the GOP’s rollout of its own legislation. Harris even panned Scott’s legislation before it was introduced, showing she decided early on his approach fell short of what was needed. Had Harris chosen to weaken the Democratic bill, and then brought her caucus along, she would have faced considerable backlash from activists wary of accepting what they view as political window dressing. At the same time, some Democrats said they worried about acquiescing to something that would allow Trump to claim progress on the issue — however modest — at a crucial time in his re-election bid. “This is the floor. This is the minimum that can be done right now,” said Lynda Garcia, policing campaign director at the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights.  Garcia, a veteran of the Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division, said in order for the outlined reforms to work, they have to be enacted together. Still, she and others conceded that they still worry about not passing any legislation at a time when people are hungry for reform. “There are folks out there who think making these sorts of changes still falls short of the changes that need to happen, such [as] shrinking the role of law enforcement and pulling them away from public health issues,” Garcia said. “But I do think there will be a lot of disappointment and a lot of discord if they don’t pass something.”",
    "Police dispersed the demonstrators.WASHINGTON — Protesters tried to pull down a statue of President Andrew Jackson near the White House on Monday night before being dispersed by police.WUSA-TV in Washington reported that police used pepper spray to move protesters out of Lafayette Square, where the Jackson statue is located. Videos posted on social media showed that the protesters had climbed on the statue and tied ropes around it, then tried to pull it off its pedestal.The statue shows Jackson in a military uniform, riding a horse that is rearing on its hind legs. The 19th century president’s ruthless treatment of Native Americans has made his statue a target of demonstrators protesting the United States’ legacy of racial injustice.The Jackson statue remained on its pedestal Monday night.President Donald Trump tweeted late Monday that “Numerous people” had been arrested for “the disgraceful vandalism.” He added: “10 years in prison under the Veteran’s Memorial Preservation Act. Beware!”Interior Secretary David Bernhardt was at the scene Monday night, and issued a statement saying: “Let me be clear: we will not bow to anarchists. Law and order will prevail, and justice will be served.”On June 1, law enforcement officers forcefully cleared peaceful protesters from Lafayette Square so Trump could stage a photo op at a nearby church.",
    "The mayor did not give an immediate timeline for clearing out the occupation.SEATTLE — Faced with growing pressure to crack down on an “occupied” protest zone following two weekend shootings, Seattle’s mayor said Monday that officials will move to wind down the blocks-long span of city streets taken over two weeks ago that President Donald Trump asserted is run by “anarchists.”Mayor Jenny Durkan said the violence was distracting from changes sought by thousands of peaceful protesters opposing racial inequity and police brutality. She said at a news conference that the city is working with the community to bring the “Capitol Hill Occupied Protest” zone, or CHOP, to an end and that police soon would move back into a precinct building they had largely abandoned in the area. Durkan also vowed to address some of the protesters’ demands, including investing more in Black communities, reimagining policing in cooperation with community leaders, and pushing for accountability measures and statewide reform of police unions.The mayor did not give an immediate timeline for clearing out the occupation but said “additional steps” would be examined if people don’t leave voluntarily. With scores of people camping in a park in the protest zone, Durkan said peaceful demonstrations could continue, but nighttime disorder had to stop.“The cumulative impacts of the gatherings and protests and the nighttime atmosphere and violence has led to increasingly difficult circumstances for our businesses and residents,” Durkan said. “The impacts have increased and the safety has decreased.”A shooting Sunday night was the second in less than 48 hours at the edge of the zone, which is named for the Capitol Hill neighborhood near downtown Seattle and emerged during nationwide protests over the killing of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police.The 17-year-old victim was shot in the arm and declined to speak with detectives, police said. Gunfire early Saturday left a 19-year-old man dead and another person critically wounded.The victims were taken to a hospital by volunteer medics in private cars, and police said they were met by a hostile crowd that prevented them from immediately getting to the scene.It was not apparent if the shootings had anything to do with the protest — gunfire sometimes occurs in the neighborhood, especially on warm summer nights.Protesters cordoned off the several-block area near the police’s East Precinct after Seattle riot squads unleashed tear gas, pepper spray and flash-bangs on large crowds of mostly peaceful protesters, drawing condemnation from many city leaders and a federal court order temporarily banning the use of the weapons on demonstrators. After police largely abandoned the building, protesters took over the area — with demonstrators painting a large “Black Lives Matter” mural on the street, handing out free food, playing music and planting a community garden. Its existence incensed Trump, who criticized Durkan and Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, both Democrats.Peace has prevailed during the day. On Monday, people lounged on the turf at a park, while volunteers handed out food, water and toiletries. Artists painted designs on wooden barricades, and a few candles burned in front of a sign on the police building listing people killed by officers.At night, however, the atmosphere has become more charged, with demonstrators marching and armed volunteer guards keeping watch.",
    "Symone Sanders assails Trump for talking about slowing down coronavirus testing.Symone Sanders, senior adviser to Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, slammed into President Donald Trump's Saturday return rally, saying it set a dangerous example amid the coronavirus pandemic.Sanders on “Fox News Sunday” decried Trump's statement during the Tulsa rally that he asked the administration to slow down coronavirus testing to contain optics of a growing outbreak. She also lambasted Trump for holding a rally in a confined, indoor space — creating conditions that health experts say are highly conducive to transmitting the disease.\"The most damning thing from that rally last night, Chris, was, in fact, the president's admission that he quote unquote said to his people to slow down the testing,\" Sanders told host Chris Wallace. \"This is an appalling attempt to lessen the numbers only to make them look good.\"The White House subsequently told NBC News and Reuters that Trump was only joking with the remark. Sanders grimaced at the claim and appeared unconvinced.Sanders also defended protesters who have flooded the streets of cities across the country in the weeks since the killing of George Floyd. Trump's allies have been quick to criticize the protesters and their defenders for forming large gatherings, while the president's supporters have been blasted for gathering for his Oklahoma rally.Sanders said the protesters were exercising their rights as citizens to demand the end to police brutality, while saying that Trump was flouting his own administration's health recommendations for political gains. \"There is no double standard here. Protesting is an American right,\" Sanders said.\"The president has to lead,\" Sanders said. \"And President Trump has demonstrated so many times in every sense of the word that he is unable to do so.\"Sanders also pointed out the ways Biden has campaigned while respecting CDC guidelines for containing the spread of coronavirus. She cited interviews with local news media and virtual campaign events.Trump's rally Saturday was his first since taking a three-month hiatus due to the coronavirus pandemic. ",
    "The Albert Pike statue has been a source of controversy over the years. Protesters toppled the only statue of a Confederate general in the nation's capital and set it on fire on Juneteenth, the day marking the end of slavery in the United States, amid continuing anti-racism demonstrations following the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis.Cheering demonstrators jumped up and down as the 11-foot statue of Albert Pike — wrapped with chains — wobbled on its high granite pedestal before falling backward, landing in a pile of dust. Protesters then set a bonfire and stood around it in a circle as the statue burned, chanting, “No justice, no peace!” and “No racist police!”Eyewitness accounts and videos posted on social media indicated that police were on the scene but didn’t intervene. President Donald Trump quickly tweeted about the toppling, calling out D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser and writing: “The DC police are not doing their job as they watched a statue be ripped down and burn. These people should be immediately arrested. A disgrace to our Country!\"Jubilant protesters read out Trump’s tweet over a bullhorn and cheered. After the statue fell, most protesters returned peacefully to Lafayette Park near the White House.The Pike statue has been a source of controversy over the years. The former Confederate general was also a longtime influential leader of the Freemasons, who revere Pike and who paid for the statue. Pike’s body is interred at the D.C. headquarters of the Scottish Rite of Freemasonry, which also contains a small museum in his honor.The statue, dedicated in 1901, was located in Judiciary Square about half a mile from the U.S. Capitol. It was built at the request of Masons who successfully lobbied Congress to grant them land for the statue as long as Pike would be depicted in civilian, not military, clothing.Racial tensions in the country hit a boiling point and spilled into the streets after Floyd's killing late last month. Video showed a white police officer pressing his knee against Floyd's neck for nearly eight minutes as the handcuffed Black man said, “I can't breathe.” The officer, Derek Chauvin, has been charged with murder.Civil rights activists and some local government officials in D.C. had campaigned for years to get the statue taken down but needed the federal government's approval to do so.“Ever since 1992, members of the DC Council have been calling on the federal gov’t to remove the statue of Confederate Albert Pike (a federal memorial on federal land). We unanimously renewed our call to Congress to remove it in 2017,\" the D.C. Council tweeted Friday.A proposed resolution calling for the removal of the statue referred to Pike as a “chief founder of the post-Civil War Ku Klux Klan.\" The Klan connection is a frequent accusation from Pike's critics and one which the Masons dispute.",
    "While some of the cases are unquestionably grave, others have raised questions about whether the federal government is stretching its authority to satisfy President Donald Trump.For decades, criminal justice experts have debated the wisdom of “broken windows” policing — but no one ever proposed bringing in the FBI to do it.Until now.As part of a Justice Department-led drive to crack down on violence growing out of protests spurred by George Floyd’s killing at the hands of Minneapolis police, the federal government is prosecuting more than 70 people for alleged behavior that runs the gamut from mere vandalism, to inciting looting through Facebook Live posts, to arson, and, in one case, murder. While some of the cases are unquestionably grave, others seem less so, and have raised questions about whether the federal government is stretching its authority to satisfy President Donald Trump’s desire to see a forceful federal intervention in the protests.Two cases, for instance, involve individuals facing federal felony charges for breaking police car windows, relying on federal statutes not often applied in such instances. In another case, federal authorities charged a man with possession of a Molotov cocktail, arguing that because he had used an imported bottle of Patron Citronge Pineapple Tequila to make the incendiary device, the case fell under the federal government’s regulation of foreign commerce.Critics say the use of federal courts, prosecutors and the FBI to target crimes stemming from the recent protests is largely unnecessary and is at odds with the Constitution’s limited role for the federal government and federal law enforcement.“I think most of these crimes, even these sorts of local crimes, even local riots, the Constitution leaves to state jurisdiction,” said Ilya Somin, a professor at George Mason University’s Scalia Law School. “State and local authorities are in a better position to handle this, and they appear to be handling it. The violence and looting has in fact been stopped almost everywhere almost entirely through the applications of state and local authorities.”Since the first days of the recent protests, Trump has repeatedly taken to Twitter to call for “LAW & ORDER,” pushed governors to be more forceful against any unrest and even urged use of deadly force against looters. He also has explicitly endorsed aggressive use of federal statutes.“Crossing State lines to incite violence is a FEDERAL CRIME!” Trump tweeted late last month. “Liberal Governors and Mayors must get MUCH tougher or the Federal Government will step in and do what has to be done, and that includes using the unlimited power of our Military.”Somin said he believes federal officials, including Attorney General William Barr, are responding to the political imperative Trump sees to use federal power to quell any disturbances. “Trump and Barr want to trumpet themselves as law and order people,” he said. “Bringing some people up on federal charges can help with that even if, as in this case, there are people in the state that are capable of prosecuting.”While prosecutors describe the defendants’ activities ominously, there are early signs that some judges do not see them all that way. In some instances, judges have freed the defendants to await trial at home, over the objections of Justice Department attorneys.One prominent example of a controversial federal case spurred from an incident on May 31, when protesters rallying against police brutality took to the streets of Mobile, Ala., holding a series of vigils and marches. Most were peaceful, but in the late afternoon a crowd of hundreds of people attempted to march up a ramp onto an interstate highway. Police blocked the on-ramp and a tense standoff followed.At some point, police used tear gas to disperse the crowd. In the ensuing chaos, a woman with a red bandana around her neck used a bat to break a window of a parked, empty police cruiser and ran off, according to video from a local TV station, WKRG.The woman, Tia Pugh, 21, was later arrested by Mobile police and charged with inciting a riot and criminal mischief, both misdemeanors under Alabama law. After Pugh was released on bail, the FBI and federal prosecutors stepped in, charging her with an obscure federal felony offense: interfering with a police officer in the course of “civil disorder.”The crime was one of several anti-riot provisions included in the Civil Rights Act of 1968, passed in the wake of civil unrest in cities across the U.S. in the mid-1960s.“I consider it a very weak case,” Pugh’s court-appointed lawyer, Gordon Armstrong, said in an interview. “This is just a 21-year-old, impressionable, proud, young woman with no criminal record who’s never been arrested. She did something dumb. Does she need to have a federal felony follow her around for the rest of her life?”After Pugh’s arrest on the state charges, she spoke briefly to reporters as she was walked in handcuffs past cameras to a waiting police car. \"Genocide is happening. We're being murdered in the streets for no absolutely no reason and unarmed. We're being disarmed when we arm ourselves,” Pugh said.“Why do you think that helps your cause, by breaking a window?” a reporter asked.\"This is not the point,” Pugh replied, arguing the focus on the window was “a distraction.”The Justice Department is also invoking the same rarely used “civil disorder” statute to prosecute a Washington state man, Aaron Wood, 21, for breaking a police car window during a roving protest in Wilmington, Del., on May 30.The federal complaint says Wood threw a brick through the back window of an occupied Wilmington police cruiser during an evening of protests and violence that included the looting of a number of stores in the city’s downtown area.Wood was initially arrested by Wilmington police, released because of a computer failure and then rearrested on state charges, the affidavit says.“Peaceful protest does not extend to the lawless destruction of private or public property,” U.S. Attorney David Weiss said in a news release. “Thankfully, the defendant’s violent actions did not result in physical harm to the [Wilmington Police Department] officer driving the police car attacked by the defendant. I commend WPD’s collaboration with the FBI and their efforts to quickly identify and bring the defendant to justice.”Asked about criticism that federal prosecutors are overreaching in some cases, the Justice Department defended its decisions.“U.S. attorneys are vested with the clear discretion and authority to bring federal charges where they are warranted by facts and the law,” a DOJ spokesman said. “They are also the chief law enforcement officers in their districts and have worked together with federal, state and local law enforcement to hold those accountable who have exploited a legitimate protest movement to seed chaos and commit crimes.”Weiss, the U.S. attorney in Delaware, said in a statement to POLITICO: “My office will continue, as it always has, to carefully consider and exercise its discretion and authority to prosecute violations of federal law in support of public safety.” A spokesperson for the U.S. Attorney in Mobile, Richard Moore, declined to comment.Justice Department guidelines detail a series of factors for federal prosecutors to consider when deciding whether to bring charges in a case that can be or is being prosecuted by local authorities.“When it appears that the federal interest in prosecution is less substantial than the interest of local, state, or foreign authorities, consideration should be given to referring the case to those authorities rather than commencing or recommending a federal prosecution,” the DOJ policy says.Like many other federal laws, the “civil disorder” statute uses a connection to interstate commerce as a hook for federal jurisdiction. Under the Constitution’s Commerce Clause, the federal government has authority to regulate activities that impact either foreign or interstate commerce. Prosecutors allege the Alabama and Delaware protests impeded interstate commerce in the form of traffic on interstate highways and that the Wilmington unrest also did so through damage to businesses in that city.However, Pugh’s attorney Armstrong says that connection is shaky in her case. Protesters never made it onto the highway. Prosecutors say commerce was affected because drivers of trucks bearing hazardous materials were told to divert in case the protesters made it onto the interstate.At a court hearing last week, Armstrong questioned an FBI agent about whether any trucks actually diverted during the demonstration. The agent had a letter from an Alabama highway official confirming the directive to divert, but no proof anyone was affected.“I spent quite a bit of time on: Is there evidence any truck was diverted? The answer to that is, ‘No,’” he said. “If they can’t show commerce was in any way affected, then it’s no longer a federal matter. That’s the real issue in the case, not whether she broke a window.”At the hearing, U.S. Magistrate Judge Bradley Murray said there was enough evidence to let the case against Pugh proceed, but he said prosecutors would need more to press forward with the case, according to Armstrong. The judge also ordered Pugh’s release over the objections of prosecutors.Unlike the demonstrators in Mobile, some of the protesters in Wilmington actually made it onto the interstate, blocking I-95 for about an hour. However, the shattering of the police cruiser window that led to the federal case against Wood took place roughly an hour after the demonstrators left the highway.Among the prominent lawyers and policymakers who have warned about the federal government using the Commerce Clause to claim expansive power is Barr.“The Framers believed in the principle of subsidiarity — that is, that matters ought to be handled by the smallest, lowest competent authority that was closest to the people,” Barr said in February at a conference for religious broadcasters. “The Framers conceived that the vast majority of collective decision-making by the people about their affairs would be done at the state and local level.”Barr directly criticized the federal government’s reliance on the Commerce Clause, saying it has “ballooned far beyond its original understanding.”Despite the warnings from Barr and some legal academics, the Supreme Court has endorsed the federal government’s power to intervene in situations with marginal impact on interstate commerce, though it has occasionally ruled that measures go too far.Other recent cases have taken a different tack as establishing federal jurisdiction: arguing that defendants used the internet to foment illegal activity.Prosecutors grabbed headlines earlier this month when they arrested Ca’Quintez Gibson, 26, on a charge of using the internet to incite a riot. Gibson was accused of making a series of Facebook Live posts encouraging looting at a large, indoor shopping mall in Peoria, Ill., as well as at a strip mall and other locations.“It’s going up tonight. Long as you all at Northwoods Mall. It’s going up. Period. ’cause I know it’s more than just me gonna step. Period,” Gibson said in one video. “We ain’t with that peaceful s---.”Following Gibson’s arrest, U.S. Attorney for Central Illinois John Milhiser, said it was important to put people like Gibson behind bars. “We will use all available resources to identify bad actors and get them off the streets to keep our communities safe,” Milhiser said.However, just five days later, a magistrate judge ordered Gibson released on a fairly lax form of home detention, with permission to work, attend church and other activities. He was ordered to stay off the internet and keep away from any devices with access to the web.Federal charges can also bring harsher potential sentences. The rarely invoked charge of using “a facility of interstate … commerce” to incite a riot carries a maximum penalty of up to five years in prison and fine of as much as $250,000. Most federal defendants get shorter sentences under federal sentencing guidelines.And a man charged this week with throwing a burning glove under a New York Police Department cruiser, Victor Sanchez-Santa, is facing a five-year mandatory minimum and a total of as much as 20 years in prison if convicted on a federal arson charge. Prosecutors say the matter can be prosecuted in federal court because the NYPD receives federal funds. Others, including two Brooklyn lawyers, face 50-year mandatory minimums if convicted on a slew of federal charges stemming from arson attacks on NYPD cars during recent unrest.The then-U.S. Attorney in Manhattan, Geoffrey Berman, said in a statement Thursday that arson deserves serious prosecution because it involves serious danger.“Arson is … a threat to more than its immediate victim, with the potential to destroy and terrify far beyond the place where a fire is set,” Berman said.Leah Nylen and Betsy Woodruff Swan contributed to this report.",
    "G.T. Bynum’s faltering efforts on police reform took a hit after George Floyd’s killing. It hasn’t gotten any easier with President Trump coming to town. TULSA, Oklahoma—By almost any measure, this has been a terrible month for Tulsa Mayor G. T. Bynum.Like almost every other city in America, Tulsa was the scene of major protests after the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis sparked major protests. Demonstrators tried to take over an interstate highway and some even marched to Bynum’s house, an act he called “intimidation.” In a city that was the site of the nation’s most notorious massacre of black residents, hundreds of whom were murdered in their homes by a white mob, the mayor’s insinuation that he felt threatened by unarmed protesters didn’t sit well with the black community.It only got worse. Bynum, a mild-mannered 43-year-old with tortoise-shell glasses, gave an interview on national television that downplayed the role of race in a widely publicized police shooting. No sooner had he apologized for his “dumb and overly simplistic” comment than one of his highest-ranking officers said police should statistically be shooting more black people “based on the crimes committed.”In the middle of all this, President Donald Trump, whose provocative rhetoric after Floyd’s death inflamed tensions across the country, announced he would come to Tulsa to hold his first rally since the coronavirus pandemic had interrupted his public campaigning. Bynum, a moderate Republican, has stressed he had nothing to do with Trump’s visit, but he resisted repeated calls to cancel the rally at the 19,000-seat BOK Center in downtown. He did not respond to interview requests made to his office. In a public statement, he said that an event in the middle of a spike in Covid-19 cases “isn’t ideal.” Now Tulsa, population just under 400,000, is preparing for the arrival of tens of thousands of Trump supporters and counter-protesters. High steel fencing lines streets through downtown, which Bynum placed under curfew starting Thursday night in fear that “organized groups who have been involved in destructive and violent behavior in other States are planning to travel to the City of Tulsa for purposes of causing unrest in and around the rally.” Trump torqued up the tension Friday morning with a tweet threat: “Any protesters, anarchists, agitators, looters or lowlifes who are going to Oklahoma please understand, you will not be treated like you have been in New York, Seattle, or Minneapolis.”Whatever happens over the coming hours and days is unlikely to make Bynum’s job easier. Even before Floyd’s death spurred the Black Lives Matter movement into overdrive, Bynum found himself in a political vise increasingly familiar to mayors in cities across the conservative heart of the country. He represents a city where Republicans outnumber Democrats by about 2 to 1. But over the course of his four years in office, Bynum has made conscious efforts to reform a police department that arrests black people at twice the rate of white people and that has been condemned for controversial killings of black men. In February, Bynum appointed Tulsa’s first black police chief. But like so much in the Bynum administration, the move has failed to resonate with some black voters, who regard Police Chief Wendell Franklin as a police force insider rather than a true agent of change. In recent days, the pace of that change, and Bynum’s commitment to it, has come into question as the mayor has tried to mediate a fraught negotiation about civilian oversight of the police. Almost everyone involved—the police union and Black Lives Matter supporters—have expressed feelings of betrayal by the mayor whom they accuse of flip-flopping on the issue. At a Wednesday news conference, Franklin said, “The eyes of the world are upon us now. We are ready.” Bynum’s leadership of Tulsa once had a sense of destiny. His uncle, grandfather and great-great grandfather all held the same position. Elected in the summer of 2016, Bynum seemed eager to bridge racial divides that have lingered for nearly a century. He declared he wanted “One Tulsa,” and launched a fact-gathering mission to quantify racial disparities in such areas as policing, education and housing, and created the Mayor’s Office of Resilience and Equity to pilot reforms. Then, just weeks after he was elected, a white female officer shot and killed Terence Crutcher, an unarmed black man who had stopped his car in the middle of the road. The shooting was captured on video by a circling police helicopter. The officer was charged with manslaughter. There was a flurry of national attention but in the black community the outrage never disappeared. Then in 2017, it happened again. Tulsa County deputies shot Joshua Barre, a mentally ill 29-year-old black man who was wandering the street with two knives. Only three weeks before, the officer who shot Crutcher had been acquitted.Bynum, meanwhile, promoted economic investment in the predominantly black neighborhoods of North Tulsa. And, to address long-standing fear and anger from black residents toward the Tulsa Police Department, Bynum proposed in January 2019 establishing an Office of Independent Monitor to provide oversight, based on a model he admired in Denver.The mayor also responded to the request of leaders in the black community, such as the Rev. Robert Turner, to create a commission to investigate the whereabouts of mass graves from the 1921 massacre and placed the pastor on the commission. City officials and community leaders hoped bodies could be exhumed and given a proper burial for the centennial anniversary next year.“I think the mayor has done a good job of engaging that, more so than any mayor I can remember in Tulsa,” said Corbin Brewster, the chief public defender of Tulsa County. “Then you have Trump announce he’s going to have a rally. ... That just magnifies all those fissures and second guessing and pressure on our city officials.”But others feel the problems are self-inflicted. The Office of Independent Monitor stalled after pressure from the police union and disagreement over details among City Council and activists.And Turner nearly quit the committee charged with overseeing the survey and excavation of mass graves from the massacre because of how slowly the city was moving and how narrowly it conducted its search. The work is now on pause indefinitely as a result of the pandemic, even though the state has largely opened up. But the days after the George Floyd killing have been especially challenging for Bynum, who has seemed to pinball between defensiveness and stubborn insistence on “law and order.”Not long after he complained of “intimidation” by activists, Bynum appeared on a conservative talk radio show on June 1. He continued his criticism while defending law enforcement. Within the day, however, he met with the activists, including Turner, and agreed to a number of their demands, such as ending LivePD in Tulsa, a reality law-enforcement show featuring local cops on the beat. He agreed to meet with the Crutcher family, who had filed a civil lawsuit against the city, and to renew his push for the Office of Independent Monitor.Conservatives accused him of flip-flopping. Jerad Lindsey, chairman of the Tulsa Fraternal Order of Police, described himself as “completely blindsided.” He added that the mayor owed the police officers of Tulsa an explanation. Meanwhile, public relations disasters kept exploding around Bynum. On June 8, Maj. Travis Yates of the Tulsa Police Department, made national headlines with his remark on local talk radio that police were “shooting African Americans about 24 percent less than we ought to be, based on the crimes being committed.” The mayor condemned the comments, but Yates kept his job, pending an internal investigation. Shortly thereafter, Tulsa police made national news again, this time with a video of police officers roughly arresting black teenagers for walking in a street. In the midst of this, Bynum appeared on “CBS Sunday Morning” in a segment about the historical racial strife in Tulsa, saying that it was drug use rather than race that played a factor in the killing of Terence Crutcher. “After meeting with the mayor and thinking we were moving in the right direction, we hear him make those egregious comments,” said Tiffany Crutcher, the twin sister of Terence who has risen to prominence in Tulsa as an activist after creating the Terence Crutcher Foundation to advocate for civil rights. “I was nauseated.”Bynum apologized. “When your friends start calling you and repeatedly use the phrase ‘I know your heart’, it is a good indicator you’ve screwed up,” he wrote on Twitter. But the damage was done. Within days, Tiffany Crutcher recruited a board member of her foundation, Greg Robinson, to run for office against Bynum in August, bringing the total challengers to seven. “This is part of our three-year push for change,” Crutcher said. “We just felt we needed to take it to the next level.” Crutcher is his campaign manager. Meanwhile, the Fraternal Order of Police isn’t forgetting Bynum’s remarks, either. Lindsey told me the mayor has “not yet” but is close to losing support of the police. “We are giving him a lot of latitude because Tulsa is a unique place and this is a unique time in history.” Still, the police union opposes his proposal for the Office of Independent Monitor, arguing that it will result in less policing, not better policing. Lindsey said the cops in Denver told him they work in fear of residents reporting them to the city’s OIM for doing their jobs. “What is the easiest way to not get a complaint?” he asks. “Not to engage. You have guys sitting in parking lots; they don’t drive neighborhoods.” A five-minute drive in Tulsa can take you from the growing camp of defiant Trump supporters at the BOK Center to a place that feels both far away and uncomfortably close: the Vernon Chapel A.M.E. Church, which was burned in the 1921 Black Wall Street massacre that killed some 300 black Tulsans. The church was soon rebuilt, but it now needs millions in repairs it can’t afford. Annual revenue is $200,000 per year, and the congregation is elderly and few—just 135 worshippers. “I know churches with Sunday School classes larger than our whole membership,” Pastor Turner told me this week. “But God chose us to be his vessel.” Turner, 37, keeps a bullhorn and a sign at his desk that reads in all caps: REPARATIONS NOW. He has led the fight to identify and excavate the mass graves of victims of the Tulsa race massacre and secure compensation for their descendants, many of whom make up his congregation. His church is responding to Trump’s presence by hosting two rallies: one on Friday, the anniversary of Juneteenth, the celebration of the symbolic end of chattel slavery in 1865, and the other one opposite the president’s rally on Saturday evening. Raising the profile of the event, is the Rev. Al Sharpton, who is flying in to deliver an address Friday night. Meanwhile, the Trump campaign is claiming so much enthusiasm that it has rented a second venue near the BOK Center for an overflow crowd. “Unless he has changed his political strategy, I’m concerned that [Trump] is going to charge them up,” said Turner. “His last campaign was very high on vitriol and bombast. So you get filled with that for however long he’s going to speak, and God knows what those folks are going to want to do.”The National Guard has been activated, but Turner is worried enough that he is not counting on them or local police alone to keep the peace. So he has hired private security for his rally. “As a Christian, I do not worry,” Turner says. “As a human being, I have concerns. I just pray to God to protect us. I know he can. I pray he will.”CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story misstated the anniversary of the Juneteenth celebration.",
    "Mayor Greg Fisher said interim Louisville police Chief Robert Schroeder has started termination proceedings for Officer Brett Hankison.Louisville's mayor said Friday that one of three police officers involved in the fatal shooting of Breonna Taylor will be fired.Mayor Greg Fisher said interim Louisville police Chief Robert Schroeder has started termination proceedings for Officer Brett Hankison. Two other officers remain on administrative reassignment while the shooting is investigated.Fischer said officials could not answer questions about the firing because of state law. He referred all questions to the Jefferson County attorney's office.Taylor, who was black, was shot eight times by officers who burst into her Louisville home using a no-knock warrant during a March 13 narcotics investigation. No drugs were found at her home.A letter the chief sent to Hankison said the officer violated standard operating procedures when he “wantonly and blindly fired 10 rounds into the apartment of Breonna Taylor.”The letter says he fired the rounds “without supporting facts” that the deadly force was directed at a person posing an immediate threat.“In fact, the 10 rounds you fired were into a patio door and window which were covered with material that completely prevented you from verifying any person as an immediate threat or more importantly any innocent persons present,\" the letter states.I find your conduct a shock to the conscience,\" Schroeder said in the letter. “Your actions have brought discredit upon yourself and the Department.”Sam Aguiar, an attorney for Taylor’s family said the move was overdue.“It’s about damn time. It should have happened a long time ago, but thankfully it’s at least happening now,” Aguiar said. \"This is an officer that’s plagued our streets and made this city worse for over a dozen years. ... Let’s hope that this is a start to some good, strong criminal proceedings against Officer Hankison, because he definitely deserves to at least be charged.”The warrant to search Taylor’s home was in connection with a suspect who did not live there. Police used a “no-knock” search warrant, which allows them to enter without first announcing their presence. Louisville’s Metro Council recently voted to ban the use of no-knock warrants.The release in late May of a 911 call by Taylor’s boyfriend marked the beginning of days of protests in Louisville, fueled by Taylor’s death and the death of George Floyd in police custody in Minneapolis.Beyonce recently joined the call for charges against the officers involved in Taylor’s shooting. The superstar said in a letter to Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron that the three Louisville police officers “must be held accountable for their actions.”",
    "The president’s top advisers repeatedly referenced the potential for violence on the streets this weekend.President Donald Trump on Friday threatened to thwart protesters and others who might seek to sabotage his rally this weekend in Tulsa, Okla. — echoing the hard-line rhetoric he has employed in response to mass demonstrations across the country against police brutality and racial injustice.“Any protesters, anarchists, agitators, looters or lowlifes who are going to Oklahoma please understand, you will not be treated like you have been in New York, Seattle, or Minneapolis,” Trump wrote on Twitter. “It will be a much different scene!”Trump, who does not control local law enforcement in Oklahoma, did not elaborate on what type of resistance those who gather in opposition to his presence in Tulsa might encounter.The president’s social media post comes after Tulsa Mayor G.T. Bynum issued an executive order Thursday declaring a civil emergency and imposing curfews for parts of downtown to be in effect before and after Trump’s rally Saturday in the city’s 19,000-seat BOK Center and a 40,000-capacity convention center nearby.However, on Friday afternoon Trump announced the curfew would be lifted on Friday night and Saturday night for supporters attending the rally.\"Enjoy yourselves - thank you to Mayor Bynum!\" Trump wrote on Twitter, adding the mayor informed him of the change in plans.The Trump campaign received another boost Friday afternoon when the Oklahoma Supreme Court ruled that Saturday's in-person rally could go ahead as planned. The court dismissed a lawsuit filed earlier this week that argued social distancing and mask wearing should be required at the rally.In his previous executive order, Bynum also revealed he had “received information from the Tulsa Police Department and other law enforcement agencies that shows that individuals from organized groups who have been involved in destructive and violent behavior in other States are planning to travel to the City of Tulsa for purposes of causing unrest in and around the rally.”Bynum noted that protests have already “been planned in response to” Trump’s rally, and black community leaders have expressed fears about episodes of violence resulting from the campaign event — which overlaps with a two-day local celebration of Juneteenth, a holiday commemorating the end of slavery in the United States.The rally was initially scheduled to take place Friday on Juneteenth, but Trump last week announced it would instead be held Saturday after facing significant criticism for the initial choice of date. Trump was also roundly rebuked for the campaign’s decision to organize the rally in Tulsa, the city where white mobs in 1921 burned a prosperous black community in what has come to be considered among the worst incidents of racial violence in American history.White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany did not specify Friday which punitive actions Trump was alluding to in his tweet, and denied that he was arguing the constitutional right to peaceably assemble should not apply to his rallies.“What the president was noting is that there were inexcusable scenes that we saw play out in New York and Seattle and Minneapolis, and that we would not see Tulsa, Oklahoma, look that way,” she told reporters at a White House press briefing.McEnany also asserted Trump’s vague threat was not intended to apply to all protesters, such as those gathering peacefully. “What he was meaning are violent protesters, anarchists [and] looters,” she said.Trump has advocated an aggressive, militaristic approach to quash nationwide protests and riots in the aftermath of the killing of George Floyd, a 46-year-old black man, by Minneapolis police in May.Earlier this month, Trump threatened to deploy active-duty troops to put an end to the racial unrest, while police officers and National Guard troops violently dispersed largely peaceful protesters in front of the White House to clear the way for a presidential photo opportunity in front of a church.Marc Lotter, director of strategic communications for the president’s reelection campaign, defended Trump’s tweet Friday, telling MSNBC that “if we see what we’ve seen in other cities with rioting, looting, setting buildings on fire and physical violence, then that’s going to be something that would be met by police, and it would be handled appropriately.” Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale played down concerns of a confrontation. “I’ve been here since Day One, and I found all Trump supporters to be really caring, loving people that care about this country,” he told Fox News.Parscale also claimed, however, the campaign was aware of “people coming in that are trying to disrupt” and “trying to create scenes” at Saturday’s rally. The protesters, he argued, “want that moment where CNN or some other fake news media can try to make it look like a Trump supporter is not a loving and caring person.”Lara Trump, a senior adviser to the Trump campaign and the president’s daughter-in-law, similarly insisted that “Trump supporters are, by and large, very peaceful people.” But she nevertheless lamented that “anybody would ever consider doing this just to cause chaos and destruction and violence.” “I just think it’s such a shame that anyone would hijack anything,” she told Fox News. “You saw how these agitators hijacked the peaceful protest, and they turned them into riots and into burning down buildings and destroying small businesses, and it devolved into violence very quickly.” Later Friday morning, the president’s focus appeared to shift away from potential conflict as he returned to his frequent fixation on his rallies’ attendance levels. “Big crowds and lines already forming in Tulsa. My campaign hasn’t started yet. It starts on Saturday night in Oklahoma!” Trump tweeted — even though his campaign billed a June 2019 event in Orlando as its official 2020 kickoff.Still, the repeated references by the president and his top political aides to the possibility of a clash on the streets of Tulsa ratcheted up anxieties related to Saturday’s rally — Trump’s first since the end of widespread coronavirus lockdown orders.Oklahoma reported 450 new COVID-19 cases Thursday, a record for the state, and public health officials have warned attendees are at a heightened risk of contracting the disease in densely packed convention centers.Organizers will provide temperature checks, masks and hand sanitizer before the event to rallygoers, who are required to pledge not to sue the Trump campaign should they become infected.",
    "City budget fights pit activists against Democratic politicians.The liberal push to \"defund the police\" has drawn predictable scorn from conservatives and resistance from more moderate Democrats, including the party’s presumptive presidential nominee, Joe Biden. But there’s a more significant obstacle to the growing movement on the left: Democratic politicians in the country’s deep-blue cities. Many of the cities with the highest number of law enforcement per capita on the payroll are urban areas with progressive mayors — including many women and people of color — and Democratic majorities on the city council. That means local leaders in cities like Washington, New York and Atlanta have the power to limit funding for some of the nation’s largest police forces and reallocate that money for programs to shrink the wealth gap and provide stable housing, access to jobs and health care.But even in those liberal bastions, the movement is running into resistance.“These are very blue places, yet we’re still seeing this kind of dynamic with police spending skyrocketing and cuts to community resources and community-led programs,” said Kumar Rao, director of justice transformation at the Center for Popular Democracy, a liberal Brooklyn-based advocacy group. “This is a political issue on one level, but it’s actually very much a bipartisan problem.”In the nation’s capital, Mayor Muriel Bowser had “BLACK LIVES MATTER” painted on the street leading to the White House after federal officers forcibly cleared out protesters with tear gas and rubber bullets to make way for a presidential photo op outside a historic church. A day later, Black Lives Matter activists painted “DEFUND THE POLICE” next to the original message.Bowser, however, has proposed a 3.3 percent increase, to $578 million, in police spending in the city's fiscal year 2021 budget. She told NPR last week that she was “not at all” reconsidering her position.“We fund the police at the level that we need it funded,” she said.That stance is at odds, however, with the city council, which has been inundated by the public outcry for police reform. Dozens of public witnesses testified at a six-hour virtual Metropolitan Police Department budget oversight hearing Monday in opposition to increased police spending.More than 500 had people signed up to testify, and members of the public submitted more than 15,000 written, video and phone submissions, the local news site DCist reported, noting that the list of speakers was cut off due to time constraints. In contrast, only 22 people spoke at last year’s police budget hearing. “The theme was clear in the testimony, which was a call to evaluate the budget of the Metropolitan Police Department, make appropriate cuts and redirect the funding to meet the needs of residents that have suffered from over-policing and other government disinvestment,” said Kenyan McDuffie, a member of the D.C. Council and chair pro tempore.In a phone interview, McDuffie told POLITICO the council has been responsive to the public’s suggestions and is “likely” to cut the police department’s budget to reinvest in the community’s priorities, despite Bowser’s opposition. He noted that the council unanimously passed a series of police reforms last week but warned that police reform is only one step in dismantling systemic racism and structural inequities.The budget process is continuing to play out in D.C., with budget markups set for next week. The full council is scheduled to hold its first vote on the budget on July 7, and the final vote is expected July 28.The District is just one of dozens of cities from the East Coast to the West Coast grappling with the message behind the “defund police” motto. To critics, it’s a literal call to bankrupt and abolish police departments. But to many leaders, it’s a call to reform policing; rethink when, where and how police should be deployed; cut police budgets; and invest more money in communities, instead of in policing communities.\"You ask people what does defunding the police mean — you ask three people, you’ll get three different opinions,\" Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti told California Playbook in a virtual interview Tuesday. “But I think what is crystal clear to all of us is that we are underfunding black communities — whether it’s economic development, whether it’s education, whether it’s health — and other communities of color.”Garcetti said he supported a reevaluation of police funding but did not embrace calls to fully defund or dismantle police departments.Rashad Robinson, executive director of the racial justice organization Color of Change, noted that activists across the country are seeing a movement of cities beginning to examine their budgets more closely amid calls to defund police.“Budgets are moral documents, right? They say what our values are,” he said. “Beyond any rhetoric, beyond words, they tell the story of what we actually hope to achieve by what we put money in, and far too often, when we have problems in our society, we seek to solve them with people with guns.”Hundreds of residents and activists have flooded virtual council meetings in city after city with calls to defund and reform police departments. According to a POLITICO analysis of city budgets, crime statistics and census data, there’s no direct correlation between police spending and crime. The grassroots energy overwhelming city councils comes in the wake of George Floyd’s killing at the hands of a white Minneapolis police officer on May 25. Floyd’s death led to global protests against police brutality and racism, and “defund the police” — an idea decades in the making — became a rallying cry. Minneapolis’ city council has since unanimously passed a resolution to disband its police department and replace it after a year of research and community engagement. But Mayor Jacob Frey and Police Chief Medaria Arradondo want to reform the department rather than dismantle it.In New York, Mayor Bill de Blasio earlier this month pledged to cut the police department’s funding. De Blasio failed to specify how much he would curb spending, but the city council is eying a cut of nearly 20 percent after calling for a 7 percent reduction weeks earlier. The council has a July 1 deadline to pass a budget.Atlanta’s city council has a special meeting to adopt its budget Friday, a week after 27-year-old Rayshard Brooks was fatally shot by police outside a Wendy’s drive-thru. Monday’s nearly 12-hour council meeting included the playing of nearly 500 public comments that were submitted. The council approved two resolutions urging the city and the state Legislature to adopt policies implementing comprehensive police reform and calling for a report of recommendations for the city’s approach to public safety, including systematic changes to policies and reinventing the culture of policing, to be submitted by Dec. 1.Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, a contender to become Biden’s running mate who signed an order this week to reform the police department’s use of force, has said Atlanta is ahead of the curve because it’s already in the process of reallocating public safety funds. But the city council is poised to add about $12 million to the police department’s budget when it votes Friday, according to Felicia Moore, the council’s president. Moore told POLITICO that city officials had pledged last year to increase police spending for four years following a study by the Atlanta Police Foundation that found Atlanta officers were paid well below the median rates. “I can’t speak for what their votes will be, but I would tend to think that reneging on a promise to keep our salaries competitive would be something that they wouldn’t want to do,” Moore said. “All the money’s not gonna be spent on the day that we adopt a budget,” she added. “They may go back and revisit the budget and make some adjustments. I just think the issue came up in a time frame that doesn’t give the council a full opportunity to make the decision” to defund the police department right now.",
    "The withdrawal reflected her trademark pragmatism and Democrats' belief that the ticket needs a racial balance.Sen. Amy Klobuchar late Thursday said she personally called presumptive Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden to advise he pick a woman of color as his running mate, effectively announcing the end of her vice presidential aspirations.\"I truly believe, as I actually told the vice president last night when I called him, that I think this is a moment to put a woman of color on that ticket,\" the Minnesota Democrat told MSNBC's Lawrence O'Donnell. \"And there is so many incredibly qualified women.\"Klobuchar had long been considered a top contender for Biden's vice presidential pick, but as protests over police brutality against African Americans erupted across the country following the death of George Floyd at the hands of a Minneapolis police officer, the traditional running mate calculus was altered. Klobuchar's credentials as a former prosecutor with a tough-on-crime record didn't sit well as her home state became a locus among protests and calls for structural change in law enforcement.Two other potential Biden picks, California Sen. Kamala Harris and Florida Rep. Val Demings, also have law enforcement backgrounds. However, both are black women, have more support among African American leaders and have been more comfortable discussing issues of race, inequality and police brutality.In adding her name to the growing chorus of voices who think Biden should not pick a white woman, Klobuchar’s announcement was widely viewed by Democratic insiders as a blow to the chances of Massachusetts’ Sen Elizabeth Warren, who is a top consideration for Biden. Biden, who has not committed to picking a running mate based on race, region or ideology, has said he plans to make his decision by early August.After Klobuchar's announcement, Biden tweeted: \"Amy — from the moment you announced you were running for president in a snowstorm, it wasn't hard to see you had the grit and determination to do anything you set your mind to. You know how to get things done. With your help, we’re going to beat Donald Trump.\"Klobuchar’s withdrawal reflected her trademark pragmatism, and her statement that Biden should pick a woman of color spoke to the growing belief by Democrats, including the candidate’s allies, that his ticket needs a racial balance. That sentiment only intensified after Floyd's killing at the end of May.A POLITICO/Morning Consult poll release last week showed that found 46 percent of Democrats said it's important Biden pick a nonwhite vice presidential candidate, an increase of 10 percentage points since early April.Klobuchar had unique challenges with voters of color during her primary bid. She did little to attract black and Latino voters and she was latterly viewed with suspicion by activists against police brutality because she was a former prosecutor in Minneapolis, the city where Floyd was killed.Klobuchar’s decision to step back was immediately praised on Twitter by two of Biden’s advisers.“@amyklobuchar just withdrew from VP consideration with such grace; seizing this historical moment to commit her leadership to helping her state of Minnesota heal,” wrote adviser Karine Jean-Pierre.Biden adviser Symone Sanders praised Klobuchar’s “introspection, your passion & your insight.”Klobuchar on Thursday said she would focus on helping her home state heal after weeks of unrest and police violence directed at protesters, and cited her position on the Senate Judiciary Committee as a way forward for creating meaningful police reform.When asked by O'Donnell whether she thought the discussions of race and police brutality would remain front and center of the presidential race going forward, Klobuchar responded \"of course it will be.\"Still, Klobuchar maintained that her career in law enforcement would not have hindered her ability to run and serve well as vice president.\"I could have functioned fine and there is a lot of untruths out there about my record,\" Klobuchar said. \"And now is not the time to debate those. Some things that have been put out on there through the internet. That's just what life is in politics.\"Max Cohen contributed to this report.",
    "One America News employees say a majority of the reporters at its San Diego headquarters are liberals—and they’re chafing at their own network’s coverage of national protests and the coronavirus. As protests and riots roiled the nation in early June, a missive from the news director at President Donald Trump’s favorite network arrived in the inboxes of anchors, delivering marching orders. “I want to get everyone on the same page regarding coverage of ongoing protests and riots/looting,” Chris Schickedanz, the news director at One America News headquartered in San Diego, wrote to anchors. Among his suggestions for possible storylines: “organized riots/looting/Antifa’s actions,” as well as the “president’s response” and “justifications for deployments if local officials are unable to control.” Anchors should focus on small businesses and family owned “shops being destroyed,” “peaceful black protesters protecting white police officers” and the “black community speaking out against violence.” And, he noted, his reporters should “beware” of “narratives being pushed by mainstream media.” “We will continue to cover any violence live tonight from the studio,” Schickedanz concluded in the memo, screenshots of which an OAN anchor provided to me and were confirmed by other recipients. He added: “We want everyone working together on this and want everyone to understand our coverage plans.”One OAN anchor who read the message came away frustrated. The note, this anchor told me, had omitted a major part of the unfolding story that’s sweeping the nation during this turbulent American spring: Police brutality in response to peaceful protesters—a subject the cable network’s owners had a history of eliding in their coverage, beginning with civil unrest in Ferguson, Missouri, in 2014. “It doesn’t explicitly say not to cover police brutality, but it’s not included in the email,” said this anchor, who asked for anonymity in fear of retribution from the network’s owners. “It discourages us from striving for objectivity when covering these protests—when there’s obviously been violence on both sides.”It might be surprising that such sentiment exists in the newsroom at OAN, known as more loyal to the president than even Fox News. Founded and run by tech-business tycoon Robert Herring and his family, known as editorially tight-gripped, hands-on owners, it broadcasts to some 70 markets across the country, carrying every last minute of Trump rallies. It touts any silver lining in reelection polls for the president. And its chief White House correspondent, Chanel Rion, routinely serves up softballs for Trump during briefings. But according to four current OAN employees, including three anchors, and two former OAN producers, most of the journalists they know at the network’s headquarters consider themselves liberal. For some, taking a job at the national network was a way to leapfrog small regional broadcast jobs—a Faustian bargain they say leads to high turnover in the newsroom.“I’ve worked on every shift now (morning, afternoon and & overnight) and can objectively say there is only one or two hardcore conservatives” in the newsroom, said one anchor via text. (The anchor’s analysis didn’t include evening opinion hosts.) This dynamic is, according to several of the employees I spoke to, leading to tensions inside the newsroom as OAN makes headlines for its controversial coverage of coronavirus and the anti-racist protests. They said that in recent weeks they have felt everything from “horrified” to “defeated” at their own network’s reporting on the protests and are concerned that the management is pushing them toward increasingly conservative coverage angles. These employees said they feel pressured to cover angles that will protect network founder and CEO Robert Herring’s business investments. In recent years, Herring has become more and more concerned about the ideological leanings of his employees, according to Chris Pocock, a newswriter and producer who worked at the network for four years, beginning in 2015 and ending last March. At the same time, Herring, known by his employees as “Mr. H,” has also become more involved in the coverage. “People with left-leaning beliefs were treated with suspicion by Mr. H—though with some exceptions, hardly anyone in the newsroom agreed with the direction the newscast had taken,” Pocock, who left because he was frustrated with the network’s one-sided coverage, told me in his first-ever on-the-record interview about his time at OAN. A current network anchor told me that Herring and his son Bobby once made a list of newsroom employees and their assumed political leanings (liberal or conservative), with photos appearing next to names. The Herrings then interrogated each employee on the list as to whether that political affiliation was correct, according to that anchor, who was one of the people questioned. (Pocock said he heard about the list but was not questioned.)OAN didn’t directly address questions about that interrogation. After answering several questions about the network’s relationship to Trump, the network’s future and its coverage, OAN President Charles Herring, Robert’s son, and OAN spokeswoman Krista McClelland stopped responding to my queries. “It’s complete FALSE garbage, not worthy of legitimate reporting,” McClelland wrote me in response to several questions I asked her, but she would not clarify to which claim she was referring. McClelland also declined to provide a breakdown of the network’s total number of employees, or the number of employees at its San Diego headquarters, or New York or D.C. bureaus: “We don’t believe that other businesses would provide such information,” she said. The employees I spoke to estimate that they have about 30 newsroom colleagues in San Diego—that is where the network’s owners are based, too—and said that the New York and D.C. bureaus are much smaller. OAN did not make reporters available from the New York or D.C. bureaus. None of the six OAN employees based in New York and D.C. I contacted returned messages seeking comment. Six other San Diego employees I contacted didn’t return my messages; a seventh declined an interview. When I spent more than 14 hours watching OAN’s coronavirus coverage in May, I found that much of the content was pretty much straight down the middle—for example, an interview with former Veterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin about how the coronavirus was affecting vets—a source you might not expect, given his ouster by Trump—or dispatches on hydroxychloroquine that mention the drug isn’t approved by the Food and Drug Administration. And much of it is actually straightforward syndicated news: Throughout the day, the network runs packages from Reuters and The Associated Press. The employees I spoke to say they and their fellow progressives in San Diego are the people who read, write and produce this coverage.These reports, however, are dwarfed in attention by a smaller percentage of coverage at the network that is flagrantly pro-Trump and often veers into conspiracy territory: partisan dispatches from reporters such as Rion and the correspondent Jack Posobiec—both of whom work in the D.C. bureau—not to mention nightly opinion shows helmed by commentators like Graham Ledger and Liz Wheeler, both based in San Diego. The friction this situation creates was suddenly on display earlier this month. On Friday, June 5, a few days after the email from Schickedanz arrived in his inbox, the anchor was surprised when the network ran a package on Martin Gugino, the 75-year-old Buffalo man who was shoved by police officers and fell backward hitting his head on the concrete, blood pooling around his right ear. “TWO ‘NEW YORK STATE’ POLICE OFFICERS ARE SUSPENDED FOLLOWING AN INCIDENT THAT PUT A 75-YEAR-OLD MAN IN SERIOUS CONDITION,” read a script I obtained from a newsroom employee. An OAN anchor I spoke with believed that story had run because it hadn’t been seen by higher-ups at the network. The writer of that segment, said the anchor, drafted the script at 2 a.m. early Friday, “so there weren’t any bosses around besides the other producers.” The anchor didn’t know the writer’s identity, but could see the script was written during a 2 a.m. shift. By Sunday, OAN was reporting a far different version of the story. In this one, Kristian Rouz, a Russian reporter who reports for OAN and Russian propaganda site Sputnik, called Gugino an “ANTIFA provocateur” who was interfering with police work. It was a baseless theory. But on Tuesday morning, Trump, an avid watcher of OAN, glommed on to the conspiracy and tweeted about it. (OAN has previously said Rouz’s work for Sputnik is unrelated to his work at OAN. Rouz did not respond to a request for comment.)“When I saw the story I immediately thought, ‘this is wrong,’” an OAN anchor said of the network’s smear of Gugino. “No matter what he may have been doing, he didn’t deserve what happened to him. Why speculate when the man isn’t even in a position to defend himself after getting his skull cracked open? It’s just in poor taste.”Robert Herring seemed to double down on the conspiracy theory later in the morning, in response to criticism, tweeting: “Follow-up reporting coming later today on @OANN ! We have information to challenge those who are questioning the facts.” Unearthing even the most quotidian facts about OAN is a heavy lift. The network’s press kit is a two-page PDF with fewer than 300 words of copy. The nearly 7-year-old network doesn’t subscribe to Nielsen Media Research, so industry-standard viewership numbers aren’t available. But OAN’s fealty to the president has boosted the network as a reliable bit player in the Trump-era conservative mediasphere, ensconced among right-wing talk radio, Fox News and Sinclair Broadcasting. According to third-party set-top box data, OAN today is available in more than 35 million homes each night, giving it about a third of Fox News’ reach. The only audience data I could find were from last spring, when Nielsen briefly measured OAN’s ratings in the country’s biggest metro areas. During that time period, OAN averaged 14,000 total viewers while Fox News averaged 631,000 viewers. But OAN is growing in influence—its ratings are up by about 55 percent from a year ago, according to Charles Herring. In January, the Wall Street Journal reported that Hicks Equity Partners, a company connected to Republican National Committee co-Chair Thomas Hicks Jr., was spearheading a potential buyout of the network alongside GOP donors—a future vehicle for Trump following his presidency. Long before Chanel Rion lectured what she has called the fake news media or dished out interrogatory alley-oops to Trump during White House news conferences, OAN’s very founding came at a partisan event. At the 2013 Conservative Political Action Conference in March, Ledger walked to the podium to unveil the new network. Prior to his engagement with OAN, Ledger worked as an anchor covering hard-news headlines on another Herring Networks channel called A Wealth of Entertainment, formerly Wealth TV. “Like Fruit of the Loom, I will be brief,” he said back in 2013 at CPAC to groans. He had a couple of questions for the audience. “Do you approve of a mainstream liberal media that covers for the mistakes of this president?\" “No,” they shouted. “Do you approve of a mainstream liberal media that won’t cover Fast and Furious?” He said, referring to the Obama-era gun-running investigation. “No,” they yelled.“And do you approve of a liberal media that distorts and lies about the record of Ronald Reagan?” “No,” they shot back. “Well, I’m as frustrated as you, but you know what? I have a solution. Yes, there is a solution. It’s One America. This is going to be your network.” A few months later, on July 4, OAN flickered to life. From the beginning, the network aimed to become the C-SPAN of cable newsers: No talking heads, aside from a few opinion shows, and news delivered 21-hours a day from a studio. And from 2013 to Trump’s presidential campaign, the network largely toiled in obscurity. When Pocock arrived in 2015, just before the Republican primaries, he was happy to land a job at one of San Diego’s two TV news stations (the area is also home to KUSI, an independent station owned by McKinnon Broadcasting). Back then, he didn’t get the impression OAN was conservative from the job posting or his interview. “The coverage then was much more down the middle and left mostly to producers,” Pocock told me. “And as far as I can remember, there were no rules yet dictating coverage and what stories to avoid. Writers and producers were generally enthusiastic because it really was a great opportunity for people right out of college.”Over time, Pocock said, founder and owner Robert Herring became more involved in the newscast. As Trump ran for president, the network became known for covering his rallies and quashing negative stories about the then-candidate. When Mitt Romney gave a blistering March 2016 speech about Trump, for example, Herring told his journalists: “Do not carry the Romney speech live,” according to a 2017 report from the Washington Post. “OAN’s focus, namely providing a credible source of national and international news, hasn’t changed since its launch on July 4, 2013,” Charles Herring told me in an email. In August 2015, when Trump said Fox News debate moderator Megyn Kelly “had blood coming out of her eyes” and “blood coming out of her wherever” after she questioned him, Pocock said Robert Herring assigned him the story. “Mr. H got mad that I said Trump ‘attacked Megyn Kelly,’ suggesting that was an unfair representation because ‘she had gone after him during that debate’ and therefore wasn’t a victim,” Pocock recalled.Pocock told me other dictates soon popped up. “We were told through our executive producer to avoid stories slamming Russia (because H’s wife was from Russia, not [because of] election interference), stories about unarmed black people being killed by police, and negative stories about Trump or Tesla—because Mr. H. owned stock and several Tesla cars, and was worried that negative press from OAN would bring down its value,” Pocock said. A current anchor also recalled hearing the network was not to cover Tesla negatively because Herring owned stock and a Tesla, which Herring drives to work. Another current OAN employee didn’t know whether Herring owned Tesla stock, but also learned during training that “Tesla is on our list of ‘pro’ coverage topics.”Morale at the station began to sink, Pocock remembers. Those who stayed became close. “There was a sense that we were in the trenches together, trying to make conservative-leaning though factual news coverage,” he said. “Most employees thought the idea behind OAN was great—constantly refreshing programming purely focused on the news of the day, something like a Twitter news feed on your TV, during a time that CNN, FOX and MSNBC were pivoting to roundtables and talking heads—but that it was horribly mismanaged.” For example, Pocock said the network required three sources to support a story, but that rule became inconsistently applied. “Conservative stories would pass muster with two sources, while much higher standards would be applied to left-leaning ones,” Pocock recalls. Pocock said he was once reprimanded by Herring after suggesting InfoWars, a radio show and website widely recognized as peddling false conspiracy theories, wasn’t an accurate source. He said he was told to keep his “liberal beliefs at the door.” When he returned from the meeting with Herring, co-workers were surprised to see him: They told him they thought he would be fired. The four employees I spoke to who are currently at OAN say that unlike Pocock, they knew they were joining a network with a reputation for being Trumpian when they were hired. For the three anchors, working for OAN was a way to skip the traditional broadcast journalism path of toiling away for a local affiliate for years before getting a national audience. “It’s a little bit harder to break into those markets since they’re a little bit more established, and they have their own affiliates throughout the country,” said Alex Salvi, who hosts the 10 p.m. slot “After Hours with Alex Salvi.” “So I saw an opportunity there that I thought I should capitalize on.” In part, the ideological bent of the San Diego newsroom is due to age and political geography. “Because the headquarters is in San Diego, all the employees tend to be a lot more progressive,” said Salvi, who added that the newsroom skews quite young. Salvi, a 28-year-old with a law degree from Valparaiso University Law School and a graduate journalism degree from the University of Southern California, occupies a role as OAN’s Brian Stelter, covering the nexus of politics and media. “There are your hardcore conservatives, but it’s safe to assume that the majority of us are all pretty liberal.” Salvi confided in me that while at Valparaiso, he crafted several blogs as the editor-in-chief of the school’s law blog that were critical of then-Indiana Gov. Mike Pence’s response to the Scott County HIV outbreak. He interned for Democratic Illinois Rep. Mike Quigley in Chicago. On a recent weekend off, he returned to Chicago to follow the protests there, though didn’t use his reporting on the network. And Salvi’s on-air coverage isn’t exclusively focused on toeing the party line and minimizing the novel coronavirus. He has debated Liz Wheeler, the conservative millennial firebrand who helms “Tipping Point” during the 9 p.m. hour, about the effectiveness of lockdown measures (he argued social distancing has been effective) and their differing coronavirus coverage. Salvi also has criticized Sean Hannity’s coronavirus coverage.Salvi has a liberal background, but he doesn’t criticize OAN, which is perhaps why the network has fashioned Salvi into something of a spokesperson, an emissary to traditional media organizations such as CNN, where he has appeared on Stelter’s “Reliable Sources” to defend the channel. When I asked the network to interview an OAN personality for this story, it was Salvi who gave me a call. Rion’s obsequious questioning at the White House? “She is speaking about a lot of the questions that we’ve heard that a lot of our viewers want to hear covered,” Salvi told me, though he conceded he would word some of her questions in the briefing room differently. When I asked him whether he felt concerned about his career prospects after OAN—if others in the broader journalism community might peg him as talent on the president’s favorite network—he demurred. “One American News has never had a sit-down interview with President Trump, the same way that CNN has never had a sit-down interview with President Trump, and that’s not something that I think a lot of people would suspect to hear when they hear about ‘the President’s favorite network,’” he said. “They think that we constantly have access to them and are sitting down with them all the time and having in-depth interviews but I don’t think that’s the case. … President Trump is giving credit to us for our coverage, but I think then that this is used to not only weaponize against him, but also weaponized against us.”When I asked network president Charles Herring about the network’s relationship with the president—Herring contacted me directly after I filled out the site’s “contact us” form—he told me that Trump has been watching the network since before his 2015 presidential bid. They met in early 2015, when Trump told Herring he was a fan of the network. Trump watched OAN in his New York residence, Herring said, through his Verizon FiOS TV bundle.As for the coverage that seemed to favor Republican bookings, Herring wrote in an email that “OAN interviews and features leading Democrat newsmakers on a regular basis. OAN would like to interview presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden.” (He cited no examples of recent Democrats interviewed.)Watching OAN, it’s easy to see the symbiotic relationship between the president and the network. The network earns Trump’s attention with its doting coverage. When Trump gives it to OAN—in a tweet that returns the favor, for example—it is often in the context of goading Fox to follow suit. “I think that the president does use us a little bit as a leverage against Fox News at times where he’s not happy with their coverage,” Salvi said. Robert Herring seems to embrace this competitive dynamic. “Mr. President, why are you still watching Fox News?” Herring tweeted this week. He also teased a poll “in favor” of the president (conducted by OAN) on Twitter, after news broke that Trump issued a cease-and-desist letter to CNN for its polling that found Trump underwater. But in that promised report, Rouz omitted the poll’s findings that were bad for the president, according to the Washington Post, and the network eventually scrubbed it from its website. “The president supports it because it blindly promotes him,” one former OAN producer said, “and it blindly supports the president because that’s what makes it money and gives it unique viewership.” The three other current OAN employees I spoke to, all of whom declined to be named, were much less sanguine than Salvi. They have always known a portion of the network’s journalism was overwhelmingly pro-Trump, but soldiered on, swapping gripes over drinks at the bar. During Covid and nationwide protests, though, that frustration has given way to group texts about their growing problems with the network’s coverage, which they believe has become more conspiracy-laden and lopsided. It doesn’t help that mainstream outlets have been covering every misstep.“Once [our coronavirus coverage] started getting criticized by CNN and other outlets,” one anchor said “we all kind of just started to feel down about working here because it made us feel like all the work we were personally doing didn’t matter because all the attention on that started to drown out everything else.” This anchor was referring to Rouz’s now-deleted May 7 segment in which the coronavirus was depicted as a population control effort by China and George Soros. OAN pulled the segment after CNN and other outlets panned it.Then came George Floyd’s death, and the riots and protests that followed. The memo on how to cover the unrest was unusually heavy-handed, the anchor told me. “We do sometimes get certain emails about certain stories we don’t want to cover, but they’re never really about pushing out a certain narrative—this was the first one in that regard,” this person said. “We could obviously be more critical of the administration’s handling of (the protests and coronavirus) and it’s not so much that we’re praising his approach, we’re just leaving that aspect alone a little bit,” another anchor told me.Another said journalists there live in fear of getting a story pulled or reprimanded by “Mr. H.” “We could be doing more, but our producers are working with what they have and are allowed to do. … We can’t push too far without fearing our boss will tell us to pull a story.” The employees told me they shake their heads at what they consider the network’s out-of-touch and hagiographic segments. On the 12th day of protests, OAN aired a special 30-minute “investigative” report called “Trump: A History of Equality, Diversity and Inclusion,” hosted by Richard Pollock and a group called Black Millennials Supporting Trump. The report featured Trump’s work on criminal justice reform and a segment about how he gave singer/actress Jennifer Hudson an apartment in Trump International Hotel Chicago when members of her family were murdered in 2008; it pointed out that Trump once helped Jesse Jackson secure office space for his Rainbow/PUSH Coalition. Not mentioned is the fact that 74 percent of nonwhite voters disapprove of the president. Nor was Trump’s record on demanding to see the first black president’s birth certificate or his refusal to apologize to the Central Park Five, who were exonerated of assaulting a jogger in 1989. “Leave it to OAN,” an anchor texted me after learning of the documentary.As much as Robert Herring appears to police OAN’s coverage, though, one anchor said he also takes advantage of the presence of liberals at his network to some degree. “We do kind of secretly have a fear of being retaliated against for being liberal, but Mr. H typically [and in private] uses the argument that having liberal employees means that the news isn’t biased—despite the fact we’re not supposed to really run anything pro-liberal/Democrat,” the anchor said. Soon, however, Herring may see an exodus of the kind of reporters that give him plausible deniability—and that keep his network moving. Two anchors told me employees were dusting off their broadcast reels and polishing their cover letters. During a pandemic, others don’t see an exit strategy. “For most of us, we are choosing between our journalistic integrity and whether or not we pay the rent,” says a current OAN employee. “Ultimately, the guy who signs your paycheck calls the shots.”",
    "The chasm between how conservatives and progressives view the protester-occupied area shows how far apart the two sides have drifted — often at Trump's prodding.In less than two weeks, six blocks in Seattle have come to reflect the divisive American political landscape. President Donald Trump has tweeted angrily about the “Domestic Terrorists” and “Radical Left Democrats” occupying Seattle’s so-called Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone, or CHAZ — an area protesters have taken over after police withdrew on June 7. Fox News has portrayed it as a “city under siege” by antifa forces, even offering misleading evidence, such as digitally altered photos. These descriptors have spurred members of far-right groups such as the Proud Boys and Patriot Prayer to descend, claiming they are attempting to root out alleged antifa agents and insurrectionists that don’t actually appear to have much of a presence in the largely peaceful area. Meanwhile, progressives have highlighted elements of the area that much more accurately reflect the on-the-ground activities, discussing the hippie block party vibe and talking about how local activists are offering everything from free snacks and clothing to teach-ins on Marxism and harm reduction clinics.The massive chasm between the two viewpoints shows just how far apart conservatives and liberals have drifted during the Trump era. And Trump — backed by an array of conservative outlets, pundits and far-right groups — has frequently stoked those divisions with fire-and-brimstone rhetoric. The result is two sides that are increasingly retreating to their respective sides.“What I see is that the left is pretty much setting up a parallel country, a parallel system of law and order and parallel media,” said Neil McCabe, a national political reporter for The Tennessee Star and a former correspondent for the pro-Trump One America News Network. As a movement conservative, he added, he had given up on trying to find common ground with progressives, blaming them for leaving the right behind and rejecting them. “We conservatives didn't realize how far the left had gone towards separating and divorcing us.”Autonomous zones are nothing new. The ideology behind CHAZ dates back to the autonomous Marxist movements of Italy in the 1960s, emerging every so often in Europe among radical leftist movements that attempt to create post-capitalist communes. These efforts historically have ended quickly after negotiations with political leaders, according to Alexander Reid Ross, an instructor at Portland State University and the author of “Against the Fascist Creep.” But CHAZ emerged in an altogether different environment, an outgrowth of the recent wave of Black Lives Matter protests in the wake of a black Minneapolis man’s killing at the hands of a police officer. After nearly two weeks of clashes between Seattle law enforcement and protesters — which, at times, included tactics such as tear gas and pepper balls — the police department deployed a drastic de-escalation tactic: They removed officers from the scene and retreated to a perimeter around the zone. With no police officers, CHAZ was established. Over the weekend, Black Lives Matter activists renamed the area Capitol Hill Organized Protest, arguing that the area was not actually aspiring to autonomy or secession. But by then, the demands of the CHAZ had ballooned far beyond addressing systemic racism in policing: In an open letter published on June 10, the activists listed several reforms they hoped the city would undertake, including degentrification initiatives, free college programs and investment in community mental health services.Conservative reaction to Seattle’s autonomous zone has a particularly Trump-era undertone to it, Ross said. Rather than letting local and state officials deal with the protesters, Trump “doubled down on vilifying a group that had nothing to do with the organization of the protests — not just dog whistling, but calling out his protesters or Second Amendment people to basically get out into the streets and get into the vigilante mode.”The broad support for the racial justice protests indicates the issue will not recede anytime soon, putting pressure on lawmakers of both parties to enact police reform. But while Trump has made some concessions to the movement’s demands, signing an executive order on Tuesday offering incentives for police departments to adopt some reforms, activists say his offerings have fallen woefully short of what is needed. Trump has also found political utility in ranting about certain proposals from Black Lives Matter activists, including defunding or abolishing the police, and constantly reiterating his ever-present claim that antifa terrorists are floating among the protesters. And though CHAZ itself has not been a base camp for a leftist insurrection, its existence is based on rejecting existing governing and policing structures. Trump has reacted to that with calls for “LAW & ORDER.”“They've already walked away from the founding consensus,” McCabe said. “They're already at the point where they can have an autonomous Seattle zone.” The MAGA sphere has also latched onto the fact that visibly armed members of progressive gun groups are patrolling CHAZ, confirming their belief that the zone is, purposefully or not, incepting an anti-government plot. Far-right groups, Ross said, have used the presence of armed individuals as a pretext to travel to the area under the auspices of protecting civil society, not to protest against CHAZ. “The whole working purpose of the militia in the far right, is they kind of form this sort of porous membrane through which people travel in and out of the extreme right based on whether or not they're open racists,” he noted. “If you're going somewhere to stop the looting and to protect protesters from antifa outsiders, then you've got a narrative. You've got something clear that you can explain to people that doesn't make you sound like you're just there because you hate anti-racists.” Ultimately, CHAZ may amount to a weekslong encampment in the middle of Seattle, maintained by rather enthusiastic activists, that eventually fades.“To the extent they've avoided violence, that's admirable. But even just trying to take it over is silly,” said Scott Walter, president of the conservative-libertarian think tank Capital Research Center, pointing out that the zone still relied on city services such as trash pickup. As of Tuesday night, however, Trump seems determined to keep the CHAZ in the public eye, portraying local leaders there as cowed by potential antifa agents. “Does anyone notice how little the Radical Left takeover of Seattle is being discussed in the Fake News Media,” he tweeted. “That is very much on purpose because they know how badly this weakness & ineptitude play politically. The Mayor & Governor should be ashamed of themselves. Easily fixed!” Ironically, far-right groups and their allies targeting CHAZ might simply encourage the protest leaders to buckle down in response. Ross said one example he could think of when a somewhat-autonomous zone lasted for years is Exarcheia, an anarchist-friendly neighborhood in the middle of Athens, Greece, that for years has housed refugees for free. Greece’s collective memory of their decades of living under military dictatorship allowed the neighborhood to retain those characteristics for years, Ross said, even though the government has cracked down more recently. “People there are actually in support of [Exarcheia], because they don't want to see fascism in Greece,” he said.",
    "The House Judiciary Committee became tangled in bitter squabbles that had little to do with law enforcement reform.The House Judiciary Committee late Wednesday approved a major police reform bill on a party-line vote, the first step by Congress to address a crisis that has roiled the country since George Floyd died in police custody on May 25.Yet for much of the day, the panel was ensnared in acrimonious cultural and political quarrels that had little to do with the underlying issue of police brutality, which the legislation is supposed to address.Lawmakers fought over “Black Lives Matter” versus “All Lives Matter”; whether antifa is a terrorist group that should be investigated by the FBI or if the far-right boogaloo movement is a greater threat; whether Congress should require the FBI and other federal law enforcement agencies to tape their interviews with suspects, citing the Michael Flynn and Paul Manafort cases as prime reasons for doing so; and if the so-called Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone in Seattle is a mortal danger to the rest of republic.Sometime around dinnertime, the two sides fought for 40 minutes over the security of the southern border.But the most incendiary exchange took place between the normally low-key Rep. Cedric Richmond (D-La.) and Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), an acolyte of President Donald Trump who specializes in throwing rhetorical bombs at Democrats.The spat took place as Rep. Guy Reschenthaler (R-Pa.) offered an amendment to order federal agencies to consider whether antifa, the militant anti-fascist movement, is a terrorist organization. Judiciary Committee Chairman Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) dismissed the proposal as “arrant nonsense” — itself an extraordinary comment by a chair in the middle of a markup — while Rep. Hank Johnson (D-Ga.) claimed that antifa was a “figment of Donald Trump’s imagination.”Richmond, for his part, had clearly had enough of what he believed was Republican stalling. Richmond — an African American lawmaker who is the House Democratic liaison to Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee — lashed out at Republicans for trying to distract from the underlying issue of police violence.“To my colleagues, especially the ones that keep introducing amendments that are a tangent and a distraction from what we are talking about, you all are white males, you never lived in my shoes and you do not know what it’s like to be an African American male,” Richmond declared. All the Republicans on the Judiciary Committee are white.Gaetz interrupted Richmond to ask whether he was “certain that none of us have nonwhite children, because you reflected on your black son and you said none of us could understand.”But Richmond cut off Gaetz: “It is about black males, black people in the streets that are getting killed. And if one of them happens to be your kid, I’m concerned about him, too. And clearly I’m more concerned about him than you are.”That enraged Gaetz, who angrily declared: “You’re claiming you’re more concerned for my family than I do? Who in the hell do you think you are? You don’t know how much we care about our families. This is outrageous.”“Was that a nerve?” Richmond asked.“You’re damn right it was a nerve,” Gaetz responded.The exchange was one of several heated moments in the daylong session. The Judiciary Committee, just six months removed from impeaching the president, includes some of Congress’ most ardent Trump critics and defenders, and the hangover from that battle still reverberates.There were numerous detours from the issue of police brutality, as Republicans brought up topics such as Big Tech censorship, anti-abortion rights and “lawlessness” in Seattle’s protest zone.The \"Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone,\" in fact, was a recurring theme throughout the proceedings. Rep. Debbie Lesko (R-Ariz.) at one point offered an amendment to cut off federal police grants to any municipality that allows an autonomous zone to be created within its borders.Rep. Pramilya Jayapal (D-Wash.), whose district is home to the Seattle zone, was upset by Republicans’ repeated attempts to raise the issue. She blamed Fox News and “right-wing media pundits” for what she said was “misinformation” being spread about her hometown.“I don’t know how to keep telling people that what they’re saying are lies,” Jayapal said, growing exasperated as she again slapped down Republican accusations of a “law-enforcement-free micro-state” in her district. “Please stop this nonsense and let’s get back to the bill that's at hand.”Multiple Democrats, meanwhile, repeatedly used their time to call out Republicans in the hearing room who occasionally took off their masks — in violation of a guidance circulated by Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Monday. Under the new coronavirus guidance, Pelosi permitted chairmen to instruct the sergeant-at-arms to bar anyone who refuses to cover their face from a hearing room.After several stern reminders, Nadler told Republicans he wouldn’t recognize anyone who is not wearing a mask. Despite the warning, Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), remained maskless for much of the hearing. Rep. Tom McClintock (R-Calif.) declared that he didn‘t wear a mask because he didn‘t think contracting coronavirus was any more a health threat than getting the flu, and he dared Nadler to cite a House rule that required masks to be worn. But McClintock did bow to Nadler‘s demands and put on a mask so he could be recognized to speak.Still, it was a historic day for the subject matter alone — a debate on systemic racism and police brutality consuming both chambers of Congress amid nationwide demonstrations.For many Democrats, the issue is intensely personal. Eight lawmakers on the panel are African American, including the chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, Rep. Karen Bass (D-Calif.), and the House Democratic Caucus chair, Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.). Many have been introducing bills for years to rein in police power.The Democratic roster also includes freshman Rep. Lucy McBath (D-Ga.), whose teenage son, who was black, was murdered by a white man over the volume of his music. McBath sat in the front row on Wednesday, just steps away from Gaetz.And it was those voices, other Democrats say, they intended to showcase.Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.), who is white, said his “first instinct” was to introduce his own legislation on policing reforms. But he said he was urged by black friends and staff to leave it up to the CBC.“I think Cedric [Richmond] said it best, speaking to Republicans: ‘You don’t know what it’s like to be in my shoes,’” Swalwell said in an interview. “I’m not in the shoes of my CBC colleagues. Their ideas are going to be more meaningful, so I’m just trying to listen to debate, rather than interject.”But the panel’s meeting on Wednesday also made history as the House’s first-ever virtual markup amid the global pandemic.The proceedings took place in a cavernous room in the basement of the U.S. Capitol, with members spread 6 feet apart, only a handful of staffers and even fewer reporters. Roughly a dozen members took part in the hearing via remote hookups from their districts.With each roll-call vote, the clerk looked not only to each member in the room, but also to a massive TV screen that showed the livestream video of members in California, Washington and Texas.The bill was ultimately approved with zero Republican amendments, sending it to the House floor for a vote on June 25 when it is expected to pass largely along party lines. It will then likely languish in the Senate, where Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has said the chamber will take up the GOP’s own version of policing reforms.In both bills, the biggest challenge is how to overhaul decades of systemic racism in police departments without causing permanent rifts between officers and the communities they serve.“They’re being hunted down like they’re the enemy of society. Yes, we want to protect black lives, and all lives, including those who put theirs on the line,” Rep. Mike Johnson (R-La.) said, noting members of his own family who are in law enforcement.“I’m sorry, I get emotional about this, but it’s an emotional subject.”",
    "Under the Obama administration, the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division conducted numerous probes into police departments.The Justice Department has not ruled out conducting a large-scale investigation into the Minneapolis Police Department for violating its community’s civil rights, according to a letter a top official there sent to a senator. After a white Minneapolis police officer killed a black man, George Floyd, by pinning Floyd by the neck with his knee for almost nine minutes, Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) called on the Justice Department to open a systematic investigation into the city’s police department. Such probes are called pattern or practice investigations. Under the Obama administration, the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division conducted numerous probes into police departments, including Baltimore; Ferguson, Mo.; and Chicago. But under the Trump administration, DOJ officials have abandoned conducting such investigations of troubled police departments. And former Attorney General Jeff Sessions — in one of his last moves before Trump fired him in November 2018 — signed a memo that critics said defanged the probes. After completing a pattern or practice investigation, the Justice Department enters talks with the police department and usually negotiates a court order mandating reforms. Civil rights activists argue the court orders are powerful tools for forcing departments to make changes. But many Republicans argue they can be too burdensome for departments and can damage officer morale. In a letter responding to Klobuchar, the DOJ’s head of legislative affairs indicated the department is considering launching such a probe into the Minneapolis Police Department. The letter noted that DOJ has the authority to investigate “systemic violations of the Constitution” or of the law by police forces.“Where an investigation reveals a pattern or practice of such misconduct, the Section may initiate a civil action in the name of the United States against state or local officials and seek appropriate injunctive relief,” wrote Stephen Boyd, DOJ’s legislative affairs chief. “We will carefully consider the evidence in this case, as well as any additional information that comes to our attention, regarding your request for a civil pattern or practice investigation.” The letter did not earn any adulation from Klobuchar. “It’s been 23 days since George Floyd’s murder at the hands of the Minneapolis Police Department (MPD), and yet the DOJ has still not committed to investigate the patterns and practices of racially discriminatory policing at the MPD,” she said in a statement to POLITICO. “Any insinuation that there is not enough evidence to justify an immediate pattern and practice investigation is willfully ignoring the facts.”And the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, recently joined more than 200 groups to call on Barr to open a pattern or practice investigation of the Minneapolis Police Department. Vanita Gupta, the Leadership Conference’s president and CEO and the head of DOJ’s Civil Rights Division during the Obama administration, said there is ample evidence now to open such a probe. “It is imperative for the Department of Justice to open a pattern or practice investigation into the Minneapolis police department,” she said in a statement to POLITICO. “Both Attorneys General Sessions and Barr abdicated their responsibilities in this area and failed to use this key, strategic tool to address systemic constitutional violations by law enforcement agencies.”The DOJ, meanwhile, remains noncommittal — but hasn’t ruled out such a move. Asked about whether the Justice Department should launch a pattern and practice probe into the Minneapolis police department during a June 7 interview with CBS News, Barr said he didn’t see it as “warranted,” citing investigations underway by the state of Minnesota.Somewhat ambiguously, however, he added: “We still have to look into what kinds of use of force policies are used in that department, what the training has been and things like that. That’s not something we can do overnight.”It’s not clear whether Barr was referring to DOJ specifically conducting such an inquiry, or the justice system more generally.“The department considers a number of factors in determining the appropriate remedy to resolve a pattern or practice of constitutional violations by a law enforcement agency,” a DOJ official told POLITICO. “It is the mission of the Justice Department to ‘ensure public safety,’ and we will continue to encourage the proven, constitutional and proactive policing required to keep American neighborhoods safe from violent crime.”",
    "The U.S. pulled out of the U.N. Human Rights Council in 2018, did not participate in dramatic debate on racism within the country.The family of George Floyd made a dramatic appeal to the United Nations today for the world to hold the United States accountable for police brutality and systemic racism.Philonise Floyd, George Floyd’s brother, addressed a special meeting of the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva, Switzerland via video address, telling the assembled diplomats “my brother tortured and murdered on camera is the way black people are treated by police in America.” “I am my brother’s keeper” Floyd continued. “You in the United Nations are our brothers’ and sisters’ keepers. I am asking you to help me get justice.” The special session was held after 54 African countries called for a discussion on the “current racially inspired human rights violations, systematic racism, police brutality against people of African descent and violence against peaceful protests” in the United States. The two-day debate will continue tomorrow at 9 a.m. ET, after which the Council’s 47 members will vote on whether to establish an independent inquiry into U.S. racism and police brutality.Dozens of speakers lashed out at the U.S. — the world’s most powerful country and the biggest financial contributor to the United Nations, overall — in a highly unusual diplomatic scene, chaired by Council President Elisabeth Tichy-Fisslberger of Austria.At times the discussion turned into a platform for America’s foes, including Iran, which described George Floyd’s killing as a “public execution” at odds with Martin Luther King Jr.’s vision for a peaceful American society, and Cuba, which called severe racism “not the exception” but “part and parcel” of American life.The debate was the realization of an effort begun by civil rights activist Malcolm X in 1964, when he urged African states to call out the U.S. over racism and government discrimination and brutality. Fifty-six years later, many of the same problems exist in the U.S. What’s changed is that African nations are now more established and organized at the United Nations, with more political capital to spend highlighting problems outside their own borders.Speaking for the African Union group of 54 countries, the Central African Republic representative described George Floyd’s killing as “utterly unjustified,” while Somalia sought to put the issue in the context of other global challenges, calling racism “more dangerous than Covid-19.”South Africa’s Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka — the executive director of UN Women — recalled her involvement in South Africa’s anti-Apartheid movement, and urged a similar international outcry at the situation in the United States.The U.S. had no opportunity to respond. The Trump administration pulled the country out of the U.N. body in 2018, citing the prominent role played at the forum by notable human rights violators including Syria, Sudan and Saudi Arabia, and what Nikki Haley, then U.S. Ambassador to the U.N., described as the body’s “unending hostility towards Israel.” U.S. criticism of the Council dates back to its formation in 2006 when George W. Bush's Republican administration declined to take up a seat — a position reversed in 2009 by Democratic President Barack Obama.Ambassador Andrew Bremberg, who heads the U.S. mission in Geneva, said in a statement that the U.S. \"recognizes and is committed to addressing its shortcomings including racial discrimination.\" Bremberg added that \"any (U.N.) resolution on this topic that calls out countries by name should be inclusive\" of other countries with deep problems. Many of the speakers at today’s session, particularly U.S. allies, sought to emphasize that racism is not just an American problem but a global one. “None of our countries is immune” said Karin Bolin, Sweden’s representative.Croatia spoke on behalf of 27 EU countries and a group of smaller European countries saying: “We need to look into our own souls” and “put an end to such hate crimes” and “remain vigilant against the excessive use of force,” Croatia said.Speaking just before voting closed in the election for temporary members to the U.N. Security Council, Canada, one of the candidate countries, spoke about its own racism problem, rather than the situation in the U.S. Canada’s representative said that “systemic racism” continues to be the reality of black Canadians, indigenous Canadians and other groups. “There are no easy fixes: it will require sustained commitment from all quarters of society”Azerbaijan, on behalf of the 125 countries in the Non-Aligned Movement, complained about the increased use of “mass media” in disseminating hate speech, but was careful to emphasize that racism is a problem “in all spheres of life and in all parts of the world.”— Nahal Toosi contributed reporting",
    "The candidate, Marjorie Taylor Greene, finished first in last week’s primary for an open, safe GOP seat in Georgia but still faces an August runoff.The House’s highest-ranking Republicans are racing to distance themselves from a leading GOP congressional candidate in Georgia after POLITICO uncovered hours of Facebook videos in which she expresses racist, Islamophobic and anti-Semitic views.The candidate, Marjorie Taylor Greene, suggested that Muslims do not belong in government; thinks black people “are held slaves to the Democratic Party”; called George Soros, a Jewish Democratic megadonor, a Nazi; and said she would feel “proud” to see a Confederate monument if she were black because it symbolizes progress made since the Civil War.Greene finished first in a primary for a deep-red, northwest Georgia seat last week by a nearly 2-to-1 margin over the second-place candidate. She is entering an August runoff as the favorite to secure the Republican nomination for a district where that is tantamount to winning the general election in November. Her initial victory — which has sparked panic in GOP circles — comes as Republicans are grappling with a national reckoning over racial injustice and police brutality after George Floyd, an unarmed black man, was killed by a Minneapolis police officer last month. Republicans had just felt relief after they finally ousted Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa), a controversial member with a long history of making racist remarks, in a primary earlier this month. Now GOP lawmakers, aides and operatives fear Greene — a wealthy businesswoman who has already drawn national attention because of her belief in a trove of QAnon conspiracy theories — could create an even bigger black eye for the party if she wins the nomination. Greene will face neurosurgeon John Cowan in the Aug. 11 primary runoff.“These comments are appalling, and Leader McCarthy has no tolerance for them,” said Drew Florio, a spokesman for House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.).House Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) went further, throwing his weight behind Greene’s opponent.“The comments made by Ms. Greene are disgusting and don’t reflect the values of equality and decency that make our country great,” Scalise said in a statement. “I will be supporting Dr. Cowan.”In recordings obtained by POLITICO, Greene described Islamic nations under Sharia law as places where men have sex with \"little boys, little girls, multiple women\" and \"marry their sisters\" and \"their cousins.\" She suggested the 2018 midterms — which ushered in the most diverse class of House freshmen — was part of “an Islamic invasion of our government” and that “anyone that is a Muslim that believes in Sharia law does not belong in our government.” In other videos, she directly compared Black Lives Matter activists to the neo-Nazis and Ku Klux Klan members who marched at a white nationalist rally three years ago in Charlottesville, Va., denouncing them all as “idiots.” And Greene forcefully rejected the notion there are racial disparities in the U.S. or that skin color affects the “quality” of one's life: “Guess what? Slavery is over,” she said. “Black people have equal rights.” When asked for comment on quotes from the videos, Greene campaign manager Isaiah Wartman did not deny their veracity but declined to elaborate.“Thank[s] for the reminder about Soros. We forgot to put him in our newest ad. We’re fixing that now,” he wrote in an email to POLITICO. “Would you like me to send you a copy?”Sitting cross-legged on the floor and sporting an American flag baseball cap, Greene said in one video that unemployment — which affects people of color at disproportionately higher rates — is simply the product of “bad choices” and being “lazy.” Minorities, Greene added, are being held back in society by gangs, drugs, a lack of education, Planned Parenthood and abortions — “not white people.” “I know a ton of white people that are as lazy and sorry and probably worse than black people,” she said. “And that has everything to do with their bad choices and their personal responsibility. That is not a skin-color issue.”Greene later implied that black women have it easier because of affirmative action, complaining they are more likely to get into a college than a white male if they have the same GPA.“The most mistreated group of people in the United States today are white males,” Greene said as she wrapped up one of the videos.The recordings, in which Greene spends hours ranting to her social media followers, were taped direct-to-camera. The date of the videos is not clear, but they appear to have been recorded between late 2017 and early 2019. She initially launched a campaign in June of last year for Democratic Rep. Lucy McBath’s seat in Atlanta's northern suburbs, but switched to the staunchly conservative 14th District when Rep. Tom Graves (R-Ga.) announced his plans to retire.The top three House GOP leaders, as well as the head of the party’s campaign arm, denounced Greene’s rhetoric upon learning from POLITICO of her derogatory comments about blacks, Muslims and Jews.While the National Republican Congressional Committee does not get involved in primaries, NRCC spokesman Chris Pack said Chairman Tom Emmer (R-Minn.) is “personally disgusted by this rhetoric and condemns it in the strongest possible terms.” And a spokesman for House Republican Conference Chairwoman Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) — who forcefully rebuked King and called on him to step down — said, “obviously, Rep. Cheney opposes these offensive and bigoted comments.”McCarthy already pulled his support for another controversial GOP candidate in California, Ted Howze, after POLITICO uncovered dozens of social media posts that demeaned Muslims and immigrants.Despite Greene’s penchant for controversy — she has already faced public criticism for taking a photo with a white supremacist, floating a conspiracy theory that the Las Vegas shooting massacre was a plot to abolish the Second Amendment and calling one of the student activists from Parkland high school “little Hitler”— Greene has earned some congressional support.She nabbed endorsements from Rep. Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.), the chairman of the conservative House Freedom Caucus; Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), one of President Donald Trump’s closest allies on Capitol Hill; Rep. Jody Hice (R-Ga.), a Freedom Caucus member and former pastor who rescinded his endorsement the day after this story was published; and the House Freedom Fund, the political arm for the Freedom Caucus. Jordan said he disagreed with her statements but did not pull his endorsement. Biggs did not respond to a request for comment for this story.There is now a growing effort in the GOP to rally around Greene’s opponent. Georgia Reps. Buddy Carter and Drew Ferguson both backed Cowan on Wednesday morning, as did Rep. Austin Scott. Ferguson called her comments “abhorrent” and said in a statement that she “shouldn’t have a place in Congress.”Scott echoed a similar sentiment, saying “her statements would render her incapable of being an effective member of Congress.”“This isn’t something that happened 10 years ago, when she said something out of context,” Scott said in an interview.House Democrats have also pounced on Greene, even before the publication of the videos. Rep. Cheri Bustos of Illinois, the chair of the House Democratic campaign arm, called her a “next-generation Steve King” in a statement.And Greene’s opponent, Cowan, is making a similar argument ahead of the runoff.\"These comments do not reflect the views of the people of the 14th District,\" he said in an interview. \"I think she would embarrass our state, and I’m going to do everything I can to keep her from representing northwest Georgia in Congress.\"In one of the videos, Greene offered a full-throated defense of Confederate statues, saying that if she were a black person she would be “proud” to see a Confederate monument \"because I’d say, ‘Look how far I have come in this country.’” Her comments are surfacing amid a heated national debate over whether Confederate statues should be removed and whether military bases named after Confederate leaders should be renamed — a debate that is also unfolding in Congress.Greene blamed the country’s racial wounds on “identity politics” and President Barack Obama, who, she said, won black voters only because of “the color of his skin.” She also suggested that’s why Obama identifies as black, even though he is “half-white” and “American,” Greene noted.And during another offensive diatribe, Greene accused Democrats of “trying to keep the black people in a modern-day form of slavery” and said black Republicans get called “coon” and “Uncle Toms” by liberal black voters.“It’s a slavery system to keep their vote,” she said.In her videos, Greene is particularly preoccupied with the increase in Muslim members of Congress. She referred to freshman Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) as \"that woman out of Minnesota\" who \"has got to wear a head covering.\" She said members should not be able to take the oath of office on a Koran: \"No! You have to be sworn in on the Bible.\"In 2018, Omar and freshman Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) became the first two Muslim women elected to Congress. They have become top targets of the right, along with freshman Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts, who are also women of color.\"There is an Islamic invasion into our government offices right now,” Greene said. “You saw after midterm elections what we saw so many Muslims elected. I don’t know the exact number but there were quite a few.”She said Muslims “are not being held back in any way” because the Constitution guarantees equality. “But what you people want,” she said, “is special treatment. You want to rise above us, and that’s what we’re against.”And in another rant, she urged adherents of Sharia to stay in their own countries and leave the U.S. alone. \"If you want Islam and Sharia law, you stay over there in the Middle East,\" she said. \"You stay there, and you go to Mecca and do all your thing. And, you know what, you can have a whole bunch of wives, or goats, or sheep, or whatever you want. You stay over there. But in America, see, we’ve made it this great, great country. We don’t want it messed up.\"She also spends several minutes attacking Imtiaz Ahmad Mohammad, a candidatefor the Florida state House, because he is Muslim and an immigrant. \"So let me tell you something. This man is not born in America. He’s from Pakistan. OK?,\" she said, warning he was the only candidate who had filed for the seat, and that “his last name is Mohammad.” She then attempted to recruit a challenger: \"Anyone that lives in that district, you better sign your butt up and run against this guy,” she said. “Because we cannot let him win.\"In a video and on social media, Greene has also touted an anti-Semitic conspiracy theory that Soros, a Holocaust survivor, collaborated with the Nazis. “George Soros says dark forces have been awakened by Trump’s win. I don’t think so,” she said in one video. “George Soros is the piece of crap that turned in — he’s a Jew — he turned in his own people over to the Nazis.”In February 2019, Greene replied to a tweet that included several memes accusing Soros of being part of a secret totalitarian world government. One picture showed Soros as a vampire who controls “every single Democrat politician.” In her reply, Greene called Soros “the Nazi himself trying to continue what was not finished.” The Republican Jewish Coalition was one of the first GOP groups to denounce her publicly after the primary.",
    "The full House will take up Democrats' sweeping reform bill next week. The House Judiciary Committee advanced a sweeping police reform bill late Wednesday following a day of emotional exchanges and pitched anger among lawmakers on the panel as they confronted questions about institutional racism and police brutality against black Americans.After nearly 12 hours of tense debate, the committee approved the bill along party lines with all Republicans voting in opposition. The Democrats’ plan, which will go to the House floor next week, would ban chokeholds and no-knock warrants, limit officers’ immunity from prosecution and establish a national database of police misconduct.Senior Democrats, led by Congressional Black Caucus Chair Karen Bass of California, quickly crafted the comprehensive reform bill in response to the nationwide unrest following the police killing of George Floyd, an unarmed black man, in Minneapolis on May 25. The GOP-controlled Senate will take up its own police reform bill next week but the proposal has already been widely panned by Democrats as \"toothless\" and \"a sham.\"Still, senior lawmakers in both parties continue to insist they can come to a compromise that will reach President Donald Trump's desk in the coming weeks. Both parties and the president feel pressure to act as protests continue for the third straight week — a nation unabating in its fury over the senseless killings of unarmed black Americans by police. Democrats on the Judiciary panel spent almost a dozen hours Wednesday sweeping aside a series of Republican amendments, including a proposal to require that police interviews with suspects be recorded, a proposal Democrats said they were open to at later stages of the process. But as the day wore on, Democrats increasingly sniped at Republicans over what they claimed were efforts to drag in extraneous issues that turned the focus away from questions of race. That dynamic turned heated when Rep. Cedric Richmond (D-La.), a former chairman of the CBC, accused the all-white Republican side of the dais of racial bias, \"unconscious\" or otherwise, and said they were making \"a mockery of the pain that exists in my community.\"Richmond's remarks, which included a reference to his son, prompted an exchange with Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), who questioned how Richmond could be certain none of the Republicans on the panel had black children. \"I already know there are people on the other side who have black grandchildren,\" Richmond replied. \"It is not about the color of your kids. It is about black males, black people in the streets that are getting killed. And if one of them happens to be your kid, I’m concerned about him too. And clearly I’m more concerned about him than you are.\"Gaetz shot back angrily, saying Richmond went over the line: \"You’re claiming you’re more concerned for my family than I do? Who in the hell do you think you are?\"The exchange encapsulated a day of raw emotion on Capitol Hill. To Democrats, speed is of the essence — not only because of the realities of the political calendar but because after decades of failed efforts to implement sweeping reform, the national landscape has shifted after Floyd's killing and created an opening for genuine action.Republicans on the committee, led by Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, emphasized that they wanted a more deliberative approach, citing measures offered by Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.) and an executive order signed by Trump earlier this week as thoughtful steps in the right direction. Those measures beef up police reporting requirements and encourage reforms — but don’t mandate them. Republicans also offered amendments to ask the FBI for a report on whether antifa is a domestic terrorist organization and to bar federal grants to a so-called autonomous zone in Seattle that Republicans have described as a lawless \"terrorist\" stronghold. Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), who sits on the panel fiercely pushed back on that claim, saying the area is a venue for peaceful protest. Other GOP amendments offered Wednesday would have struck the qualified immunity provision in the bill and would raise the maximum sentence for lynching crimes to the death penalty.\"Not one single Republican was consulted\" in the crafting of the bill, said Jordan, the top Republican on the panel. \"I hope today that you will embrace our thoughtful amendments that we plan to offer.\"But Democrats did not relent as the debate stretched late into the evening Wednesday, despite what was an inevitable result: the party-line advancement of the bill. The House will vote on the bill June 25, with enough Democrats already signed on as co-sponsors to guarantee its passage. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced Wednesday that the Senate will take up the GOP’s policing bill next week. But senior Democrats on the Judiciary panel were quick to dismiss to GOP bill, calling it a half-measure that doesn't match the needs of those protesting for reform.\"What Sen. Scott is offering is a sham,\" House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) told reporters. Bass, who also sits on the Judiciary Committee, panned the Republican bill, saying it \"mimics\" Democrats' proposal \"but without the teeth.\" And Speaker Nancy Pelosi called the GOP proposal \"window dressing\" and \"toothless\" in an interview on CNN Wednesday.Yet, unlike previous efforts at police reform, there appears to be room — however narrow — for bipartisan compromise. Members of the Judiciary Committee like Rep. Kelly Armstrong (R-N.D.), a former public defender, have engaged with Democrats to find areas of agreement on policies like police body cameras, qualified immunity and sentencing disparities.Armstrong said he's had productive discussions with committee Democrats including Richmond, David Cicilline of Rhode Island and Joe Neguse of Colorado, on potential bipartisan legislation. But he noted that the committee, historically an emblem of congressional partisanship and strained this Congress by impeachment, has \"a lot of trust problems.\"And that was apparent in the panel's first vote Wednesday — with Democrats voting down Armstrong's amendment to require federal law enforcement agencies to record all interviews with potential suspects. Democrats initially asked Armstrong to withdraw the amendment so they could work together on incorporating the idea into the final bill. But Armstrong refused as he and several other Republicans connected the proposal to the FBI’s 2017 interview with former national security adviser Michael Flynn, who Trump allies allege was railroaded by law enforcement. Democrats slammed Republicans' repeated efforts to reignite the Flynn debate, saying this hearing was about the countless unarmed black men and women who have lost their lives at the hands of police. \"We're not here to talk about Michael Flynn. That's beneath the dignity of this institution and the lives that have been lost,\" Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) said. Jeffries then gave powerful testimony about having to have \"that conversation\" with his teenage son before he participated in a Black Lives Matter protest in Brooklyn recently. \"Some may even look at you as a threat because of the color of your skin. ... Do not respond or react to any unjustified abuse against you,\" Jeffries recounted to the committee. \"Even if you're completely in the right, you're being harassed, you're being abused, you can't respond — because it may result in your life being taken.\" Caitlin Oprysko contributed to this report.

    "A rallying cry once on the margins is now driving the debate around the country as Americans reckon with a law enforcement regime increasingly seen as unjust and unredeemable. To many watching the historic protests against racism and police brutality unfold across the country, it was a call that came out of nowhere: Defund the Police.Yet hours after the first videos of George Floyd’s killing at the hands of a Minneapolis police officer went viral online, those three words became the rallying cry of a movement that had suddenly won America’s undivided attention.To critics — chief among them the president of the United States and his allies, as well as the elected Democrats who quickly distanced themselves from a slogan they deemed too radical to embrace — it was baffling. Was it meant to be taken literally? Seriously? Both? Neither? Were the protesters really calling for no police whatsoever?But the demands to abolish the police didn’t spring from nowhere — they have deep roots among a group of activists and academics who have been arguing for years that merely reforming a system they see as fundamentally broken is futile: To truly address the unfair way police departments treat Black and Latino communities, they say, you need to tear down the entire edifice and start over.The modern epicenter of the Defund the Police movement is Minneapolis, where a variety of groups motivated by past episodes of police brutality have been organizing for nearly a decade. One of them, the women and LGBTQ-led Black Visions Collective, penned one of the first petitions to defund their city’s police department on May 25, almost immediately after Floyd was killed. “TELL MINNEAPOLIS CITY COUNCIL TO DEFUND THE POLICE,” the headline on the petition read. Within a week, protests had sprung up in all 50 states, all defined by support of black lives and opposition to police violence. “We did a statewide and national call and that sparked uprisings in other places,” said Oluchi Omeoga, an organizer and core team member with the Black Visions Collective.As the calls to defund police departments echoed across the country, they forced elected officials to reckon with a movement that had suddenly broken into mainstream discussion. The breakthrough came after years of seeing activists’ impact diluted through incremental reform measures or wholesale ignoring of their demands.“It’s different than the 2013, 2012, 2017 iteration of the Black Lives Matter movement,” Omeoga said. “We’re no longer asking for convictions or folks to be indicted. We’re asking for an actual narrative shift, a seismic shift in the systems of police.”Since Floyd’s death, city councils in more than a dozen cities including Minneapolis, New York and Washington have proposed reductions in their police departments' annual budgets. Los Angeles’ mayor Eric Garcetti has embraced a more limited role for the city’s police department. Congress, too has proposed legislation that addresses police violence and aims to vote on the bill by the end of June. The words “DEFUND THE POLICE” now appear in giant yellow letters along 16th Street in Washington, D.C., mere blocks from the White House and made indelible on street-mapping software. But perhaps most notably, many Americans who might have never imagined communities without police officers no longer see it as an impossible feat, though most still oppose the idea. A new POLITICO/Morning Consult poll shows that nearly two-thirds of Americans support major reforms in policing, while close to one-third say they are in favor of defunding the police. “I think what we're seeing now,” said Kim Burke, a senior fellow at the Center for Policing Equity, “is a renewed call and an increased attention to these fundings as a product of the large-scale and incredibly rapid changes we saw the government take during the corona epidemic.”Burke said the recent stampede toward police reform had shown that “government can almost overnight change policy, allocate money differently, change city budgets differently in the name of public safety. And this is what black communities have been asking for years.”Even if the sudden discussion of defunding the police has been astonishingly swift, it’s an idea decades in the making. Scholars and activists on police and prison abolition have been pushing an invest-divest model that calls for lower police budgets, removal of officers from schools, demilitarization of police equipment and reallocation of police funds for schools, housing and public health. The Movement for Black Lives, a coalition of more than 50 black-led organizations under the purview of the Black Lives Matter movement, adopted this idea into its core organizing vision in 2016, marking a shift away from a platform that called for fair treatment under the law for black Americans to a focus on stripping police systems altogether.Andrea Ritchie, who has studied and engaged in movements to defund police as early as the 1991 Rodney King uprisings, said the call has been for “disinvestment not just financially but politically, ideologically and I think for many of us, emotionally.” “It’s not time for just budget cuts across the board. That’s not what ‘defund the police’ is calling for,” Ritchie said. “What ‘defund the police’ is calling for is saying, ‘we need to take money, power and equipment and scope of operation away from police and we need to invest that money and more into what people need to survive this pandemic and this economic crisis.’”America — plagued by economic turmoil and growing outrage at President Trump’s law-and-order approach to policing — provided a perfect backdrop for the movement to grow. This time, Omeoga argued, instead of repeating a pattern in which all the attention zeroed in a single focal point — such as Minneapolis or Louisville, or Ferguson, Mo., in 2014 — activists are encouraging change within their own communities.“Now we’re calling for folks not to come to Minneapolis but to see the similarities that are happening in all of these other places and to actually ask your local county, state legislature to make a change and also demand the defunding of their police departments,” Omeoga said.Organizers say their work now involves helping interested parties understand what a safe community looks like without a police presence. The idea has not fully taken hold in some circles, who say they support police reform but oppose defunding or abolishing police.Top Democrats who are leading the congressional response to police reform have maintained that they are not interested in defunding the police. South Carolina congressman Jim Clyburn, fully distanced himself from the idea on Sunday, calling instead for a “reimagining” of policing. Other figures have taken issue with the phrasing, saying it alienates those who might be on the fence about how to change police moving forward, while embracing the general concept of shifting resources and responsibilities to other parts of government.Black activist groups of all kinds are now seeking to capitalize on all the attention and rush of support for their platforms, while coalescing around a shared goal of aggressive police reform, if not outright defunding. Black organizations across the country have seen their membership numbers skyrocket and netted millions in donations.“I think that this is a great conversation for this country to be having, especially in the middle of a global pandemic,” said Alicia Garza, co-founder of Black Lives Matter. “Especially at the brink of a recession, where we've got, I believe, the latest figures of 40 percent black unemployment and facing a massive crisis in our democracy. I think these are absolutely the right questions that this country needs to be grappling with right now.”The biggest question that remains, Garza explained, is what the alternative to policing would be in the conversation about community safety. “You cannot police your way or jail your way, or frankly, kill your way out of crisis.\"",
    "Almost 60 percent of those polled think a significant overhaul of police departments is needed.Most voters believe police departments need to be seriously overhauled but don’t back the “Defund the Police” movement, according to a new POLITICO/Morning Consult poll conducted after weeks of protests against racial injustice and police brutality.In the poll, conducted Friday through Sunday, a combined 59 percent say police departments across the country need either a complete overhaul (22 percent) or major reforms (37 percent). Just over 1-in-4, 27 percent, say police departments need a minor overhaul, and only 5 percent think they don’t need any reforms at all.But that support does not extend to the slogan “Defund the Police,” which some activists say is about reforming law enforcement as much or more than actually making sizable budget cuts. By a nearly 2-to-1 margin, more voters oppose the movement to “Defund the Police” (57 percent) than support it (29 percent). More than 4-in-10, 43 percent, strongly oppose the movement.“While nearly 60 percent agree police departments are in need of major reforms, voters remain skeptical of the ‘Defund the Police’ movement,” said Kyle Dropp, co-founder and chief research officer at Morning Consult.The disparity suggests the mood of the electorate three weeks after the killing of George Floyd by police in Minneapolis puts both political parties on the defensive: Republicans, including President Donald Trump, are exploring reforms to policing — while Democrats, including presumptive presidential nominee Joe Biden, are keeping the activists calling for localities to “Defund the Police” at arm’s length.A large majority of Democratic voters, 82 percent, believe police departments need a complete overhaul or major reforms, compared with just 33 percent of Republicans. Among independents, 60 percent think departments need a complete overhaul or major reforms.Voters are divided on whether police departments receive too much funding (25 percent), the right amount of funding (26 percent) or not enough funding (28 percent). Only 18 percent of Democratic voters think police departments don’t receive enough funding, while just 8 percent of Republicans say the police get too much funding.As for the “Defund the Police” movement, it garners support from 48 percent of Democrats, 11 percent of Republicans and 26 percent of independents.Voters were evenly split on redirecting funding from law enforcement to community development programs. A split-sample experiment also found no significant difference in the results whether respondents were asked about redirecting funding in their local communities or in police departments across the country.Also in the poll, 72 percent of voters say things in the country are now on the wrong track, the highest “wrong track” number the poll has recorded in the Trump era.The poll shows 40 percent of voters approve of the job Trump is doing as president, essentially unchanged from 39 percent last week. A majority, 57 percent, disapprove of Trump’s job performance.The POLITICO/Morning Consult poll surveyed 1,987 registered voters and has a margin of error of plus or minus 2 percentage points.Morning Consult is a global data intelligence company, delivering insights on what people think in real time by surveying tens of thousands across the globe every single day.More details on the poll and its methodology can be found in these two documents: Toplines | Crosstabs",
    "The Senate bill comes as the country faces a reckoning over police brutality.The Senate will consider legislation next week to reform policing practices in the U.S., Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced on Wednesday.The decision comes amid a pressure campaign from lawmakers in both parties who are pushing for sweeping criminal-justice reforms in the aftermath of a string of police killings of unarmed African Americans and subsequent nationwide protests.The Senate will hold a procedural vote next week on Sen. Tim Scott’s bill, which was unveiled Wednesday by the South Carolina Republican and a group of GOP senators. But it’s unclear whether Democrats will join Republicans to meet the 60-vote threshold and begin floor debate on possible amendments. Democrats have panned Scott’s bill as a watered-down version of their own plan, which the House Judiciary Committee is expected to advance later Wednesday.“Our Democratic friends — if they want to make a law and not just try to make a point, I hope that they’ll join us in getting on the bill and trying to move forward in the way the Senate does move forward when it’s trying to actually get an outcome,” McConnell said.“We’re serious about making a law here,” he added. “It’s not about trying to create partisan differences. This is about coming together and getting an outcome.”McConnell’s announcement was a stark reversal from earlier in the week, when Senate Republican leaders posited that the chamber would not consider police reform until after the Independence Day recess. But public opinion has swung sharply in favor of reforms in recent weeks, putting additional pressure on GOP leaders.“I think this package speaks very clearly to the young person who’s concerned when he’s stopped by law enforcement officers — we see you,” said Scott, the lone African American GOP senator.It remains unclear whether Democrats will give Republicans the votes to open up a formal debate on Scott’s bill. Scott said he has had frequent conversations with Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), who co-authored the Democratic plan, but there are no active bipartisan negotiations, raising the prospect that next week’s procedural vote could fall along party lines.“I don't think the nation is going to allow us to lose the momentum,” an optimistic Scott told reporters.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) criticized the GOP proposal Wednesday, saying it fails to “rise to the moment.” Schumer noted that the GOP bill does not explicitly ban the use of chokeholds and “no-knock” warrants, unlike the Democratic proposal, and said it doesn’t include “real meaningful accountability for individual officers’ misconduct.”But Schumer didn’t close the door completely to negotiations and said he expects Senate Republicans to work with Democrats to make “significant improvement.”“This is not about letting the perfect be the enemy of the good. This is about replacing what’s ineffective with what’s effective, and we must have effective change,” he added, indicating that Democrats are not ruling out supporting a floor debate.Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) said Democrats “really need an understanding from Sen. McConnell” on whether it will be “a take it or leave it moment,” or if both sides intend to “sit down and legislate.”Scott’s bill requires additional disclosures about the use of force and codifies reporting requirements on the use of “no-knock” warrants, according to two sources and a copy of the bill text obtained by POLITICO on Tuesday night. It also provides incentives for chokehold bans.The bill, which was formally introduced Wednesday, comes as the country faces a reckoning over police brutality in the wake of the death of George Floyd at the hands of a Minneapolis police officer.The proposal has already drawn criticism from Democrats for not going far enough to reform police practices. The Democratic plan would ban chokeholds, limit qualified immunity for police officers and stop no-knock warrants in federal drug cases.The House is expected to vote as soon as next week on the Democratic bill. Members of both parties are hoping to get a bill to the president's desk before the July 4 recess, but so far there are few indications that Democrats and Republicans can strike an agreement.The GOP bill would create reporting requirements on the use of deadly force by officers and reduce federal funding for state and local police departments that fail to comply. In addition, the legislation requires state and local governments to submit reports on “no-knock” warrants to the Justice Department. It would also limit eligibility for funding if a law enforcement agency does not have a policy that prohibits the use of chokeholds “except when deadly force is authorized.”White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany said later Wednesday that President Donald Trump “is fully in support of the Scott bill” and “every element of it.”The measure also provides grants for the purchase of body cameras and the development of policies and procedures related to their use. In addition, it increases penalties for false police reports and creates a Commission on the Social Status of Black Men and Boys. That bipartisan measure would provide a report on conditions that affect African American men, such as education, health care and the criminal justice system. Another commission would review the criminal justice system entirely.The GOP bill also would make lynching a federal crime. While the House passed a widely backed anti-lynching bill in February, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) recently called for changes to the legislation to ensure that lynching charges don't extend to minor injuries. Paul’s objections resulted in a heated exchange on the Senate floor earlier this month with Booker and Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.).The bill includes another bipartisan proposal that would make it a crime for a federal law enforcement official to engage in a sexual act with an individual in his or her custody or “while acting under color of law.”Some advocates are optimistic, including Holly Harris, president and executive director of the Justice Action Network, who described Scott's bill as a \"baseline for negotiation.\" In a final compromise bill, Harris said she would like to see provisions that address demilitarization and qualified immunity. \"We obviously want a broader package,\" Harris said. \"The environment is so much more ripe for legislation than it was for the First Step Act.\"Burgess Everett contributed to this report.",
    "Competing proposals from Democrats and Republicans — as well as Trump's executive order — could lead to an impasse.House Democrats on Wednesday will take the first step toward enacting a sweeping police reform bill, with lawmakers in both parties hopeful for a deal even as the two sides remain far from reaching a compromise.Senior Democrats and Republicans are hoping to get something to President Donald Trump’s desk within the next few weeks, worrying that they’ll lose momentum if the negotiations drag beyond the July 4th holiday. And with protests over racial injustice and police brutality still gripping dozens of cities, both parties have moved aggressively to present some kind of legislative framework to address long-ignored problems in policing. But there’s also been little incentive for the two parties to broker a compromise as they each look to lay down their respective markers on reform.“Truth be told, if these conversations had started in the very beginning, I think my answer would be much more affirmative,” Rep. Dean Phillips (D-Minn.), who has privately discussed the legislation with several Republicans, said in an interview. “My unfortunate belief is that absent collaboration from the very beginning, it makes it incredibly difficult.”Still, Phillips, noted: “There’s a lot of common ground right now, my hope is that we at least focus on the common ground and accomplish that now.”The House Judiciary Committee will take up the landmark legislation in a marathon session starting Wednesday morning, three weeks after George Floyd’s death at the hands of Minneapolis officers has galvanized both sides of Capitol Hill into action. The markup comes one week after the panel heard gripping testimony from Floyd’s brother, Philonise Floyd, who pleaded with lawmakers to “stop the pain” and deliver change. But both the committee vote Wednesday and the full House vote next week are expected to largely fall along party lines. Democrats have enough support within their caucus to pass the bill on their own, with no interest in softening their proposal to win over Republicans. Senate Republicans, meanwhile, will release their own police reform bill on Wednesday, which will build on Trump’s executive order and could be on the floor as soon as next week, despite earlier predictions that the Senate wouldn’t take up the bill until after July 4. And leaders in both parties are already publicly bickering. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) slammed Democrats over their bill, which he said was “going nowhere” in the Senate. He said Democrats were seeking to “federalize” the police system and trying to “control everything in Washington.”Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) on Tuesday offered a pointed rebuttal, calling McConnell’s remarks “disgraceful.” “For the leader of the Senate to say, 'It's going nowhere, we don't want any of that,' is really disgraceful — and really ignores the concerns of the American people,” Pelosi said on MSNBC. “I feel very, very disappointed by the dangerous statement made by the Republican leader of the Senate.”Still, lawmakers and aides in both parties say they think there is a path to “yes.” They just aren’t sure how to get there yet. House Democrats assembled their bill — which would crack down on excessive force and ban chokeholds, enforce strict transparency standards and demand accountability for officer misconduct with a national database to track offenses — about two weeks after Floyd’s death. Trump signed an executive order on Tuesday, largely limited to encouraging best practices through federal grants. And the normally sluggish Senate is moving quickly on a GOP-led policing bill that builds upon Trump’s actions.A plan from Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.), the lone African American Republican senator, which POLITICO obtained Tuesday night and is set to be unveiled Wednesday, would create new reporting requirements on the use of deadly force by officers, and reduce federal funding for local departments that fail to comply. It also would limit eligibility for funding for police departments that do not ban the use of chokeholds.Most Democrats have panned the GOP approach as cosmetic and too limited, while Pelosi dismissed Trump’s executive order Tuesday, saying it “falls sadly and seriously short of what is required to combat the epidemic of racial injustice and police brutality.”It’s unclear whether Senate Democrats will join Republicans and try to amend their bill.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) declined to comment on the GOP’s police reform bill, saying it would be “premature” to discuss it before it is formally unveiled. “We haven't even seen the bill yet,” Schumer said. “Let’s wait and see what Tim Scott’s bill is. I have no idea what's in it.”House Democratic lawmakers and aides say privately that they are open to a compromise that will get a bill to the president’s desk. But they don’t see the point of weakening their negotiating position now by cutting a deal with House Republicans when they’ll likely have to later negotiate with Senate Republicans and possibly even Trump himself. The politics in both parties have significantly shifted in the weeks since Americans took to the streets across the country to protest Floyd’s death along with the killings of many other unarmed black men and women by police. Democrats, from the liberal lawmakers who support calls to “defund the police” to centrist in GOP districts, have rallied around a bill that under other circumstances would easily expose the caucus’ ideological divisions. But the united front hasn’t been without missteps. Just on Wednesday, Congressional Black Caucus Chairwoman Karen Bass (D-Calif.) apologized after saying the call to defund the police is “probably one of the worst slogans ever,” vocalizing concerns from many Democrats who worry it could overshadow their police reforms push and give Trump and Republicans a line of attack.“Saying that’s the worst slogan ever was the dumbest response ever and I shouldn’t have said it and I’m sorry for saying it,” Bass tweeted. “I would never mean to malign a movement of activists who I know are fighting for transformative change.”And some Republicans have started warming to the idea of banning chokeholds by police, a policy change that would’ve been unfathomable just weeks ago. But the support isn’t universal within the GOP and it’s unclear how far the party is willing to go on the issue. Senior Democrats, including Bass and House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn (D-S.C.), have privately spoken with several Republicans in recent days as they discussed changes to the package, according to multiple sources. That includes House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) and moderates like retiring Rep. Will Hurd (R-Texas), both of whom have been open to some of Democrats’ ideas.House Democratic leaders did agree to some fixes to the bill, including language to clarify the contentious “qualified immunity section” so that it is more clearly focused on law enforcement personnel and includes federal law enforcement officers, according to a Democratic source. White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany, however, previously said Trump wouldn’t support a measure that included qualified immunity. The amendment would also clarify that the police misconduct registry would make public information like misuse of force and racial profiling, but not mundane complaints like tardiness. It would also limit the use of facial recognition technology from body camera police footage. The technology has come under increased scrutiny for misidentifying individuals and furthering racial profiling. Democrats are not planning additional changes to their bill at Wednesday’s markup — a condition of support for many of the caucus’s moderates who are afraid that their more liberal colleagues will attempt to pull the bill to the left.House Republicans, meanwhile, are still planning to unveil their own proposal to curb police brutality, which they’ve been closely developing with their Senate counterparts as well as the White House. That measure — which is being authored by Rep. Pete Stauber (R-Minn.) — is expected to be released in the coming days and will serve as a companion to the Senate legislation, according to GOP sources.Republicans on the Judiciary Committee are planning to offer dozens of amendments at Wednesday’s markup, with many of them likely to mirror the provisions in Scott’s bill.McConnell, who plans to announce Wednesday whether the chamber will consider Scott’s bill next week, said he plans to hold an initial procedural vote on the bill, which would require 60 votes — essentially daring Democrats to either block the legislation or support an effort that could lead to amendments of the GOP-authored bill. At least seven Democrats would need to support that process, assuming all 53 Republican senators are on board.“What I envision here is an effort to make a law,” McConnell said Tuesday, later adding: “It will really be up to them to decide how they want to handle this. They can either shoot it down as insufficient, or be willing to take the risk to go to the bill and see what changes, if any, we can all agree to in order to get to 60.”Kyle Cheney, Burgess Everett, Marianne Levine and Melanie Zanona contributed to this report.

    "What’s happening in these four blocks that shook the world is indeed an occupation, but it looks nothing like the “totalitarian takeover” touted on the conservative network.SEATTLE — It seems I live in a city undergoing a “totalitarian takeover” that will lead to “fascist outcomes” and could “metastasize across the country.” Its government “has handed over an entire portion of the city to domestic terrorists.” This “group of rogue protesters” is attempting “to get a stranglehold on the city.” This radical “army” of “conquistadors” has “rolled over the police like Cortez rolling over the Aztecs.”Welcome to our world, out here in Seattle—at least according to the hosts and commentators of Fox News. Lesser voices on the digital right have announced even more dire supposed developments: “Rapper-turned-warlord rules commune streets with the iron fist of a privatized police force.” But it’s Fox that has been all over the story of the so-called Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone or CHAZ (which its Black Lives Matter organizers on Saturday renamed the Capitol Hill Organized Protest, CHOP): four-plus blocks of street and sidewalk in Seattle’s traditional gay and bohemian nightlife district, surrounding a boarded-up police precinct headquarters that the mayor ordered vacated last Monday to dampen a week-and-a-half of escalating confrontations between police and protesters. From there, the fluid protests, spearheaded by BLM but involving a wide spectrum of activists and ordinary citizens, coalesced with surprising rapidity into something like a provisional government. What’s going on in these four blocks that shook the world is indeed an occupation, but it looks nothing like the conquista touted on Fox. It’s also the “block party” that Mayor Jenny Durkan has compared it to, to gleeful jeers from Fox commentators. And it’s other things as well—a protean, issue-focused but conceptually sprawling formative community, at once silly and serious, spontaneous and disciplined. Over the course of two evenings and an afternoon in the zone (plus a night observing a police/protest showdown there the week before), it seemed by turns like a commune (as in Paris 1871), an anarcho-syndicalist and small-L libertarian dream, a ’60s-style teach-in, a street fair and street market, a campout and weekend party, a poetry slam and pilgrimage, a school service day, a mass healing circle, a humbler urban version of Burning Man, and of course a protest rally.You’d hardly guess all that from the breathless attention Fox has lavished from Day One on this tiny strip of Seattle—while ignoring, among other peaceful protests, a 60,000-strong BLM march that proceeded in solemn silence through chilly rain and nearly no police presence on Saturday. The litany of elisions, misconceptions and misrepresentations that have spread from Fox’s coverage across social media and in the public and presidential minds may still surprise even those with diminished expectations of the network. The most brazen have been visual. On Friday the Seattle Times revealed three sleights of the photo-editing hand on the Fox site, two of which it managed to preserve before the channel took them down. In one, Fox led a package of stories headlined “Crazy Town: Seattle helpless as armed guards patrol ‘autonomous zone’” with an incendiary photo of a man running between a burning car and building. That photo was actually taken May 30 in St. Paul, Minnesota. Seattle’s protests have produced no such blazes. Fox also undertook two cut-and-pastes of a photo of a young sentinel standing calmly with a semiautomatic rifle on a quiet nighttime street in the zone, which it had already published intact. In one altered image, it set him in front of shattered storefront windows that had been photographed a week before CHAZ/CHOP was set up, more than a mile away. (Storefronts and windows have been spared in the autonomous/organized zone—even those in the vacated police station.) In the other, he stands by a street barrier and a hand-lettered sign reading, “You Are Now Entering Free Capitol Hill.” An editor’s note acknowledging the removal of the storefront mashup called it a “collage,” suggesting it was not intended to look like a single photo.Fox is also slippery in its verbal attributions. It has hammered at the idea that the CHOP has made neighbors alarmed and fearful. But the only purported “resident of this part of the city” it has presented is a “former Seattle City Council candidate” named Ari Hoffman, who said nothing about the neighborhood but inveighed against “domestic terrorists.” One problem: Hoffman, a familiar face on Fox, isn’t from Capitol Hill. He lives in Seward Park, an affluent neighborhood 4 miles away. And when a member of the Police Department’s African American Community Advisory Council told protesters they had “hijacked” the movement and “taken the meaning away,” a Fox headline, echoed in later coverage, blared something very different: “Black Lives Matter protesters say Seattle’s autonomous zone has hijacked message.”Such misrepresentations reverberate in subsequent reports and commentaries, painting a dark picture of the “organized protest” as illegitimate, divided, armed and violent. Many of these tropes derive from an on-camera statement Wednesday by Police Assistant Chief Deanna Nollette. “We’ve been hearing from community members that they have been subjected to barricades set up by the protesters with some armed individuals running them as checkpoints,” Nollette said, adding, “we have heard anecdotally of citizens and businesses being asked to pay a fee to operate within this area. This is the crime of extortion.” Nollette urged “anyone who feels threatened to call 911.”The next day, Police Chief Carmen Best walked back that statement, saying that only “rumors” and social media claimed extortion. At least one such claim is an evident fake. The Greater Seattle Business Association, which is based on Capitol Hill, checked with local businesses and “found no evidence of this occurring.” Detective Patrick Michaud, a Seattle Police spokesman, says the department has received no 911 calls or other complaints about extortion, intimidation, guns or checkpoint barriers in the CHAZ/CHOP.It’s understandable how the barriers around the zone—movable wood and plastic left behind by the police—and the hygienically masked sentinels standing at them could look intimidating to residents. But I passed through them perhaps a dozen times over three days and, like everyone I saw and talked to in the zone, was never stopped or asked my business. Even if this were the “border wall” Fox commentators call it, it would hardly be impenetrable; people could still come and go through the park abutting the zone.I chatted with one of the border guards, a slight young man of East Indian descent with a stick-on name tag reading “Elijah.” He lived in the suburbs, he said, and hadn’t joined in the protests. “I’d seen what the media said,” he explained. “I came out to see what it was like”—and wound up volunteering. The only disturbance he’s seen, he said, “was someone trying to pull the barriers apart. We asked her to stop.” Otherwise, he said, he was “surprised” how mellow it all was. “Some of the nicest people I’ve seen have been here.”The barriers, other guards explained, were there to stop cars from driving into the occupied streets—a real fear. Last Sunday, a motorist drove into the protest at that very intersection and shot a man point-blank who tried to make him stop, hitting his shoulder. He then charged through the crowd, gun in hand and surrendered to police. According to charging documents, he told police he was a security guard, his brother worked at the precinct, and he’d come to the protest “to see how bad it was,” with his Glock on the seat beside him. Fox’s Vandana Rambaran reports, without details, that there have been “multiple shootings,” at the protests. Michaud says Seattle police have received no reports of shootings or guns at protests or in the occupied zone.There have been guns in the zone, however, at least in its first days (I never saw any in later days). The sentinels carrying them belong to a left wing gun rights and self-defense group called the Puget Sound John Brown Gun Club, which offers “support upon request to those in our communities targeted by white supremacists and other agents of oppression and exploitation.” Mindi Welton-Mitchell, a pastor at Seattle’s Queen Anne Baptist Church, was at the “Interfaith Chaplain Table”—where Christian, Jewish and Muslim clergy offer counsel, masks and hand sanitizer—when two John Browners came by and identified themselves. Far from intimidating, she says, they were so inconspicuous, with their guns at their sides, “most people didn’t notice them.”Welton-Mitchell and the other minister at the table, Aaron Monts, saw unarmed barrier attendants deal with a man who approached “screaming and shouting” with a “Don’t Tread on Me” bath towel draped over his shoulders. “They moved him out without touching him,” Monts says. “One talked to him, heard what he had to say, and calmed him down. The de-escalation technique was superb.”Pastors and progressive gun-toters are just the start; just about every conceivable sort of volunteer has brought whatever she or he can offer. “We do not accept $ donations of any kind,” the No Cop Co-Op announces over tables heaped with groceries for anyone who wants them. Other ramshackle stalls and tables offer free clothes, battery charges (for tools and bikes as well as phones) and food, from camp-stove fry-ups to the enormous tureen of crab soup one Asian family ladles into disposable cups. The free books at the Chaz People’s Library and Mutual Aid Books tend to be crisp and movement-friendly. Two women circulate with a handwritten sign offering mental-health help. Yes, they say when asked, we are certified therapists. Others circulate with garbage bags, darting at every scrap of litter. The trash cans are stuffed but I’ve never seen the street so clean.“This is the first time I’ve done this,” says 27-year-old Layla Lacos, standing behind a card table and a handwritten sign saying “Register to vote.” “But I believe passionately in voting.” She figured this might be a good place to enlist new voters, so she secured the necessary forms and a stash of “Vote/Vota” buttons from the county and ventured into the zone. Her hunch seems spot-on. “I just got here an hour ago and I’ve already signed up 30 or 40 registrations and address changes.” Cash-free mutual aid hasn’t entirely dimmed the entrepreneurial spirit. Despite all the free food, people line up for $6 hot dogs at a commercial cart. A vendor stationed in the middle of the street does a land-office business in $30 Black Lives Matter T-shirts. Jordan Lyon, an irrepressibly earnest and enthusiastic young community organizer, is fired up with a more social entrepreneurship. The day before, he brought down four folding chairs and a table, hung signs saying “Conversation Cafe: Let’s make a friend” and “Let’s talk about antiracism,” and wondered if anyone would sit down. Others brought more chairs and couches, until he had some 30 seats arranged in three circles. All are now full, and the conversations hum. Some are confessional, testimonials to racism practiced and experienced. The circle I slip into looks toward broader solutions. A middle-aged African American man who says he works in “construction and performance art” urges the mutual investment that is a perennial, and perennially difficult, goal in black communities. “We need to do what they do in Chinatown,” he says. “Invest in business!” A fair-haired young woman, just graduated from the University of Georgia, wonders if what she learned in her Marxist-Leninist study group might be pertinent. Worlds collide, but gently. “There is a level of trust here that is remarkable,” Lyon says, and I realize he’s talking not just about this conversation space but what he calls the surrounding “commons.” “I see this as potentially permanent. I would so love to see the Black Lives Matter Commons here—like Barcelona superblocks, like [car-banishing] Copenhagen, but about black culture.”Across the street in the park, other volunteers are planting literal roots. Someone has planted four chestnut seedlings, memorials to George Floyd and three local victims of police violence. (Alas, they’re too close together to reach full glory.) Four carefully plotted, compost-heaped vegetable gardens also have taken shape, suitably framed: “This Garden Is for Black and Indigenous Folks and their Plant Allies.” One lead gardener tempers his hopes, however. “I want it to be beautiful so it will look really bad when they tear it up.”On Pine Street, local black artists have laid down a blocklong “street mural” so beautiful and conspicuous officials may shrink from removing it, if they even want to. Seventeen-foot-high, meticulously drawn and painted letters, each by a different artist or team, spell out “Black Lives Matter” in styles by turns whimsical, geometric and symbolic. The project emulates similar new street art in Washington, D.C., and, especially, Charlotte, N.C.This mega-artwork symbolically reclaims embattled turf, ground zero for more than three decades in Seattle’s battles over class, power and race. The precinct headquarters was only located there in the early 1980s because of a community uproar; it was to go in the Central District, the pre-gentrification center of Seattle’s black community, a mile to the east, but activists there resisted. So the cop shop landed on Capitol Hill, where reaction was more muted, even welcoming.In the more turbulent ’90s and 2000s, however, things changed for the testier. Police confrontations with massed street kids and May Day protesters often turned violent. Rioting broke out in downtown Seattle, as elsewhere, in 1992 following the acquittal of the Los Angeles policemen who beat Rodney King, the first on-camera police violence to become a national sensation. Seattle police ill-advisedly pushed the rioters from downtown up Pine Street, where they scattered across Capitol Hill on a smashing and torching spree. The 1999 “Battle in Seattle,” when massive demonstrations shut down the World Trade Organization meeting, culminated on these same blocks as well. Demonstrators, many from the neighborhood, massed below the precinct building until police, backed by National Guard troops, drove them off with barrages of tear gas, flash bangs and rubber bullets. It became a battle for turf, just as the current occupation has. Chants “WTO must go!” gave way to “Get off our hill!”Now that long-simmering local history has come to a boil, precipitated by accumulated outrage at police violence and racial inequity. Everything converges here. Mayor Durkan is as besieged as the precinct building (and like the police, the target of profuse graffiti, the most printable of which proclaims “Impeach Jenny Durkan”). Protesters, and at least a third of Seattle’s left-leaning City Council, want her to resign. Her own police chief has publicly disputed her decision to evacuate the precinct. Critics on the right, including the Seattle Police Officers Guild’s firebrand president, call it craven capitulation. That decision may look better in retrospect, however. It bought time, preventing further, perhaps catastrophic escalation and giving volatile demonstrations the chance to morph into orderly occupation. The name change announced Saturday signaled a further consolidation of the movement, although some media still managed to confuse the issue by calling the new CHOP the “Capitol Hill Occupied Protest.” As one of them explained, BLM organizers had no idea who slapped “CHAZ” on the project, but “Capitol Hill Organized Protest” makes it clear: “This is not an autonomous zone. We’re not trying to secede from the United States,” merely to have “our rights upheld.”An organized protest is one you can negotiate with. City officials, protest representatives and neighborhood business and property owners have begun talking about first steps: cooperating on safety and emergency services, trimming back the CHOP perimeter to let firetrucks and ambulances through. Much bigger issues remain: At a hundreds-strong “people’s assembly” outside the shuttered precinct station, I hear Nikkita Oliver, a charismatic former mayoral candidate and the most visible presence at CHOP public gatherings, lead the throng in a catechism of “core demands”: defund the police, release all arrested protesters, close the precinct. Kshama Sawant, the furthest-left member of our City Council, wants to turn the building into a community center. Unlikely as that last measure may sound, there are precedents. Three hallowed Seattle institutions—the Northwest African American Heritage Museum, El Centro de la Raza, and the United Indians of All Tribes’ Daybreak Star Cultural Center—were born out of protest occupations, the first two of empty schools, the last of an obsolete army fort. At the same time, the city has been steadily closing streets deemed unnecessary for auto traffic to create open pedestrian corridors. Pedestrians are already more dominant on Capitol Hill than in any other district.Perhaps a Black Lives Matter Commons isn’t so far-fetched.",
    "The president’s executive order, set to be unveiled Tuesday, is designed to spur local reforms while drawing contrasts with liberal activists. President Donald Trump hopes to acknowledge a nationwide uproar over police brutality while preventing rifts with police and other law enforcement groups integral to his political future. With an executive order set to be unveiled at a White House event on Tuesday, the president is expected to lay out the case for the creation of a national database of police misconduct, so officers with a history of overly aggressive behavior cannot simply move to another department or state to escape scrutiny, according to a senior administration official. The order will also urge social workers and mental health professionals to work more closely alongside frontline officers. Finally, it will offer guidelines for new training and credentialing for police officers on de-escalating tense situations, and the best times to use force, according to the senior administration official, who said the goal of the order was not to demonize police officers. The White House’s latest move, following weeks of protests in communities across the nation, has been crafted in close consultation with police officers, mayors, conservative African Americans, faith-based leaders and the families of victims, according to people familiar with the planning. Maintaining the political support of police — and appearing like a law-and-order president — has been a leading imperative for Trump’s top aides and political advisers as some liberal activists push to defund police departments and divert money to community programs. In an unrelated White House event on Monday, Trump said the overall goal for the executive order is the desire to maintain “law and order” as well as “justice” and “safety.” “I think this will be very comprehensive,” Trump added, even as the exact details of the order were still being worked out.Trump aides and allies view policing as an area where Republicans can draw sharp contrasts with Democrats ahead of the general election. Part of that contrast is acknowledging the killing of George Floyd and several other innocent African Americans at the hands of what the White House views as rogue police officers. The approach is built on recommending tweaks to policing while leaving wholesale changes to mayors and other local government officials.“The reality is you have to respect our federalist system,” said Ken Blackwell, the former mayor of Cincinnati, former Ohio secretary of state and a longtime conservative leader and Trump supporter. “Safe streets cannot be guaranteed from the Oval Office or the governor’s mansion. That is local leadership.”The executive order will not allot any additional money for new training or the national database, but a senior administration official said police departments that undertake such credentialing will receive priority for federal grants. Additional money for training or police programs will have to come from legislation from Congress, another senior administration official said. Senate lawmakers may not proceed until sometime next month. “The President is committed to making sure law enforcement has the resources and the respect they deserve to be able to do their job,” counselor to the president Kellyanne Conway said Monday on Fox News. “Somebody like the murderous cop in Minneapolis against George Floyd, he had more than a dozen complaints against him. The union is protecting him, he's eligible for a pension. It's all kind of things that can be done so we can ensure people are doing their job.”Top White House aides including senior adviser Jared Kushner, Ja’Ron Smith, chief of staff Mark Meadows and the acting director of the Domestic Policy Council Brooke Rollins spent the last week developing the executive order, along with Republican Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina. They hoped to introduce policies that Democrats can also support, while leaving any major details for police reform to future legislation, said two people familiar with the internal discussions.“We are looking forward to tomorrow and for the president to have the opportunity to have a discussion where he has both police officers and police officer representatives in the room with families of people who were killed by police officers to have the discussion that the country needs to have so that we can turn the anger in this country right now into action,” said a senior administration official.",
    "“Us waiting a month before we vote is a bad decision,\" said Sen. Tim Scott, who is leading the GOP's legislative push. The Senate is unlikely to take up a police reform bill until after the Independence Day recess, Republican leaders said on Monday, raising the prospect that it could be a month or longer before a measure heads to President Donald Trump’s desk.A group of GOP senators, led by Tim Scott (R-S.C.), is expected to file legislation this week that would address policing practices in the aftermath of the May 25 killing of George Floyd, an unarmed African American, at the hands of Minneapolis police. But according to GOP leaders, any floor votes would likely have to wait until at least the week of July 20, after senators return from a two-week recess.“I think it has enough support if we can get a process to move it, possibly,” Senate Majority Whip John Thune (R-S.D.) said, referring to Scott’s bill. “But I would say at this moment probably unlikely in this work period — July, more likely.”Sen. Roy Blunt of Missouri, also a member of Republican leadership, concurred. He also said he does not think the two-week July 4 recess would be canceled.“I’d be surprised if it happens before the July recess,” Blunt said in a brief interview.Scott, for his part, said it would be a mistake to wait. He is urging Senate leaders to take swift action, on the heels of a “positive” phone call he had with Trump on Sunday night.“Without the bill becoming law — whether it’s my bill or some other version of some other bill — then we’ve kind of failed the moment,” Scott said. “Us waiting a month before we vote is a bad decision. So I hope we are willing to take up legislation and just get on the record. If it fails, it fails.”It remains unclear how the Senate will proceed, especially as GOP leaders grapple with whether to draw up another stimulus package to address the economic and public-health challenges presented by the coronavirus pandemic. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) reiterated on Monday that he will make a decision in July “about whether to go forward with a rescue package.” Expanded unemployment benefits expire on July 31, likely necessitating congressional action to aid out-of-work Americans this summer.Sen. James Lankford (R-Okla.), a member of Scott’s working group, noted that the Senate also has to pass the annual defense policy bill, presenting lawmakers with a busy calendar ahead of the August recess.“This is really not a moment where the country cares about partisanship on it. They want to just get it solved,” Lankford told reporters. “It’s hard to determine in a presidential election year because all the politics get pretty noisy as everyone tries to dig in.”Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming, another member of GOP leadership, said he was optimistic that both parties and both chambers could come to an agreement to address the racial injustices that have plagued the criminal justice system.“I expect a bill to become law,” Barrasso said. “I can’t tell you the timing on it, but the goal is to get this done.”House Democrats are scheduled to vote this week at the committee level on a sweeping police reform bill that has the backing of a wide swath of House and Senate Democrats. Republicans have expressed an openness to several provisions laid out in the proposal, but Scott’s plan — which is expected to be released on Wednesday — is expected to garner the backing of congressional Republicans in addition to the White House.McConnell said last week that he had tapped Scott, the lone African American Republican senator, to helm a police reform proposal to address “the obvious racial discrimination that we’ve seen on full display on our television screens over the last two weeks, and what is the appropriate response by the federal government.”Public opinion has swung sharply in favor of reforming the nation’s policing practices in recent days, amid a nationwide uproar over the police killings of Floyd in Minnesota and Breonna Taylor in McConnell’s home state of Kentucky.Scott’s plan, which is still in the works, would establish new reporting requirements on the use of deadly force by police officers and would threaten to cut off federal funding for localities that fail to comply.One of the outstanding issues includes whether to ban the use of chokeholds — a feature of the Democrat-authored proposal, but one that Republicans are hesitant to codify into law at the federal level. Scott’s plan would slash funding for police departments that do not ban the use of chokeholds.In addition to Lankford, Scott’s working group includes GOP Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, John Cornyn of Texas, Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia and Ben Sasse of Nebraska.",
    "The president has remained adamant in his condemnation of athletes kneeling during the national anthem.Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Ben Carson suggested Monday he was working to tamp down President Donald Trump’s public displays of hostility toward professional athletes who kneel during the national anthem to protest police brutality and racial injustice in America.The remarks from Carson, the most prominent African American member of Trump’s administration, came in an interview with conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt, who asked the secretary whether there was “any chance you might persuade the president that he ought not to be upset with players” who take a knee at sporting events.“Well, I don’t think he has manifested as much animosity in that region lately,” Carson replied. “And I think we just continue to work him. He’ll get there.”The mass protests that have unfolded across the United States and around the world following the killing of George Floyd, a 46-year-old black man, by Minneapolis police last month have prompted a reconsideration of the peaceful form of activism led by Colin Kaepernick — the former NFL quarterback who knelt during the anthem as early as 2016.Although Kaepernick and other athletes who joined him in kneeling came under intense criticism from conservatives who claimed they were disrespecting the American flag, opposition to those players and various forms of protest has appeared to soften more recently as the country continues to grapple with a historic racial reckoning.The president, however, has remained adamant in his condemnation of kneeling during the anthem, lashing out last week at NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell after he acknowledged the league was “wrong for not listening” to players earlier and encouraged “all to speak out and peacefully protest.” “Could it be even remotely possible that in Roger Goodell’s rather interesting statement of peace and reconciliation, he was intimating that it would now be O.K. for the players to KNEEL, or not to stand, for the National Anthem, thereby disrespecting our Country & our Flag?” Trump wrote on Twitter in response to Goodell’s video message.After U.S. Soccer’s board of directors voted last week to repeal the federation’s policy requiring players to stand during the anthem, Trump tweeted Saturday that he “won’t be watching much anymore!” The president went on to predict the NFL “is heading in that direction also, but not with me watching!”Carson similarly proposed Monday that perhaps the protests should come to an end — even as police killings of unarmed people of color and other instances of brutality gain focus — arguing that it was no longer necessary for athletes to kneel during the anthem because sufficient national attention had been brought to such issues.“I think most of them are kneeling because, you know, they want to protest some brutality in the police forces. They need to make that very clear,” he said. “And, of course, now that that has been brought to national attention, I’m not sure if it needs to continue.”",
    " (CNN)A jury of 15 people has been selected in Derek Chauvin's trial in the death of George Floyd. And while the jurors are unnamed and unseen on camera, we do know basic details about them.CNN's Brad Parks and Carma Hassan contributed to this report.Six men and nine women have been chosen to serve on the jury during the trial in Minneapolis. Of the 15 jurors, nine are White, four are Black and two are mixed race, according to how the court says the jurors identified themselves.The jury selection process began March 9 at the Hennepin County Government Center and wrapped up Tuesday, exactly two weeks later. The panel will ultimately be made up of 12 jurors and two alternates, so one of the selected jurors will be excused before the trial begins, Judge Peter Cahill said.Floyd, a 46-year-old Black man, died on May 25, 2020, after Chauvin, a White former Minneapolis Police officer, placed his knee on Floyd's neck for an extended period while Floyd pleaded, \"I can't breathe.\" His final moments were captured on video, and his death led to widespread protests against police brutality and racism under the banner Black Lives Matter as well as incidents of unrest and looting.Chauvin has pleaded not guilty to second-degree unintentional murder and second-degree manslaughter charges. He has also pleaded not guilty to third-degree murder, which was reinstated in the case on March 11.If convicted, Chauvin could face up to 40 years in prison for second-degree murder, up to 25 years for third-degree murder, and up to 10 years for second-degree manslaughter. The charges are to be considered separate, so Chauvin could be convicted of all, some or none of them.Opening statements are expected to start March 29, followed by testimony that could take about four weeks.Floyd family attorneys Ben Crump and Antonio Romanucci said in a statement they were pleased the jury had been set. \"After hearing the facts, we hope and expect the jury to deliver a just verdict,\" they said.Three other former officers -- Thomas Lane, J. Alexander Kueng and Tou Thao -- are charged with aiding and abetting second-degree murder and aiding and abetting second-degree manslaughter. They are expected to stand trial this summer. All four ex-officers are out on bail.Who was selectedThe jurors in Chauvin's case all come from Hennepin County, which is demographically about 74% White and 14% Black, according to census data.The prospective jurors previously completed a 16-page questionnaire that asked for their personal thoughts on Black Lives Matter, policing and other topics. In court, each person was sworn in and then questioned one-by-one in a process known as voir dire. The juror's name, address and other information are kept anonymous.Eric Nelson questioned the prospective jurors for the defense, while Steve Schleicher questioned them for the prosecution.The first juror selected is a White man in his 20s or 30s who works as a chemist and said he has an analytical mind.The second juror is a woman of color who appears to be in her 20s or 30s, according to a pool reporter's observations in court. She said she was \"super excited\" about getting the jury questionnaire form.The third juror selected is a White man in his 30s who works as an auditor. He said he supports Black Lives Matter in the general context but doesn't like everything they have done.The fourth juror selected is a Black man in his 30s or 40s who moved to the US 14 years ago and works in information technology. He said that he had a \"somewhat negative\" opinion of Chauvin, that he strongly disagreed with defunding the police and that police make him feel safe.The fifth juror is a White woman in her 50s, according to the court. She said she has a \"somewhat negative\" impression of Chauvin, and believes there are biases against African Americans but not everyone in the system is bad. She said she felt empathy for Floyd as well as the officers because \"at the end of the day I'm sure that the intention was not there for this to happen.\"The sixth juror chosen is a Black man in his 30s, according to the court, who said he had very favorable views of Black Lives Matter. He also said he thought Chauvin had \"no intention\" of harming anyone, but he said he could put that opinion aside in this case.The seventh juror selected is a White woman in her 50s, according to the court. She had a \"somewhat negative\" impression of Chauvin and wrote she \"got the impression he didn't care about\" Floyd.The eighth juror selected is a Black man in his 40s who works in management. He said he had a neutral opinion of Chauvin and had a \"somewhat favorable\" view of both Black Lives Matter and Blue Lives Matter.The ninth juror is a woman of multiple/mixed race in her 40s who said she has a \"somewhat negative\" opinion of Chauvin, but feels safe because of police in her neighborhood, the court said. The court initially incorrectly stated her race as White, but she identifies as multiple/mixed race.The 10th juror is a White woman in her 50s who works as a nurse. She said police in her community make her feel safe, but she noted Black and minority people are not always treated fairly in the criminal justice system.The 11th juror is a Black woman and grandmother in her 50s or 60s who once lived about 10 blocks from where Floyd died. She has a relative that is a Minneapolis Police officer, and said she somewhat agrees that Black people are not always treated fairly in the criminal justice system.The 12th juror is a White woman in her 40s who works in commercial insurance. She has a healthy respect for police officers and a somewhat favorable opinion of Black Lives Matter.The 13th juror is a White woman in her 50s. Until recently, she worked in customer service in a suburban business that was damaged in the unrest after Floyd's death. She said she had a \"somewhat negative\" view of Chauvin, but generally trusts police and believes people who follow their instructions have nothing to fear.The 14th juror is a White woman in her 20s who works as a social worker. She said she had neutral views of Black Lives Matter and Blue Lives Matter and strongly disagrees with defunding the police.The 15th juror is a White man in his 20s who works as an accountant. He said he had a \"somewhat favorable\" view of Black Lives Matter and that he \"strongly agreed\" police in his community make him feel safe.Who was excusedDuring the questioning, the defense and prosecution were able to ask the court to dismiss prospective jurors for cause if they believed the person could not be fair and impartial.Prosecutors and defense attorneys were also able to dismiss prospective jurors without cause, using what's called a peremptory challenge. Chauvin's team was allowed 18 of these challenges and used 14. The prosecution was allowed 10 and used eight.The defense generally used its strikes on people who expressed negative views of Chauvin and positive views of Black Lives Matter, while the prosecution has generally used its strikes on White people who expressed support for police.Two men who had initially been selected to be on the jury were later excused after they told the court that mid-trial news of Minneapolis's $27 million settlement with Floyd's estate affected their ability to be impartial.",
    " (CNN)Most Americans say that people of color in the United States face at least some discrimination, according to a survey published Thursday by the Pew Research Center.A new survey shows that 80% of Americans believe there is \"some\" or \"a lot\" of discrimination against Black people. Seventy-six percent say the same about Hispanic people, while 70% hold the same view about Asian people. Pew said it conducted the survey between March 1 and March 7, before the killings of six Asian women in the Atlanta area this week. Participants were asked to mark how much discrimination different ethnic groups -- Black people, Hispanic people, White people and Asian people -- faced, either \"a lot,\" \"some,\" \"only a little\" or \"none at all.\" Nearly half of respondents, 46%, said Black people face \"a lot\" of discrimination -- a number that has gone up from 2017, when only 39% of respondents said the same. About 30% of respondents said Hispanic people face \"a lot\" of discrimination, and 27% said the same about Asian people. For Hispanic people, that number has gone down from 2017, when 34% said they face \"a lot\" of discrimination. Pew did not provide previous data regarding discrimination against Asian people.Parameters for what constituted \"a lot\" of discrimination versus \"some\" discrimination were not specified by Pew.But 40% of respondents also said White people face at least \"some\" discrimination, with 14% saying White people face \"a lot\" of discrimination, Pew said. Most people who said that were White, Pew said, with about half of White adult respondents saying White people face at least some discrimination. The survey also looked beyond racial discrimination. It asked respondents about discrimination faced by Muslims, gay and lesbian people, women, Jewish people, and Evangelical Christians.\"Majorities of Americans say that Muslims, Jews, gays and lesbians, and women all face at least some discrimination in today's society, while fewer than half (44%) say that Evangelical Christians face some or a lot of discrimination,\" Pew said.The data comes after a wave of racial reckoning in the US following the deaths of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor last year, as well as in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic, which has disproportionately affected Black and brown people.",
    "Minneapolis (CNN)First you see the barricades -- traffic cones, graffitied concrete Jersey barriers and a metal frame that resembles a bike rack.CNN's Jack Hannah and Mallory Simon contributed to this story.Then there's the makeshift guard shack, with so-called community \"Guardians\" inside, regulating the comings and goings on the streets.Finally, a poster declares \"Welcome.\"Beyond the barricades, past the guard hut, at the intersection of Chicago Avenue and 38th Street in Minneapolis is the patch of ground where George Floyd took some of his last breaths as a Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck for several excruciating minutes, even after Floyd's body went limp.Locals wanted it to be a place of peace, justice, mourning and healing. There is a greenhouse growing plants for the memorial to Floyd and caretakers who make sure the area they now call George Floyd Square is clean.But the neighborhood is still dealing with old wounds, new conflicts and fresh violence, even as attention on them is renewed with the beginning of the murder trial for the man accused of killing Floyd.\"We are a grieving community,\" said resident Jeanelle Austin. She grew up three blocks from the square but had left Minneapolis for college, and made her life with a career in faith and race relations. When Floyd was killed her mother told her to come home, that they needed her, that she had the tools and experience in civil rights to help her community heal.She bought a one-way ticket from Austin, Texas, and thought she would stay about two weeks, she said. That was nearly 10 months ago. Austin weeps as she recounts all the messages and gifts she has seen at the memorial, especially those from children who are too young to spell correctly but still understand that something was very wrong. \"By the loss of life in that space, it created it into a sacred space, which is why we call them offerings,\" she said.The grief is fresh, too, not only caused by what happened to Floyd on Memorial Day 2020. Just last weekend a man was shot to death not far from the spot where Floyd once laid motionless. Police did not respond to CNN's request for comment, but a spokesman told USA Today they faced interference when trying to come into the square that Saturday night. Residents choose when to move the metal gate that completes the street barricade, and this time it was them who took the victim to the hospital before police arrived.Police and 'hostages'Distrust of police by the guardians of the square has remained at peak levels.Austin said residents were happy to work with emergency medical services, but police were not welcome in what some are calling an \"autonomous zone,\" though officers have attended several incidents in the area in the 10 months since Floyd's death. On Friday night, a half dozen police cars came through the square, lights flashing in a slow moving chase. Gang warfare is prevalent here, dating back long before Floyd died.\"The police need to work on themselves. There is a distrust they have not corrected themselves. The police work for some people and not for others,\" Austin said.Some residents and activists have formed their own security team, cleaning crew, and even their own medic unit for the square.But it's not a panacea and some locals are frustrated at the go-it-alone attitude, which has not stopped occasional fights, gunfire and a killing.One neighbor, who did not want to be named for fear of reprisal, said, \"There are nights it sounds like a war zone here.\"Another sent a video to CNN from Friday night to prove it. For several minutes, you could hear a barrage of bullets being fired in rapid succession.\"I'm hearing overwhelmingly from community members who, quite frankly, are feeling hostage over there at the situation. And we cannot allow for the violence to continue to happen,\" Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo said during a news conference.Sam Willis Jr., a business owner in the neighborhood, told CNN affiliate WCCO, \"People don't feel safe, they are selling their homes, they hear gunshots, they know the police are not coming into the neighborhood.\" Resident Billy Briggs says he does not judge those who have moved out, but he is staying put, even if it's no longer a place that saw the outpouring of love after Floyd's death. \"There's a lot of factors happening that are making our square not what it was last summer,\" he said.  Briggs, a White man, has lived in this racially mixed neighborhood since the early 1990s and says he loves the community. He's part of the volunteer team that tends to the memorial each day. And each day he updates an old gas station sign that used to show prices per gallon to indicate how many days the court has been sitting in the murder trial of former officer Derek Chauvin.Part battleground, part oasisOn a recent sunny day in the square, there was a child-like joy permeating the space.Several Black women were determined to play Double Dutch in the middle of the street. They danced and giggled while trying to navigate the two jump ropes being twirled in opposite directions. Briggs was asked if he wanted to join in. He decided to take pictures instead.\"I know what this neighborhood is and can be. I'm not going anywhere. This is home,\" he said.But a battle is brewing. The city says it intends to reopen the streets to traffic. It was the city that first installed the concrete barriers last May to protect people from traffic as thousands of mourners and protesters descended on the square to pay their respects. Last month officials determined it was time to remove the barricades, and the mayor has said that would likely happen after the Chauvin trial is completed.It won't happen without a fight. Some activists, residents and caretakers of the square say they have sent 24 demands to the city they believe would create a pathway to restorative justice and healing if and when the blockade goes. They say not one has been met yet.Their list included youth centers, long term community investment, integrated health services, among many other items they wanted the city's help to fund and nurture.For 10 months Austin has dedicated her days to collecting and preserving every single offering to the memorial in memory of Floyd. There are boxes and boxes of items from cut flowers, to children's drawings, to a Roberta Flack record. Each is treated as sacred and preserved as a priceless piece of art.\"We are keepers of the stories of the thousands of people who have come through here to actually lay down their offering as a creative expression of pain and hope,\" she said. \"If you lift those barriers without first providing restorative justice to the community people are going to forget about the harm and trauma caused to the community. The community will never see any kind or form of restorative justice.\"The start of the trial has brought both hope and trepidation.Some residents are nervous about the outcome and what that might mean to their neighborhood. Business owners starved of drive-through traffic by the barricades and the pandemic want the traffic flow. At the same, they are stressed about more potential unrest.As jury selection proceeded last week, the square saw mothers with children, White men in suits, and Black couples come to pay their respects all at the same time.But like the women playing Double Dutch, sometimes it is impossible not to get tangled up. In the south Minneapolis neighborhood where Floyd took his last breaths, the tangle of issues that need to be solved is a microcosm of the situation facing many urban American neighborhoods, long before the world ever heard of George Floyd.",
    " (CNN)The city of Minneapolis will pay the estate of George Floyd $27 million after the city council on Friday unanimously voted to settle a lawsuit with his family.CNN's Steve Almasy contributed to this report. George Floyd's brother, Philonise Floyd, said that he would return the settlement millions if it meant he could see his brother again.\"I thank the state of Minnesota for getting this settlement taken care of,\" he said. \"But even though my brother is not here, he's here with me in my heart. Because if I could get him back, I would give all of this back. \"I know that he's with us, and he's standing up, right now, knowing that we have the opportunity to be able to fund low-income, African American communities.\"Floyd took a moment at a news conference where he was joined by family members, his legal team, and Mayor Jacob Frey to thank the protesters who supported the family, especially during the height of the pandemic this past summer. He also called for peace. \"So, one thing that the world needs to know. America, we need to heal, this nation needs healing. Our family needs healing,\" the emotional Floyd said. George Floyd's sister Bridgett Floyd said in a statement, \"While we will never get our beloved George back, we will continue to work tirelessly to make this world a better, and safer, place for all.\"She said the foundation she started in her brother's name will honor his legacy as a community-minded volunteer.The news comes as jury selection is underway for the trial of Derek Chauvin, a former Minneapolis police officer accused of killing the 46-year-old Black man in May 2020 by kneeling on his neck for almost eight minutes.Floyd's final moments, recorded on video, led to widespread protests against police brutality and racism under the banner Black Lives Matter as well as incidents of unrest and looting.Chauvin has pleaded not guilty to second-degree unintentional murder and second-degree manslaughter charges. He has also pleaded not guilty to third-degree murder, which was reinstated in the case on Thursday.In July, Floyd's family had filed filed the federal civil rights lawsuit against the city of Minneapolis and the four former officers involved in his death.The lawsuit said the city fostered a culture of excessive force and impunity within the police force and failed to terminate dangerous officers. Frey told reporters the settlement reflects a commitment shared by Floyd's family toward racial justice and social progress.\"We need to be unrelenting,\" he said. \"We need to be unapologetic in our pursuit of a more equitable local government and more just approach to community, safety, and our city, and we will be.\"Minneapolis City Council President Lisa Bender offered her \"deepest condolences\" to Floyd's family, friends, and the community.\"No amount of money can ever address the intense pain or trauma caused by this death to George Floyd's family or to the people of our city,\" she said. \"Minneapolis has been fundamentally changed by this time of racial reckoning, and this city council is united in working together with our community and the Floyd family to equitably reshape our city of Minneapolis.\"Family applauds police reformAt the news conference announcing the settlement, Ben Crump, Floyd's family attorney, lauded the city for changes to the police department.\"The settlement is not just historic because of the $27 million paid out but for the impact on social justice policy reforms and police reforms,\" he said. \"Because the financial compensation most directly impacts George Floyd, and his family, the future of his family. But it is the policy reforms that affect all of us.\" Days after Floyd's death, the Minneapolis City Council voted to ban chokeholds, require officers to report other officers they see using chokeholds, and to intervene in such cases. At the time, the mayor vowed to help change the way the city's police department operates, saying \"now we can finally get this right.\"And in July, the mayor and police Chief Medaria Arradondo announced changes to the department's use of force reporting requirements that place a stronger emphasis on de-escalation.The agency is scheduled to see funding cuts after a December in which the city council voted to redirect $7.77 million from the police budget to other programs, according to a news release.The plan funds mental health programs, directs funding toward \"increasing capacity within the Civil Rights Department's Office of Police Conduct Review to investigate complaints about police officer behavior,\" and redirects some nonemergency calls to other departments.Another police shooting resulted in a large settlementIn 2019, the city announced a $20 million settlement following the death of Justine Ruszczyk two years earlier.Ruszczyk, 40, had called 911 to report a possible assault in the alley behind her home. She was shot by former Minneapolis police officer Mohamed Noor, who was responding to her call with his partner.Ruszczyk's 2017 death drew widespread attention, in the United States and in her native Australia. She had moved to Minneapolis to be with her fiancé and was killed a month before her wedding.Noor was convicted of third-degree murder and manslaughter and was sentenced to 12.5 years in prison. He is appealing his sentence.",
    " (CNN)Former Minneapolis Police officer Derek Chauvin now faces an additional murder charge in the death of George Floyd after a Hennepin County judge reinstated a count of third-degree murder on Thursday. CNN's Chris Boyette contributed to this report.Chauvin already faced charges of second-degree unintentional murder and second-degree manslaughter. He has pleaded not guilty to all three charges.The added charge provides prosecutors a third potential pathway to conviction in the closely watched case, which began Tuesday with jury selection at the heavily fortified Hennepin County Government Center.\"The charge of 3rd-degree murder, in addition to manslaughter and felony murder, reflects the gravity of the allegations against Mr. Chauvin,\" Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said in a statement. \"We look forward to presenting all three charges to the jury.\"Attorneys Ben Crump and Antonio Romanucci said in a statement Thursday night that they are \"gratified\" the judge has included a third-degree murder charge.\"The trial is very painful and the family needs closure. We're pleased that all judicial avenues are being explored and that the trial will move forward,\" the statement read.Chauvin was initially charged with third-degree murder in the days after Floyd's May 2020 death, but Hennepin County District Court Judge Peter Cahill dismissed the count in October, saying it did not apply to this case.However, an appeals court ruling in February in the case against former Minneapolis Police officer Mohamed Noor opened the door to reinstating the charge against Chauvin, and the state subsequently filed an appeal of Cahill's ruling.The Minnesota Court of Appeals ordered Cahill to reconsider the motion to reinstate the charge last week. On Wednesday, the Minnesota Supreme Court refused a request by Chauvin's attorney to block the appellate court's decision, clearing the way for Cahill to reinstate the charge.In court on Thursday, Chauvin's defense attorney Eric Nelson argued that Noor's case was factually and procedurally different than Chauvin's interactions with Floyd, in which he knelt on Floyd's head and neck area for an extended period. However, prosecutors argued that the judge was bound to follow the appeals court's precedent in Noor.Judge Cahill ruled Thursday morning that he accepted the appeals court's ruling that the opinion in Noor's case immediately set a precedent, and he ruled to reinstate the charge.He added that the third-degree murder charge only applied to Chauvin and that the potential to reinstate the charge for the three other officers charged in Floyd's death will be addressed at a later date.What the charges meanThird-degree murder, sometimes known as \"depraved mind\" or \"depraved heart\" murder, generally applies to a case in which a person does something eminently dangerous to others without regard for human life, such as randomly firing into a crowd or driving on the wrong side of the road.The second-degree murder charge alleges that Chauvin unintentionally caused Floyd's death while committing third-degree assault, and the second-degree manslaughter charge alleges that Chauvin caused Floyd's death by his \"culpable negligence.\"If convicted, Chauvin could face up to 40 years in prison for second-degree murder, up to 25 years for third-degree murder, and up to 10 years for second-degree manslaughter.The charges are to be considered separate, so Chauvin could be convicted of all, some or none of them.David Weinstein, a former prosecutor who has closely followed the case, said that the charges each represent a different level of intent, so jurors will have more options to consider during deliberations.\"Choices like this can also allow for a compromise verdict by the jury,\" he said. \"The defense would have preferred an all or nothing choice for jurors.\"How we got hereFloyd's final moments were captured on disturbing police and bystander video, and his death led to unrest and fires in the city as well as worldwide protests against police brutality and racism. All four officers involved were fired and charged in Floyd's death. Chauvin is being tried separately due to coronavirus-related limits on courtroom space.The charge of third-degree murder was most recently used in the murder trial of former officer Noor. He was convicted of the charge after prosecutors said he fired his gun at a person outside of his squad car's window, killing Justine Ruszczyk and endangering his own partner.In October, Judge Cahill dropped the third-degree murder charge against Chauvin, ruling the charge can \"be sustained only in situations in which the defendant's actions were 'eminently dangerous to other persons' and were not specifically directed at the particular person whose death occurred.\"The evidence presented by the state does not show that Chauvin's actions were \"eminently dangerous\" to anyone but Floyd, he wrote at the time.In Noor's case, though, an appeals court ruled that third-degree murder can be applied to instances in which a person applies force to a single person.Given that ruling, Ellison filed a motion last month asking a district court judge to reinstate the charge, saying that Noor's sentencing set a new precedent. Appellate court Judge Michelle Larkin agreed, writing that the district court \"erred\" in denying the state's motion to reinstate the charge in light of the Noor opinion.",
    " (CNN)The death that sparked a worldwide movement took center stage in a heavily fortified Minneapolis courtroom on Tuesday as jury selection began in Derek Chauvin's trial in the death of George Floyd.CNN's Chris Boyette, Aaron Cooper, Omar Jimenez and Brad Parks contributed to this report.Floyd, a 46-year-old Black man, died on May 25, 2020, after Chauvin, then a Minneapolis Police officer, placed his knee on Floyd's neck for nearly eight minutes while Floyd pleaded, \"I can't breathe.\" His final moments were captured on video, and his death led to widespread protests against police brutality and racism under the banner Black Lives Matter as well as incidents of unrest and looting.Chauvin has pleaded not guilty to second-degree unintentional murder and second-degree manslaughter charges. He has also pleaded not guilty to a charge of third-degree murder that was reinstated on Thursday.Jury selection in the trial began Tuesday at the Hennepin County Government Center and is expected to last about three weeks. Opening statements are expected to start no earlier than March 29, followed by testimony over the next two to four weeks.Here's what we know about the jurors picked so far.How jury selection goesIn a case with so much media attention, it may be impossible to find a jury that hasn't heard about Floyd's death. But the goal is not to find ignorant people; it's to find jurors who can be impartial and are open to hearing the evidence and the law.\"No matter what a potential juror has seen or heard, can they set that aside and base their decision on evidence in court and the law the judge gives them?\" said Mary Moriarty, the former chief Hennepin County public defender.In December, prospective jurors were sent a 16-page questionnaire asking for their thoughts on Black Lives Matter protests, their views on policing and their personal interactions with police.Starting Tuesday, prospective jurors who completed the questionnaire were questioned one by one in court in a process known as voir dire. The juror's name, address and other information is kept anonymous.The judge first asks questions of the prospective juror, followed by the defense and then the prosecution. If the defense or prosecution believes the person cannot be impartial in the case, they can ask the court to dismiss the person for cause. Each side has unlimited challenges for cause.Prosecutors and defense attorneys can also move to dismiss prospective jurors without cause using what's called a peremptory challenge. Chauvin's team has 15 of these challenges and the prosecution has nine, according to the court. These peremptory challenges can themselves be challenged, though, if they are based on race, ethnicity or sex -- known as a Batson challenge.The process continues until the court decides on 14 people -- split into 12 jurors and two alternates, Hennepin County Court Director of Communications Spenser Bickett told CNN. Who's who in the trialGeorge Floyd, 46, was born in North Carolina and raised in Houston and moved to Minnesota as an adult for a fresh start, working as security at a restaurant.On May 25, 2020, police were called about a man who had used a $20 counterfeit bill at a Minneapolis store. Officers were directed to a parked car with Floyd in the driver's seat, and they handcuffed him and moved to put him into the back of a police car, according to the amended complaint.Two other officers, including Chauvin, then responded to the scene and struggled to get Floyd into the vehicle, the complaint states. Chauvin allegedly pulled Floyd to the ground in a prone position and placed his knee on Floyd's neck and head. His knee remained there even as Floyd pleaded, \"I can't breathe,\" said \"I'm about to die\" and ultimately stopped breathing, the complaint says. He was pronounced dead at a hospital shortly after.The Hennepin County Medical Examiner's autopsy listed the cause of death as heart failure \"complicating law enforcement subdual, restraint, and neck compression,\" and ruled it a homicide. The medical examiner also noted arteriosclerotic and hypertensive heart disease; fentanyl intoxication; and recent methamphetamine use as \"other significant conditions.\"Medical examiners hired by Floyd's family also ruled it a homicide but said Floyd died of \"asphyxiation from sustained pressure\" during the arrest.Derek Chauvin, 44, had been an officer with the Minneapolis Police Department since 2001 until he was fired in the wake of Floyd's death. He was the subject of at least 18 prior complaints, two of which were \"closed with discipline,\" according to a department internal affairs public summary.A motion to dismiss the charges filed last August previewed his possible defense. In that filing, his attorney argued that Chauvin had no intent to harm Floyd while restraining him, that he was acting within police policy, and that Floyd's cause of death was the result of a drug overdose and other existing health issues.Thomas Lane, J. Alexander Kueng and Tou Thao, all former Minneapolis Police officers, were also on scene with Chauvin and are charged with aiding and abetting second-degree murder and aiding and abetting second-degree manslaughter. They have pleaded not guilty.Due to limits on courtroom space because of the pandemic, their joint trial was moved to this summer. They will not testify in Chauvin's trial, but their names, statements and actions will be heavily featured.Eric Nelson is Chauvin's defense attorney and will represent him at trial. He is part of the Halberg Criminal Defense practice and has worked exclusively in criminal defense since being admitted to the bar, according to his online bio.Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison's office says the three main presenting prosecution attorneys are Jerry Blackwell, Matthew Frank and Steve Schleicher.Peter Cahill is the Hennepin County judge overseeing the case. He was first appointed to the bench in 2007 and has been reelected to the position three times since, most recently last November.An explanation of the chargesChauvin is charged with second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter.The second-degree unintentional murder charge alleges that Chauvin killed Floyd \"without intent\" while he committed or attempted to commit felony third-degree assault, which is defined as inflicting \"substantial\" bodily harm. The charge is punishable by up to 40 years in prison.The third-degree murder charge alleges that Chauvin caused Floyd's death \"by perpetrating an act eminently dangerous to others and evincing a depraved mind, without regard for human life.\" The charge is punishable by up to 25 years in prison.The second-degree manslaughter charge alleges that Chauvin caused Floyd's death by \"his culpable negligence, creating an unreasonable risk and consciously took the chances of causing death or great bodily harm.\" \"Culpable negligence\" is essentially a heightened form of ordinary negligence, Moriarty explained. The charge is punishable by up to 10 years in prison.How the pandemic changed the trialThe possibility of a courtroom Covid-19 outbreak looms, so the court has taken a number of steps to prevent one.Everyone who attends the Chauvin trial will be required to distance from others and wear a mask, although witnesses and attorneys may remove their masks during testimony and other court statements. Plexiglass has been installed around the courtroom as well.In addition, the trial will be livestreamed for those not able to attend, a first for a Minnesota criminal trial.Only one member of Floyd's family and Chauvin's family will be allowed to attend the trial because of the Covid-19 restrictions. For each family, a different family member can rotate through that in-court position with appropriate credentials, the judge ruled.During the trial, the jurors will be partially sequestered during the day but will be allowed to return to their homes at night. They will be fully sequestered during deliberations.How police are preparingGiven the unrest and looting that ensued when Floyd died, local and state authorities are taking major security measures. The Hennepin County Government Center is now surrounded by fencing and barricades, and the building will be empty aside from those participating in Chauvin's trial and approved staff.Mayor Jacob Frey said the city is preparing for potential unrest with \"painstaking detail.\" He said up to 2,000 National Guard members will be prepared to respond along with up to 1,100 law enforcement pooled from 12 other jurisdictions. \"Safety is a top priority through this very difficult time in our city,\" Frey said last month. \"There's great frustration, there's anxiety, and there's trauma. We anticipate that trauma increasing as we get closer to jury deliberations.\" Minnesota law enforcement leaders last month outlined their plan to work together to provide security during the trial in what they called \"Operation Safety Net.\"State Patrol Col. Matt Langer said the goal is to protect lawful protests and demonstrations while preventing violence, property damage, fires and looting.\"Planning for this operation occurred starting back in July,\" Langer said. \"It occurred in earnest all summer.\"Operation Safety Net is organized into four phases, according to Langer: (1) Planning and preparation, (2) jury selection; (3) closing arguments, deliberations and a verdict; and (4) demobilization. Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo said the unified command will help everyone stay on the same page.\"It will allow all of us to be able to respond metro and region wide, if needed, and it will allow great cooperation coordination and communication,\" he said.Minnesota Department of Public Safety Commissioner John Harrington said last month the actions were all precautionary.\"As of right now, we do not have any current, actionable intelligence about groups planning to come here to disrupt the trial or to cause disorder,\" Harrington said. \"We are exercising this unified command out of caution.\"",

    " (CNN)White and Black Americans' perceptions of race relations and the circumstances around George Floyd's death remain split, a new poll has found.CNN's Priya Krishnakumar contributed to this report.Ahead of the trial of Derek Chauvin, a former Minneapolis Police officer charged with the murder of George Floyd, a USA Today/Ipsos poll explored America's views on race, policing and Floyd's killing. The poll was conducted March 1 and 2 and based on a nationally representative sample of 1,165  people ages 18 and older. The poll findings come just days before the one-year anniversary of Breonna Taylor's death in Louisville, Kentucky. When asked about Floyd's death, 64% of Black people described it as a murder, according to the poll. Among White respondents, 28% described it as murder and 33% said \"it was negligence on part of the officer.\" Clifford Young, president of public affairs in the United States for Ipsos, said the contrast in responses extends to nearly every question in the survey.\"Black Americans, for instance, and minorities in general are still super focused on this issue. It hasn't gone away. It can't go away because they live with it every day,\" Young said. USA Today/Ipsos conducted a similar poll in June as protests condemning police brutality took place across the United States. Last year, 60% of all respondents described Floyd's death as murder. That number dropped to 36% in the latest poll.Floyd, a 46-year-old Black man, died on May 25, 2020, after Chauvin placed his knee on Floyd's neck for nearly eight minutes while Floyd pleaded, \"I can't breathe.\" His death sparked a worldwide movement and America became the epicenter of a racial reckoning.In the months that followed, people protested in the streets and headed to the polls with Black, Latino and Native Americans voters flipping some states blue during the presidential election. More recently, critics saw White privilege in the police response to the US Capitol insurrectionists compared to the response to protests over Floyd's death.After months of racial reckoning, views over whether race relations have changed are also divided.Overall, more Americans (47%) believe race relations have neither improved nor worsened in the past year, the poll shows. But 40% said they feel race relations actually worsened and only 13% said they had improved.Among Black Americans, 54% say race relations have worsened in the past year, while 10% believe they have improved. But more White Americans (51%) feel they have neither improved nor worsened and 35% said they have worsened, according to the poll.Young said researchers were surprised by the results of the poll, which, he says, shows that racial justice is no longer \"front and center\" in many people's minds, especially for those who are not impacted daily.\"It's disheartening,\" Young said.\"What was very clear for us is that when it comes to racial justice issues, it's sort of 'out of sight, out of mind' for most Americans,\" he added. \"In other words, either there's an acute problem like the George Floyd killing that brings to the forefront the issue and everyone pays attention, but if not, it's sort of recede in the memory and people focus on other things.\"",
    "The family of George Floyd, the Black man who died while being arrested by a white police officer in Minneapolis, has reached a $27 million “wrongful death” settlement with the Minnesota city, lawyers for the family announced Friday.“The $27 million settlement is the largest pre-trial settlement in a civil rights wrongful death case in US history,” the lawyers said in a statement.Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, 44, is currently on trial facing murder and manslaughter charges for his role in Floyd’s death, which was captured on video by bystanders and sparked protests against racial injustice around the globe.Chauvin was seen on the video kneeling on the neck of the 46-year-old handcuffed Floyd for nearly nine minutes on May 25, 2020.Three other police officers—Tou Thao, Thomas Lane, and J. Alexander Kueng—also face charges in connection with his death.“George Floyd’s horrific death, witnessed by millions of people around the world, unleashed a deep longing and undeniable demand for justice and change,” said Ben Crump, a Floyd family lawyer.“That the largest pre-trial settlement in a wrongful death case ever would be for the life of a Black man sends a powerful message that Black lives do matter and police brutality against people of color must end,” Crump said.The settlement results from a federal lawsuit the Floyd family filed in US District Court in July against the city of Minneapolis.“Even as the trial against former officer Derek Chauvin moves forward and the family waits for justice in the criminal courts, this settlement imparts a measure of justice that is meaningful, important and necessary,” said another family attorney, L. Chris Stewart.“It provides a path forward for our clients and ensures that George Floyd’s death will result in substantive, positive change.”‘Some closure’Floyd’s brother Rodney said the agreement is “a necessary step for all of us to begin to get some closure.”“George’s legacy for those who loved him will always be his spirit of optimism that things can get better, and we hope this agreement does just that,” he said.The $27 million settlement includes $500,000 to improve the business district in Minneapolis where Floyd died.In the statement, the legal team for the Floyd family praised police reforms adopted by the city of Minneapolis after Floyd’s death and pledged support for further reforms.Following Floyd’s death, the Minneapolis Police Department agreed to keep body-worn cameras on at all times, to de-escalate non-threatening encounters with citizens by disengaging or walking away, and other measures.“We are encouraged both by the progressive police reforms already adopted and the ambitious changes city of Minneapolis leaders still hope to create,” said Antonio Romanucci, another Floyd family lawyer.Jury selection is currently taking place in Chauvin’s trial in a heavily guarded Minneapolis courtroom.Seven jurors have been selected so far for the case and seven more need to be chosen in upcoming days.Opening arguments are expected to begin on March 29.Chauvin faces charges of second-degree murder, third-degree murder and manslaughter.The most serious charge—second-degree murder—carries a maximum sentence of 40 years in prison.(AFP)",
    "The potential jurors entered a Minneapolis courtroom one by one on Tuesday and although they had never met Derek Chauvin in person, they said they knew exactly who he was: the police officer who kept his knee on George Floyd's neck during a deadly arrest last year that caused a worldwide outcry.Nearly all told the court they had seen the video of the May 25 arrest recorded on a bystander's phone showing Floyd, a 46-year-old Black man, begging for his life, which spread inescapably across the internet and other media.Many conceded they had already formed a negative opinion of Chauvin, who was dismissed from the police force.\"That's the only thing I've ever seen of this person: that video,\" Juror No. 9, a woman who appeared to be mixed race in her 20s or 30s, told the court, trying to describe her views on Chauvin, who is white. \"It just makes you sad. Nobody wants to see someone die, whether it's his fault or not.\"Still, she was \"super excited\" to receive the jury summons, a feeling that only grew after she realised that it would be for one of the most high-stakes cases seen in the United States in years.After assuring Judge Peter Cahill of Hennepin County district court that she would be fair and impartial she became the second of three jurors seated on the first day of jury selection.\"Awesome!\" she replied to the judge.Chauvin, released from jail last October on a $1 million bond, stood politely when he was introduced to potential jurors by his lawyer. Dressed in a gray suit, dark tie and black face mask, Chauvin filled pages of a yellow legal pad with notes.His trial is seen as a landmark case on police violence against Black people in the United States. Many of the issues that prompted the judge to set aside three weeks for selecting 12 jurors and four alternates alone quickly came to the fore on Tuesday.There was a commonplace belief that parts of the American criminal justice system are racist, as seen in the nervous 19-year-old man who said when questioned by Chauvin's lawyer Eric Nelson that he distrusts the police and recalled his father being racially profiled during a traffic stop. The judge dismissed him.Despite the judge promising jurors anonymity for the duration of the trial, some feared becoming a target or said they were unnerved by the rings of barbed-wire fencing and concrete barricades around the tower in downtown Minneapolis in which the trial is being held.One potential juror, a self-described Christian family man, wondered if his house might be spray-painted or his windows smashed if his name got out. The judge dismissed him, too.Chauvin's lawyers also used up two of their 15 peremptory challenges by which they can reject a juror without citing a reason, while prosecutors from the Minnesota attorney general's office used up one of their nine.But after a second Hispanic person was rejected by the defense, prosecutors complained that the defense was illegally excluding jurors on the basis of race, which the defense denied. The judge concluded there was insufficient evidence to overturn their dismissal.The court had mailed prospective jurors an unusually detailed 16-page questionnaire last year asking them what they know about Floyd's death, and asking for their opinions on the Black Lives Matter movement, which took hold globally following Floyd's death in police custody.The second potential juror called in, a white man working as a chemist in an environmental testing laboratory, said he \"somewhat disagreed\" with the assertion that Minneapolis police generally use disproportionate force against Black people.He said he supported Black Lives Matter and that he understood it to mean that \"all lives matter equally.\"Cahill told him soon after that he would be the first juror to be seated.Chauvin's lawyers say he properly followed the training he was given by the Minneapolis police department. The medical examiner ruled that Floyd's death was a homicide caused partly by police restraint holds, but noted also Floyd had recently ingested the opioid fentanyl. Chauvin's lawyers contend that an overdose was the main cause of death.One potential juror, a financial auditor, said he had seen on the news that Floyd had used \"hard\" drugs and had been convicted of crimes in the past but would not let that affect his weighing evidence presented at the trial. Floyd had been convicted of cocaine possession and robbery in the past.\"Whether you're under the influence of drugs doesn't determine whether you should be living or dead,\" the man said. He became the third and final juror seated on Tuesday.(REUTERS)",
    "Minneapolis residents braced for the opening on Monday of what is sure to be one of the nation's most closely watched trials in years -- that of the white policeman charged with killing George Floyd, a Black man whose dying struggles were captured on a video seen around the world.Jury selection begins at 8:00 am (1400 GMT), though final debates over the exact charges against Derek Chauvin -- the now former city officer who used his knee to pin a pleading, gasping Floyd by the neck to the pavement for nearly nine minutes -- could yet delay the proceedings.For now, Chauvin is facing second-degree murder and manslaughter charges. He has been released on bail and will appear in court.Floyd's death laid bare already sore racial wounds in the United States, sparking months of sometimes violent protests against racial injustice and police brutality, both in the US and abroad.Lawyers for both sides face the difficult task of finding jurors who, in the intensely publicised case, have not already made up their minds about Chauvin's guilt.The process is expected to take up to three weeks, with arguments slated to begin on March 29.But protesters already gathered near the courthouse on Sunday, with many holding up \"Black Lives Matter\" placards and demanding \"justice for George Floyd.\"Chauvin's case promises to be extraordinary: it will feature star attorneys, be held under tight security and be livestreamed.It will also be watched as a potential marker of change in a country that recently elected its first Black vice president, but where police officers historically have often escaped punishment for abusive acts.It will feature gripping testimony, as foreshadowed Sunday by Benjamin Crump, a prominent civil rights attorney representing the Floyd family.\"You look at the video, and you hear him say 28 times, 'I can't breathe,'\" Crump told ABC's \"This Week.\"\"The public is begging the police to take the knee off his neck. They say his nose is bleeding; he can't breathe; he is going unconscious -- you're going to kill him.\"Amid the Covid-19 pandemic, social distancing rules mean seating will be limited, with the Floyd and Chauvin families given only one seat a day.Despite intense global interest, only two reporters will be allowed in each day.The Minnesota attorney general's office brought in Neal Katyal, a former US acting solicitor general who has argued cases before the Supreme Court, to help with the prosecution.Ashley Heiberger, a former police officer who now works as an advisor on police practices, said: \"The fact that a police officer has been charged criminally for an abusive use of force, that in and of itself is an outlier.\"\"It's even rarer for them to be convicted.\"The circumstances surrounding 44-year-old Chauvin's case, however, are so troubling that \"to the best of my knowledge, no police officers or police organizations came out and defended his action,\" Heiberger said.Three other police officers involved in Floyd's arrest -- Alexander Kueng, Thomas Lane and Tou Thao -- face lesser charges and will be tried separately.All four officers were fired by the Minneapolis Police Department.Floyd's arrest was prompted by accusations that he tried to pass a counterfeit $20 bill in a nearby store.'Exactly as he was trained to do'Chauvin, a 19-year veteran of the force, was released from prison on bail in the fall and is expected to plead not guilty to the murder and manslaughter charges.\"Mr. Chauvin acted according to MPD policy, his training and within his duties as a licensed peace officer of the State of Minnesota,\" according to his lawyer, Eric Nelson. \"He did exactly as he was trained to do.\"According to Nelson, Floyd died of an overdose of fentanyl.An autopsy did find traces of the drug in Floyd's system but said the cause of death was \"neck compression.\"It will take a unanimous verdict by the 12-member jury to put Chauvin behind bars for what could be a long prison sentence.A hung jury could give rise to another wave of anti-racism demonstrations.The authorities have mobilized thousands of police officers and members of the National Guard to provide security and the courthouse has been surrounded by concrete barriers and barbed-wire fencing.Outside, thousands of protesters marched around the courthouse on Sunday, bearing a replica coffin covered in roses and a banner printed with Floyd's last words: \"I can't breathe.\"Several told AFP they worry Chauvin will walk free.\"I hope that our legal system allows all evidence to be presented and that we get a conviction, but I don't expect it,\" said Billie Jean Vanknight, a 43-year-old Black woman.Prospective jurors have been presented with a 16-page questionnaire.\"How favorable or unfavorable are you about Black Lives Matter?\" is one of the questions.\"Have you ever watched video of George Floyd's death?\" is another. \"If yes, how many times?\"A verdict is not expected until late April.(AFP)",
    "In a year of general upheaval, 2020 also gave rise to mass protests around the world. Though some tackled familiar themes like democratic freedoms, women’s rights and racial justice, others found new causes to rally behind as the emergence of Covid-19 sparked demonstrations against government lockdowns and mask mandates. FRANCE 24 takes a look back at some of the protests and civic disobedience movements that marked the year.Coronavirus sceptics and anti-maskersCountries struggling to contain the first outbreaks of the deadly Covid-19 virus quickly fell into lockstep on the main strategies for \"flattening the curve\": imposing strict lockdowns, social distancing and mandating the wearing of masks when possible. But governments everywhere have had to grapple with fierce blowback from groups opposed to these strategies.In Europe, Germany has emerged as the epicentre of the anti-lockdown movement, which has attracted an eclectic mix of young and old, far-right extremists, Covid-19 sceptics, anti-vaxxers and conspiracy theorists. Calling themselves “lateral thinkers”, they are part of a global phenomenon of those who see themselves as defenders of individual freedoms as they eschew masks and defy social distancing measures to congregate en masse for the cause.On the weekend of August 29, coordinated rallies, some turning violent, took place across Europe. Nearly 20,000 Covid-19 sceptics marched against pandemic restrictions in Berlin while in London, 10,000 gathered to call the pandemic a hoax, some holding aloft signs with “Anti-vax deserves a voice”, “End to Government lies” or “Freedom over fear”.In Paris, anti-mask rallies in August drew only a few hundred people with marginally larger demonstrations in Brussels, Dublin, Madrid, Rome, Rotterdam and Zurich – protests occurred even in Italy, where Covid-19 took an exceptionally high toll. Anti-maskers have accused governments of manipulating people through fear and claim there is no scientific justification for making them mandatory.In the United States, anti-lockdown demonstrators and supporters of President Donald Trump – who himself has consistently played down the severity of the virus – joined forces to protect what they claimed was an assault on individual rights, despite skyrocketing infections that would eventually catapult the country to the top of global mortality rates. In some states protesters stormed government offices while in Michigan a group of men were accused of plotting to kidnap Governor Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat who had become a lightning rod for anger over coronavirus measures.By April nationwide protests spiked after a series of tweets from President Trump on April 17, urging Americans in states where leaders had imposed restrictions to “liberate” themselves. Critics have blamed Trump, who has refused lockdowns and other anti-virus interventions, for fomenting the movement.Echoing the outgoing US president’s sentiments, anti-mask and anti-lockdown advocates say enforced restrictions have come at too high a cost, that of a sinking economy and a recovery that could be years in the making.Global protests against racial injustice and police brutalityThe death in police custody of George Floyd, a 44-year-old African-American man, on May 25 in Minneapolis sparked a wave of anti-racism protests in the US and around the world. Video images shared on social media showed Floyd being held down, a policeman's knee on his neck, as he repeatedly pleaded for air before he died.“I can’t breathe,” Floyd’s last words, were brandished on protest signs. It was not the first time a Black man had died at the hands of US police while pleading for air. \"I can't breathe\" has been chanted at protests against racism among police ever since the 2014 death of Eric Garner, who was filmed repeating those words as he was restrained by an NYPD officer.Just two months before Floyd’s death, Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old health worker, was shot dead by police during a botched raid on her apartment. The police were looking for a suspect who did not live at Taylor's residence. A new round of protests calling for justice for Taylor erupted in September when a grand jury ruled against convicting the officers involved in her death.These and other incidents revived the US Black Lives Matter movement and the #BLM hashtag that first surfaced in 2013. Across the US, more than 4,700 demonstrations waved the BLM banner with protests against Floyd’s death peaking on June 6, when half a million people turned out in nearly 550 locations across the country.Outrage against police also spilled onto the streets of Paris, where Floyd’s death shined a new spotlight on the case of Adama Traoré, a 24-year-old Black man who died in 2016 after being restrained by French police. His sister, Assa, led several anti-racism protests in which young and old, Black and White, working-class and middle-class were united in their calls for justice for Traoré. In June more than 10,000 gathered in Paris with demonstrations also taking place in Marseille, Lille and Lyon.In cities as far-flung as Sydney and Melbourne people also marched to highlight high rates of incarceration and deaths in custody among Aboriginal Australians.Anti-racism activists expanded their message, pointing to the lingering injustices due to the legacies of slavery and colonialism. Others took matters directly into their hands by defiling or pulling down statues of historical figures who profited from or supported the slave trade. In the UK and the US establishments like bars and pubs went so far as to change their names in a sign of solidarity with the BLM movement.Protests erupt against Lukashenko in BelarusWomen precipitated the largest anti-government protests ever seen in Belarus after a contested presidential vote on August 9 saw the re-election of President Alexander Lukashenko, who has been in power since 1994. The opposition and its supporters have called on Lukashenko to quit, denouncing the election as rigged and keeping up demonstrations with as many 100,000 thronging the city of Minsk.Solidarity for the opposition remains strong even as leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya is in exile in Lithuania. But despite EU sanctions and international calls for democracy to be upheld little has changedMore than 30,000 people are believed to have been arrested in Belarus since mass protests began, many facing fines or even lengthy prison sentences. Protests are now a fixture on the calendar for Belarus’s beleaguered pro-democracy movement and they show no signs of lifting the pressure on Lukashenko’s regime.Macron sparks anger and a boycottMuslim voices rose in protest against French President Emmanuel Macron in October after he defended the secular values (laïcité) of the French Republic, denouncing Islamist extremism and vowing not to give up the \"right\" to caricature.At a ceremony honouring school teacher Samuel Paty, who was murdered by a Chechen Islamist who was outraged that Paty showed students caricatures of the Prophet Mohammed during a class on freedom of expression, Macron hailed Paty as a hero for representing the free-thinking values of the French Republic, including the right to mock religion.\"I can understand that people could be shocked by the caricatures but I will never accept that violence can be justified,\" Macron later said in a speech.Anger and outrage at his comments erupted in the Middle East and parts of Asia. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan called for a boycott of French goods, questioned Macron's mental health and said he had a problem with Muslims – prompting France to recall its ambassador.Effigies of the French president along with the French flag were burned as protesters amassed in their thousands in Pakistan, Lebanon, Palestinian Territories and Afghanistan and elsewhere in the Muslim world.Macron’s government was again accused of Islamophobia after it unveiled new laws against \"Islamist separatism\" on October 2. Macron triggered more scorn by declaring Islam to be a religion \"in crisis all over the world” and said the religion could instead be remade into “an Islam of the Enlightenment”.When the UK’s Financial Times published an opinion piece on November 3 that argued Macron’s words were alienating Muslims in France, the president challenged the piece, saying it contained factual errors. Macron then launched a broader attack on the Anglophone press that included the New York Times and sought to placate Muslims by explaining that France was fighting radical Islamism and not Islam itself.His tough tone have led some to speculate that Macron is already in campaign mode ahead of a 2022 presidential election, with his hardened stance a possible attempt to lure votes from far-right leader Marine le Pen.#EndSARS in NigeriaFor nearly two weeks in October, thousands of angry young Nigerians intensified calls to end police brutality and human rights violations by disbanding one of the country’s most notorious police units.The Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) was set up in Lagos in 1992 to combat armed criminals but was later accused of extreme human rights violations, with victims claiming officers regularly engaged in extrajudicial killings, enforced disappearances, torture and kidnapping.Led primarily by youth groups, the protests have been going since 2017 but it was not until they launched a social media campaign under the hashtag #EndSARS that their cause gained wider support, spreading to 21 cities across Nigeria.Dear @aliciakeys, youths in Nigeria still remember your song “we are here”. Please be here for all of us now and lend your voice to the #EndSarsNow campaign. Just a tweet on #EndSARS please pic.twitter.com/IJIZsw1TUiPresident Muhammadu Buhari responded by crushing the growing movement and tossing hundreds of protesters in jail, where many remain today. Their cause has now been taken up by US Black Lives Matter co-founder Opal Tometi, Greta Thunberg and even singer Alicia Keys, who are among a coterie of international celebrities to sign an open letter to Buhari for the release of the activists. They have also urged the president to lift a nationwide ban on protests and to allow Nigerians a democratic voice.According to Amnesty International SARS isn’t the only problem, with the Nigerian police also responsible for hundreds of extrajudicial killings and disappearances every year.Poland's crackdown on abortion sparks outrageWhile abortion rights have been hard-fought in many countries, they came under attack in Poland again in October when the top court ruled it unconstitutional to abort a foetus because of defects, thus eliminating one of the few legal reasons to seek an abortion in the deeply Catholic country.The ruling right-wing Law and Justice (PiS) party proposed the constitutional changes to the law in a crackdown that would impose an almost total ban on abortion.Tens of thousands of women, and men, poured onto the streets in a string of nationwide rallies in repudiation of the changes – and in defiance of a Covid-19 ban on mass gatherings. Holding up signs bearing a red lightning bolt they chanted the slogan, “I think, I feel, I decide” in a message that resonated with women around the world.The anti-abortion protests were among Poland’s largest in decades, not seen since the Solidarity movement of the 1980s that led to the collapse of the Soviet government.But others have also joined the fray – from farmers to entrepreneurs – swelling protesters’ ranks and coalescing around a common goal of overthrowing the government.“We are going for freedom. We are going for everything!” was the slogan for the latest demonstration on December 13. President Jaroslaw Kaczyński has called the protesters “criminals”.Though a final court ruling is on hold in Poland, in Argentina women claimed a small victory with lawmakers backing an abortion bill which will now go to the senate before approval.A contentious US electionSoon after Election Day on November 3 it became clear that this US presidential election would be contested both at the ballot box and on the streets.As vote counting continued in several battleground states such as Pennsylvania and Georgia, which were too close to call on polling day, President Trump seized on the delay in final results to claim the election had been stolen. Trump supporters rallied to cries of “Stop the Count” and “Stop the Steal” outside voting centres in multiple cities during regular weekend protests throughout November, at times facing off against Biden supporters who called for every vote to be counted.pic.twitter.com/4lH5PZRI9COn November 14 the post-election protests peaked with a \"MAGA March\" in Washington, DC. Just five blocks from the White House, thousands of pro-Trump and anti-Trump protesters brawled, some armed with batons, before riot police used stun guns and teargas to disperse the crowds. Several arrests were made and one person was stabbed.Another flashpoint occurred when a pro-Trump group, Women for America First, organised a rally in the capital on December 12, when disparate groups coalesced and clashed with opponents in yet another worrying show of a profoundly divided United States. A White nationalist group known as the Proud Boys, members of the religious far-right and grassroots MAGA (Make America Great Again) groups were all in Washington in overlapping protests in support of Trump. Scuffles ensued when Black Lives Matter (BLM) demonstrators and \"antifa\" (leftist anti-fascist groups), exchanged insults with members of the Proud Boys. Four people were stabbed and several were arrested.The US president has refused to concede defeat despite the US Electoral College finalising Biden’s victory on December 14. Trump has also lost more than 50 legal challenges filed against the election results in state and federal courts.French 'security law' sparks mass protestsProtesters demonstrated in Paris and other French cities throughout much of November and December against a new security law proposed by the government that would have limited the right to share images of on-duty police online. Offenders would face up to one year in prison and a €45,000 ($53,000) fine.The government said the proposal was intended to protect police from retribution and online calls for violence against officers. But critics warned the bill would curtail the right to document police misconduct and undermine the ability of journalists to cover police activity, notably at demonstrations.Reporters without Borders, Amnesty International's France division and journalist unions called for the provision to be withdrawn. The UN’s High Commissioner for Human Rights and France’s own human rights ombudsman also voiced concerns that the provision – Article 25 – threatened fundamental civil rights.The importance of documenting police activity was underscored in late November when Black music producer Michel Zecler was brutally beaten by Paris police hurling racial epithets. Videos of the attack were first published by French website Loopsider but quickly went viral, receiving millions of views. An investigation into the incident is ongoing. “I was lucky enough to have videos, which protected me,” Zecler later said.On November 30 the government backed down, dropping controversial Article 25 and saying that it would be “completely rewritten”.Despite the reversal, almost 100 protests took place throughout France on December 5. In some cities, demonstrators clashed with police as vehicles were set on fire and shop windows were smashed. More than 140 people were arrested at protests the following week and police used water cannon to disperse crowds.",
    "An invisible foe indifferent to man-made borders, the world's greatest pandemic in a century triggered fear, anxiety, and sometimes the worst but also the best in humanity. In Italy and elsewhere, we clapped for care workers who appropriately bore the name of front-line workers, heading into battle desperately short of protective equipment and all too often sacrificing their own lives.In March, Prime Minister Narendra Modi suddenly announced a lockdown, forcing migrant workers, many of them day labourers, to travel across the country to their home states in what some described as the country's greatest migration since the Partition in 1947.When the virus struck, local authorities played down the danger in China. Angry citizens demanded answers –particularly when a 33-year-old front-line doctor was detained for doubting the statistics. When Li Wenliang himself succumbed to Covid-19 in early February, they were even more outraged.The unprecedented pandemic led up to an unprecedented US election. Record turnout, thanks in no small part to mail-in and early voting campaigns that went into overdrive for health reasons, saw Democrats Joe Biden and Kamala Harris beat President Donald Trump by 7 million ballots. But the Republican candidate also outperformed his own showing of just four years ago.With minorities disproportionately affected by Covid-19, built-up rage exploded in late May over the death of 46-year-old George Floyd. His death at the hands of a white Minneapolis police officer – caught on camera – was the result of police being called over a counterfeit $20 bill.As for France, the country found itself revisiting some of the dark themes of 2015. As the trial of suspected accomplices in the Charlie Hebdo attacks began, the satirical weekly republished controversial cartoons of the prophet, prompting a backlash in the Muslim world and fresh attacks on French soil, including a stabbing spree in a Nice cathedral. The most gruesome attack was the beheading of middle-school teacher Samuel Paty, who was murdered by an 18-year-old Chechen who was angered that Paty had shown students the Mohammed caricatures as part of a class on free speech.Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and French President Emmanuel Macron had a war of words in 2020, with Erdogan flexing muscle on the world stage by deploying troops to Libya and gunboats to the oil- and gas-rich waters of the eastern Mediterranean. In the conflict over the disputed enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh, Erdogan backed Azerbaijan and Russia stepped in to broker a truce that required Armenia accepting Azerbaijani gains in the region – but retreating Armenians razed their own homes as they ceded territory.Produced by Alessandro Xenos, Juliette Laurain and Imen Mellaz.",
    "French Prime Minister Jean Castex said Thursday that the government would review the wording of a controversial draft law that would place restrictions on citizens filming the police and publishing the images.In the wake of a new scandal over police brutality that has led to fresh pressure to backtrack, Castex announced that he was going to set up \"an independent commission with responsibility for proposing a new wording for Article 24.\"Article 24 of the \"Comprehensive Security\" law, passed during a first reading by the lower house of parliament on Tuesday, would criminalise the publication of images of on-duty police officers with the intent of harming their \"physical or psychological integrity\".Media groups in France, including AFP, have raised alarm about the possible impact on journalists covering police operations, while other critics say the wording is intended to dissuade citizens from videoing police and holding them accountable.The law has led French and UN rights experts as well as the European Union to express concern about its possible impact, while thousands of protesters have already made their opposition clear in street protests.Supporters of the law, above all Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin, say it is necessary to protect the identity of law enforcement officers who are at risk of harassment, threats and violence.Mobile phone footage of police brutality has played a key role in recent scandals in France, as well as in the global uproar over the death of George Floyd during his arrest in the United States in May.On Thursday, video images of three police officers beating a black music producer inside his studio in Paris caused an outcry that saw politicians, footballers and millions of social media users express their disgust.After clearing the lower house, the draft security law would now need to be approved by the Senate. Some experts believe it could also face censure from France's constitutional court.(AFP)",
    "French lawmakers on Tuesday began debating a bill that could ban dissemination of images of police officers' faces, triggering protests in Paris and other French cities against the potential loss of a check against abuses of power.France's security forces have long faced accusations of using brutal tactics when dealing with protesters, but also when confronting or arresting individuals, in particular from black or Arab minorities.And now, Macron’s centrist government has proposed a new \"comprehensive security\" law that would institute reforms such as giving more autonomy to local police -- and potentially arming more of them -- and expanding the use of surveillance drones in high-crime areas.Under the law, which would apply to civilians and journalists alike, it would be a crime to show images of an officer's face unless it has been blurred. Publication on social media or elsewhere with the intent of undermining an officer's \"physical or psychological integrity\" could be punished by a year in prison or fines of up to 45,000 euros ($53,000).Journalists and rights groups oppose the measure and took to the streets as lawmakers began their debate, joined by Yellow Vest protesters and victims of police violence. Demonstrations took place in Paris, Bordeaux, Lyon, Grenoble, Marseille and in other French cities.Read more: French bill banning images of police worries activists and journalistsIn Paris, police fired water cannons and tear gas near the National Assembly, the parliament, when a number of young protesters started damaging property toward the end of a rally that had been peaceful.Journalists and rights activists say the stricter rules would effectively work as a \"gag law\" similar to a measure in force in Spain since 2015, that would hinder attempts to hold police accountable.Calls for reformA series of incidents caught on video and spread on social media have spurred calls for reform, which gained momentum this year with the \"Black Lives Matter\" movement in the US following the death of George Floyd.But police say they are increasingly under personal threat as they struggle to carry out President Emmanuel Macron's promise to reduce crime and insecurity, especially in the poorer suburbs surrounding Paris and other cities.An attack on a police station outside Paris last month by dozens of people armed with fireworks and steel bars galvanised the government to pass concrete measures protecting officers and improve working conditions.Interior Minister Gérald Darmanin said the measure would \"protect those who are protecting us\", especially in poorer neighbourhoods where tensions often run high between law enforcement and immigrant communities.The bill's co-author Jean-Michel Fauvergue, a former head of France's elite RAID police unit, rejected claims that police were getting new protections from criticism.\"In no way does this stop journalists from working,\" Fauvergue said at a press conference on Tuesday.He said the law would only punish publication of an officer's face \"with messages calling for hate or violence\".But the UN Human Rights Council warned that the proposal \"could discourage, even punish those who could supply elements of potential human rights violations by law enforcement, and provide a sort of immunity\".Critics point in particular to the hundreds of violence complaints filed against officers during the \"yellow vest\" anti-government rallies that erupted in 2018, which saw fierce clashes between protesters and police that made headlines worldwide.In July, three officers were charged with manslaughter over the death of a delivery man, Cédric Chouviat, who was filmed by bystanders as officers had him in a chokehold after his arrest for a traffic offence in Paris.Chouviat said \"I'm suffocating\" seven times before his body went limp.\"Black Lives Matter\" also fuelled mass protests this summer against alleged police violence in France, particularly over the 2016 death in custody of a 24-year-old black man, Adama Traoré.France's human rights auditor has also warned of \"considerable risks\" from the new law.\"The publication of images regarding police interventions are legitimate and necessary for a democracy to function,\" said the auditor.(FRANCE 24 with AFP)Answer a few questions to join Europe Talks and debate with another European",
    "The former Minneapolis police officer charged with murder in the death of George Floyd posted bail Wednesday and was released from jail, leading Minnesota’s governor to activate the National Guard to help keep the peace in the event of protests.According to court documents, Derek Chauvin  posted a $1 million bond and was released from the state’s facility in Oak Park Heights, where he had been detained. Hennepin County jail records show he was released shortly before 11:30 a.m.Floyd, a Black man in handcuffs, died May 25 after Chauvin, who is white, pressed his knee against Floyd’s neck for several minutes as Floyd said he couldn’t breathe. Floyd’s death was captured in widely seen bystander video that set off protests around the world. Chauvin and three other officers were fired. Chauvin is charged with second-degree murder, third-degree murder and manslaughter; Thomas Lane, J. Kueng and Tou Thao are charged with aiding and abetting both second-degree murder and manslaughter.Upon news of Chauvin’s release, Gov. Tim Walz activated the National Guard to help local law enforcement. Walz said the Guard was mobilizing 100 soldiers and providing equipment and facilities “out of an abundance of caution” in light of public safety concerns. Walz said 100 state troopers and 75 Department of Natural Resources conservation officers were also mobilized to help local authorities.As darkness fell Wednesday evening, hundreds of people took to the streets in south Minneapolis where protests were centered in the days after George Floyd’s death. They marched several blocks and blocked an intersection for a time, with chants including, “No Justice, No Peace — Prosecute the Police.”Floyd family attorneys Ben Crump and Antonio Romanucci released a statement saying Chauvin’s release “is a painful reminder” that the family is far from getting justice.“The system of due process worked for Chauvin and afforded him his freedom while he awaits trial. In contrast, George Floyd was denied due process, when his life was ended over a $20 bill. There was no charge, no arrest, no hearing, no bail. Just execution,” the attorneys wrote.Floyd’s aunt, Angela Harrelson, told FOX-9 that she was still trying to process the news.“It’s something that I’m not happy with. I’m not pleased with it. But I know I have to accept it because this is what the judge allowed to happen. ... I know our family is not happy with this decision,” Harrelson said.Questions raisedIt was not immediately clear where Chauvin got the money to pay his bond. In Minnesota, someone who posts bond is required to pay 10%, in this case $100,000, to the bail bond company. Then, the company and the defendant work out an arrangement for collateral to back all or part of the rest of the bond amount, said Mike Brandt, a criminal defense attorney who is not connected to the case.A message left with the company that posted the bond, Allegheny Casualty Company, was not immediately returned.The Minnesota Police and Peace Officers Association, which has a legal defense fund, did not provide any money for bail, a spokeswoman said. Bob Kroll, president of the Minneapolis Police Officers Federation, said his union was not involved.The website GiveSendGo.com, which says it is a free Christian crowdfunding site, has a Derek Chauvin Bail Fund that says it was created by his family. According to the site, as of midday Wednesday that fund raised $4,198 of its $125,000 goal, with donations from more than 35 people. A posting on the site dated Sept. 12 said it took time to set up a fundraising effort due to the high-profile nature of the case.Chauvin had the option of posting bail for $1.25 million without conditions or $1 million with conditions. Under the conditions of his release, he must attend all court appearances, cannot have any direct or indirect contact — including social media contact — with any members of Floyd’s family, cannot work in law enforcement or security, and must not possess any firearms or ammunition.Chauvin’s attorney had no comment Wednesday.Chauvin’s wife, Kellie Chauvin, filed for divorce shortly after Floyd’s death. The records in that case have since been sealed and Kellie Chauvin’s divorce attorney didn’t immediately reply to a message seeking comment.In July, the Chauvins were charged with multiple felony counts of tax evasion for allegedly failing to report income from various jobs, including more than $95,000 from Derek Chauvin’s off-duty security work. The criminal complaints in that case allege that from 2014 through 2019, the Chauvins underreported their joint income by $464,433 and owe the state $37,868 in unpaid taxes, interest and fees.The tax evasion case also listed other assets, including the couple’s second home in Florida and a $100,000 BMW.The Chauvin home in the St. Paul suburb of Oakdale was sold on Aug. 28 for $279,000, which was $26,000 less than the price it was listed at a month after Floyd’s death, according to online real estate records. It was not clear where Chauvin was staying after his release, but one of the conditions of his bail was that he not leave Minnesota without permission.The other three officers charged in Floyd’s death had previously posted bond amounts of $750,000 and have been free pending trial. Currently, all four men are scheduled to face trial together in March, but the judge is weighing a request to have them tried separately.(AP)",
    "Relatives of Breonna Taylor, a black woman killed in a police shooting in her own home, announced Tuesday they have settled their wrongful death suit with the US city of Louisville for $12 million, as well as promises of local law enforcement reforms.The civil settlement was substantial and relatively quick, reflecting the public pressure and emotion surrounding the case of the 26-year-old, which became a rallying cry for the Black Lives Matter movement.After Taylor's death on March 13, another black citizen, George Floyd, died on May 25 in Minneapolis while a police officer knelt on his neck, sparking protests across the country against racism and police brutality.Taylor family attorney Ben Crump called the $12 million settlement \"historic\" but said the \"comprehensive reform\" plan was \"equally important.\"Authorities in Louisville and the state of Kentucky pledged to implement measures that might head off incidents similar to the botched raid in which Taylor was killed.Those include more oversight from commanding officers about search warrants, the hiring of a team of social workers, and encouraging officers to do community service.Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer said the city \"is not waiting to move ahead with needed reforming to prevent the tragedy like this from ever happening again.\"Taylor was killed when three plainclothes police officers executing a \"no knock\" search warrant burst into her apartment late at night.Taylor's boyfriend, who was in bed with her, grabbed a gun and exchanged fire with the officers. He later said he thought they were criminals.The officers, who had not activated their body cameras as required, shot Taylor eight times, killing her. A police sergeant was also wounded.The agreement signals an end to the civil proceedings but not to the criminal investigation, which has yet to lead to any charges, six months after Taylor's death.The three said they had announced themselves before entering. They later filed an after-action report that was found to be rife with errors.The raid was carried out simultaneously with a handful of others targeting Taylor's ex-boyfriend, an alleged narcotics dealer.

    "A white, 17-year-old police admirer was arrested Wednesday in the killing of two people gunned down during a third night of protests in Kenosha over the police shooting of a Black man, Jacob Blake.Kyle Rittenhouse, of Antioch, Illinois, about 15 miles from Kenosha, was taken into custody in Illinois on suspicion of first-degree intentional homicide in the attack Tuesday that was largely captured on cellphone video. The shooting left a third person wounded.“I just killed somebody,” the gunman, carrying a semi-automatic rifle, could be heard saying at one point during the rampage that erupted just before midnight in the city of 100,000 people midway between Milwaukee and Chicago.In the wake of the killings, Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers authorized the deployment of 500 members of the National Guard to Kenosha, doubling the number of troops. The governor’s office said he is working with other states to bring in additional National Guard members and law officers. Authorities also announced a 7 p.m. curfew, an hour earlier than the night before.“A senseless tragedy like this cannot happen again,” the governor, a Democrat, said in a statement. “I again ask those who choose to exercise their First Amendment rights please do so peacefully and safely, as so many did last night. I also ask the individuals who are not there to exercise those rights to please stay home and let local first responders, law enforcement and members of the Wisconsin National Guard do their jobs.”In Washington, the Justice Department said it is sending in more than 200 federal agents from the FBI, U.S. Marshals Service and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives in response to the unrest. The White House said up to 2,000 National Guard troops would be made available.And in Orlando, Florida, the NBA’s Milwaukee Bucks didn’t take the floor for their playoff game against the Magic. It was later announced that all three NBA playoff games scheduled for Wednesday were postponed, with players around the league choosing to boycott in their strongest statement yet against racial injustice.>> Top NBA and MLB teams go on strike against racism, forcing leagues to cancel gamesThe dead were identified only as a 26-year-old Silver Lake, Wisconsin, resident and a 36-year-old from Kenosha. The wounded person, a 36-year-old from West Allis, Wisconsin, was expected to survive, police said.“We were all chanting ‘Black lives matter’ at the gas station and then we heard, boom, boom, and I told my friend, ‘‘That’s not fireworks,’” 19-year-old protester Devin Scott told the Chicago Tribune. “And then this guy with this huge gun runs by us in the middle of the street and people are yelling, ‘He shot someone! He shot someone!’ And everyone is trying to fight the guy, chasing him and then he started shooting again.”Scott said he cradled a lifeless victim in his arms, and a woman started performing CPR, but “I don’t think he made it.”According to witness accounts and video footage, police apparently let the gunman walk past them and leave the scene with a rifle over his shoulder and his hands in the air as members of the crowd were yelling for him to be arrested because he had shot people.As for how the gunman managed to slip away, Sheriff David Beth depicted a chaotic, high-stress scene, with lots of radio traffic and people screaming, chanting and running — conditions he said can cause “tunnel vision” among law officers.Rittenhouse was assigned a public defender in Illinois for a hearing Friday on his transfer to Wisconsin. The public defender’s office had no comment. Under Wisconsin law, anyone 17 or older is treated as an adult in the criminal justice system.Much of Rittenhouse’s Facebook page is devoted to praising law enforcement, with references to Blue Lives Matter, a movement that supports police. He also can be seen holding an assault rifle.Other photographs include those of badges of various law enforcement agencies, including the Chicago Police Department. All of the badges have a black line across them — something police officers typically do with black tape when an officer is killed in the line of duty.In a photograph posted by his mother, he is wearing what appears to be a blue law enforcement uniform as well as the kind of brimmed hat that state troopers wear.The sheriff told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that militia members or armed vigilantes had been patrolling Kenosha’s streets in recent nights, but he did not know if the gunman was among them. However, video taken before the shooting shows police tossing bottled water from an armored vehicle to what appear to be armed civilians walking the streets. And one of them appears to be the gunman.“We appreciate you being here,” an officer is heard saying to the group over a loudspeaker.Before the shooting, the conservative website The Daily Caller conducted a video interview with the suspected gunman in front of a boarded-up business.“So people are getting injured, and our job is to protect this business,” the young man said. “And part of my job is to also help people. If there is somebody hurt, I’m running into harm’s way. That’s why I have my rifle—because I can protect myself, obviously. But I also have my med kit.”Sam Dirks, 22, from Milwaukee, said he had seen the gunman earlier in the evening, and he was yelling at some of the protesters. “He was definitely very agitated. He was pacing around, just pointing his gun in general. Not necessarily at anyone specifically,” Dirks said.Wisconsin Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes, who is Black, said in an interview with the news program “Democracy Now!” that the shootings were not surprising and that white militias have been ignored for too long.“How many times across this country do you see armed gunmen, protesting, walking into state Capitols, and everybody just thinks it’s OK?” Barnes said. “People treat that like it’s some kind of normal activity that people are walking around with assault rifles.”In Wisconsin, it is legal for people 18 and over to openly carry a gun, with no license required.Witness accounts and video indicate the shootings took place in two stages: The gunman first shot someone at a car lot, then jogged away, fell in the street, and opened fire again as members of the crowd closed in on him.A witness, Julio Rosas, 24, said that when the gunman stumbled, “two people jumped onto him and there was a struggle for control of his rifle. At that point during the struggle, he just began to fire multiple rounds, and that dispersed people near him.”“The rifle was being jerked around in all directions while it was being fired,” Rosas said.Blake, 29, was shot in the back seven times on Sunday as he leaned into his SUV, three of his children seated inside. Kenosha police have said little about what happened other than that they were responding to a domestic dispute.The officer who shot Blake was identified by state authorities as Rusten Sheskey, a seven-year veteran of the Kenosha Police Department. Sheskey shot Blake while holding onto his shirt after officers first unsuccessfully used a Taser, the Wisconsin Justice Department said.State agents later recovered a knife from the driver’s side floorboard of the vehicle, authorities said.No charges were announced, and state officials continue to investigate.On Tuesday, Ben Crump, the lawyer for Blake’s family, said it would “take a miracle” for Blake to walk again. He called for the officer who opened fire to be arrested and for the others involved to lose their jobs.'It is going to take a miracle for Jacob Blake junior to ever walk again,' said civil rights attorney Ben Crump, who is representing Jacob Blake's family https://t.co/dgCQDccKFz pic.twitter.com/BqAxQIse63The shooting was captured on cellphone video and ignited new protests in the U.S. three months after the death of George Floyd under the knee of a Minneapolis police officer touched off a nationwide reckoning over racial injustice.Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden posted a video saying he had spoken with Blake’s parents and other family members.“What I saw on that video makes me sick,” Biden said. “Once again, a Black man, Jacob Blake, has been shot by the police in broad daylight, with the whole world watching.”(AP)The shooting was captured on cellphone video and ignited new protests in the U.S. three months after the death of George Floyd under the knee of a Minneapolis police officer touched off a nationwide reckoning over racial injustice.Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden posted a video saying he had spoken with Blake’s parents and other family members.“What I saw on that video makes me sick,” Biden said. “Once again, a Black man, Jacob Blake, has been shot by the police in broad daylight, with the whole world watching.”",
    "Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers declared a state of emergency, saying he would deploy more state National Guard troops, as the city of Kenosha braced for a third night of unrest following the shooting of a Black man by police.Evers said he would authorize an increase in the Wisconsin National Guard's presence - more than 100 members were deployed on Monday - to 250. The move came as other officials called for a more forceful response after a night of looting and arson overshadowed peaceful protesters on the streets.We are assessing the damage to state property and will be increasing the presence of the Wisconsin National Guard to ensure individuals can exercise their right safely, protect state buildings and critical infrastructure, and support first responders and fire fighters.\"Essentially, our city was burned to the ground, building by building,\" Kenosha County Board of Supervisors member Zach Rodriguez told Reuters. \"Enough is enough.\" Rodriguez said the board would hold an emergency meeting on Tuesday on seeking federal help because of concerns the governor was not doing enough.Officials were preparing for a repeat of Monday night when smoke billowed over central Kenosha and police in riot gear clashed with protesters who defied a dusk-to-dawn curfew amid outrage over the shooting of Jacob Blake, 29, on Sunday afternoon.Blake, who had been attempting to break up a fight between two women, was struck by four of the seven shots, all fired by one officer, in front of his sons aged 3, 5 and 8, civil rights attorney Ben Crump, who represents the Blake family, told ABC News on Tuesday.Video captured by a neighbor shows Blake walking toward the driver's side door of his SUV, away from two officers who were pointing guns at his back.

Kenosha police have referred all questions to the state investigators.But the incident, the latest in a litany of cases to focus attention on police treatment of African Americans, unleashed outrage in Kenosha, a Lake Michigan city of about 100,000 people located between Chicago and Milwaukee.The shooting occurred three months after George Floyd's death in Minneapolis sparked nationwide protests against police brutality and racism.Clyde McLemore, president of the Black Lives Matter chapter in nearby Lake County, Illinois, south of Kenosha, said demonstrators would be out again on Tuesday night, demanding that the officers involved in the shooting, who have been placed on administrative leave, be fired and prosecuted.\"We won't stop protesting until we get that done,\" he said. \"I don’t condone burning of buildings or looting, but I understand it.

    "There has been a sharp rise in the number of black Americans buying firearms and joining gun clubs, according to the National African American Gun Association (NAGAA), purchases attributed to growing anxiety over the Covid-19 crisis and increased racial tensions following the death of George Floyd.NAGAA says its figures shows gun ownership levels among black people has been growing in recent months, with the death of Floyd at the hands of white police officers in May and a subsequent spate of protests a particular driving factor. More than 2,000 people joined the group in the 36 hours after Floyd’s killing.Damon Finch, president of all-black Hudson Valley Nubian Gun Club in New York, says he has also witnessed a similar trend.He started the club earlier this year after noticing a spike in interest in firearms among the black community.\"Initially, we started off with just a couple of people getting together,” he told Reuters.“And then all of a sudden, you start to get all these phone calls from people who were both firearm owners and also people who are looking to get firearms. And I figured, let's get together. Let's create a gun club.“Our membership almost every night is doubling, tripling. It's just amazing how many people are now joining our group.\"First-time gun owners include those who had never previously considered buying a firearm.\"At 61 years, I've not needed it, not ever thought of it. I would say 'Get the guns away. No, no, no!’ But now my views have changed because I guess the world is changing right before our eyes,” first-time gun owner Margaret Powell told Reuters.\"It's like we're going back in time to maybe the Wild, Wild West or something. Everybody has to have a gun.”Some groups, such as Black Guns Matter, have advocated for black gun ownership as a means for self-protection in the wake of Floyd’s killing, the sometimes violent protests that have followed and other reports of police violence against black people.Meanwhile, a newly formed and heavily armed black militia, the Not Fucking Around Coalition, has appeared at some recent protests.\"Self-preservation is universal law. We should be able to protect ourselves,” Gahiji Manderson, a member of the Hudson Valley Nubian Gun Club, told Reuters.“We're not looking for trouble, but to be able to protect ourselves if trouble comes towards our way.\"But it is not just black people buying weapons in growing numbers. Total US gun sales in June were the highest on record with 3.9 million firearms sold, according to figures from the Brookings Institute, in a country where firearms kill nearly 40,000 people a year.",
    "George Floyd said he couldn't breathe more than 20 times, called out for his children and late mother and said officers would \"kill\" him before he died in Minneapolis police custody, new evidence showed.Floyd, a black man, died on May 25 when a white police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes. His death has unleashed a massive wave of protests against systemic racism and police brutality in the United States and inspired demos across the world.Video of his death went viral and showed Floyd shouting \"I can't breathe\" and calling for his mother as he suffocated.But transcripts of the police officers' body camera footage, filed Tuesday in Minnesota state court by Thomas Lane, one of the officers involved in Floyd's death, has revealed new details about his final moments.When the officers first arrested him, Floyd begged them not to put him in the police car, telling them he was claustrophobic and in physical distress.As they tried to force him into the car, Floyd cried out that he couldn't breathe and was \"going to die in here.\"Later, according to the transcript, he said, \"Momma, I love you. Tell my kids I love them. I'm dead.\" He called for his mother and children several more times.Throughout his arrest, Floyd said \"I can't breathe\" more than 20 times. The officers can be heard telling him to \"relax,\" and that he was doing \"fine\" and \"talking fine.\"At one point, as Floyd insisted they were going to kill him, officer Derek Chauvin shouted, \"Then stop talking, stop yelling, it takes a heck of a lot of oxygen to talk.\"'I can't breathe'According to the transcript, Floyd's last words were, \"They're going to kill me. They're going to kill me. I can't breathe.\"The transcript was submitted Tuesday by Lane to have the charges that he aided and abetted in Floyd's murder thrown out by a judge.He and the other three officers involved — Chauvin, Tou Thao and Alexander Kueng — were all fired from the Minneapolis police force one day after Floyd's death and charged in his murder. They each face up to 40 years behind bars.Chauvin, who knelt on the handcuffed 46-year-old's neck, faces second and third-degree murder charges.Thao and Kueng, like Lane, have been charged with aiding and abetting a murder.The bystander video of Floyd's death stunned and horrified Americans, igniting protests and riots in cities across the country and sparking a national debate on racism and police violence.Floyd was detained for the minor charge of attempting to use a counterfeit $20 bill, and while in handcuffs, two of the officers held him down on the street while Chauvin pressed his knee to Floyd's neck and the fourth officer stood watch.(AFP)",
    "Democrats pushed sweeping new police guidelines through the US House on Thursday amid a polarising debate after the high-profile killing of African-American George Floyd sparked nationwide protests and calls for change.The measure, which bans choke holds and no-knock warrants, restricts officer immunity, combats racial profiling and establishes a database to track police misconduct, passed largely along party lines.It sets up a showdown in the Senate where Republican leadership has no intention of passing it.Applause rang out when the bill passed by 236 votes to 181, with three Republicans joining the chamber's Democrats in support.President Donald Trump is opposed to the House measure, and on Tuesday said the Democrats were aiming to \"weaken our police\" and end officer immunity.Instead he backs a narrower, Senate Republican proposal. That measure was blocked by Democrats on Tuesday and there were no signs of new negotiations.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said her chamber's bill is named after George Floyd, whose final words \"I can't breathe\" before his death at the hands of Minneapolis police \"changed the course of history in our nation.\"The legislation \"will fundamentally transform the culture of policing to address systemic racism, curb police brutality and save lives, as it puts an end to shielding police from accountability,\" Pelosi said.\"We don't paint all police with the same brush, but for those who need to be painted with that brush, we need to take the action contained in this bill.\"Pelosi and other Democrats have dismissed the Senate measure because it mimics the words of reform while requiring no specific action.Instead of direct mandates, the Republican proposal would incentivize change by denying federal grants to police departments that do not end choke holds or no-knock warrants.Republicans say their bill would be a good starting point for negotiations. Democrats argue it falls well short, and Pelosi said it would be \"a moral failure to accept anything less than transformational change.\"(AFP)",
    "The United States marks the end of slavery by celebrating Juneteenth on Friday, with the annual unofficial holiday taking on renewed significance as millions of Americans confront the nation's living legacy of racial injustice.Demonstrations, prayers and cultural celebrations of food and music will enliven communities from New York to Los Angeles to honor the day in 1865 when a Union general proclaimed in Galveston, Texas that all slaves were free.Some 155 years after the demise of the pro-slavery Confederacy, several tragedies have led the country into a reckoning on race.They have also energized a quest for equality among African Americans who decry how systemic racism and injustice have been allowed to fester in the world's flagship democracy.Forty-six-year-old African-American George Floyd was killed on May 25 when a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee onto Floyd's neck for nearly nine minutes and ignored multiple pleas of \"I can't breathe.\"Video of the horrific incident triggered coast-to-coast protests against racial injustice and police brutality. Millions took to the streets under the \"Black Lives Matter\" banner.Further fuelling tensions, an officer in Atlanta last week shot dead a black man who was running away after a scuffle with police.Both offending officers in the incidents have been charged with murder, and the killings have spurred US lawmakers to introduce sweeping new police reforms.As Americans grapple with their country's legacy, Juneteenth has the potential to amplify calls for action and reform.Several commemorations have gone virtual to account for the coronavirus pandemic, but many are going ahead as planned or with modifications such as social distancing and mask-wearing guidelines.Protests are scheduled in cities like Tulsa, Oklahoma, which hosts a day-long \"I, Too, Am America\" rally for justice.US President Donald Trump used incendiary language to level criticism at protesters following Floyd's death, and he added fuel to the fire when he scheduled a huge campaign rally on Juneteenth in Tulsa, his first since the pandemic began.Trump faced an outcry over his provocative choice of date and location – Tulsa suffered one of the country's worst racist massacres, in 1921, when as many as 300 black Americans were killed – and he changed the rally to Saturday.Dozens of events Friday throughout New York will mark the holiday, including a march to City Hall demanding \"justice, dignity and equality\" for black Americans.Chicago will host a \"Black Lives Matter Block Party\" featuring voter registration drives.‘Famous’ JuneteenthPressure has mounted for Juneteenth to be declared a national holiday. New York and Virginia have moved to make it an official state holiday.Several major US companies including Nike and Twitter recently announced they were making Juneteenth a paid holiday for employees.Floyd's death has reverberated nationwide. Several monuments depicting Confederate generals or soldiers have been toppled by protesters or ordered removed by local governments.The auto-racing series NASCAR banned Confederate flags at its events.And in the US Capitol, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ordered the removal Thursday of four statues of 19th century lawmakers who served in the Confederacy.Despite the progress made with the civil rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s, America's black minority – about 13 percent of the population – has struggled.Black household wealth is a fraction of that of whites, their health care outcomes are poorer, they are under-represented in US politics, and are jailed at far higher rates than whites in an era of mass incarceration.As Juneteenth approached, Trump insisted he delayed his rally to June 20 out of respect.\"Nobody had ever heard of it,\" Trump claimed in a Wall Street Journal interview Thursday, apparently oblivious that his White House annually releases a statement commemorating the day.\"I did something good,\" he added. \"I made Juneteenth very famous.\"(AFP)",
    "African countries called Friday on the UN Human Rights Council to urgently debate racism and police brutality in the wake of the global protests that followed George Floyd's killing by an officer in the US.In a letter written on behalf of 54 African countries, Burkina Faso's ambassador to the UN in Geneva asked the UN's top rights body for an \"urgent debate\" on \"racially inspired human rights violations, police brutality against people of African descent and the violence against the peaceful protests that call for these injustices to stop.\"The letter, addressed to rights council president Elisabeth Tichy-Fisslberger of Austria, requested that this debate be held next week, when the council's 43rd session resumes, after it was interrupted in March due to the COVID-19 pandemic.It pointed to the case of George Floyd, a 46-year-old black man who died in police custody in Minneapolis on May 25 after a white officer, who has since been charged with murder, pressed his knee on his neck for nearly nine minutes.The call came after Floyd's family, along with the families of other victims of police violence and over 600 NGOs this week called on the council to urgently address systemic racism and police impunity in the US.For the council to consider such a request, it needs to have the backing of at least one country.With the request now coming from a large group of states, \"that increases the chances\" it will take place, a council spokesman told AFP.'Unchecked police brutality'Floyd's death, which was caught on video and has sparked massive protests across the United States and around the world, \"is unfortunately not an isolated incident, with many previous cases of unarmed persons of African descent suffering the same fate due to unchecked police brutality,\" the letter said.\"Sadly, the fates of many other victims attracted no attention, as they were not captured on social media for all to see,\" Ambassador Dieudonne Desire Sougouri wrote on behalf of the African Group at the council.While the letter called for a debate on racism around the globe, it in particular highlighted the situation in the United States.\"The protests the world is witnessing are a rejection of the fundamental racial inequality and discrimination that characterise life in the United States for black people, and other people of colour,\" it said.>> ‘Black and treated as such’: France’s anti-racism protests expose myth of colour-blind RepublicA number of countries are expected to address Floyd's killing and concerns about police violence and racism in the United States during the resumed 43rd council session even without a special debate.But since the deadline for tabling fresh resolutions during this session expired back in March, they will only be able to call for concrete actions within the confines of this extraordinary debate.John Fisher, head of the Human Rights Watch's Geneva office, voiced hope earlier Friday, before the African Group letter went out, that the council would order some form of scrutiny of the US situation.\"There are underlying issues of systemic racism that need to be addressed and addressed meaningfully,\" he told journalists.(FRANCE 24 with AFP)",
    "The Minneapolis Police Department will withdraw from police union contract negotiations, Chief Medaria Arradondo said Wednesday as he announced the first steps in what he claimed would be transformational reforms to the agency in the wake of George Floyd's death.Arradondo said a thorough review of the contract is planned since it needs to be restructured to provide more transparency and flexibility for true reform.The decision to cut off negotiations with the Police Officers Federation of Minneapolis came days after a majority of the city council pledged to dismantle the police force, raising pressure on the chief to take action.Arradondo said it was debilitating for a chief when there are grounds to terminate an officer's services and a third-party mechanism works to keep that person on the job.“This work must be transformational, but I must do it right,” Arradondo said of changes to the department.He also promised new research and strategies to spot and intervene with problem officers.“We will have a police department that our communities view as legitimate, trusting and working with their best interests at heart,” he said, adding that the department has to address issues of racism head-on.Arradondo sidestepped a question about whether he thought union head Bob Kroll, often seen as an obstacle to reform, should step down.Unions resistant to reformPolice unions in the US are widely viewed as resistant to reform efforts. Critics say their mandate to protect the interests of their members often overrides the interests of democratic norms and the integrity of police departments.A review in the journal Police Practice and Research noted that, “Virtually all of the published items that express an opinion on the impact of police unions regard them as having a negative effect, particularly on innovation, accountability, and police — community relations.”Floyd died on May 25 after Officer Derek Chauvin pressed his knee into Floyd’s neck, ignoring the handcuffed black man’s “I can’t breathe” cries and staying there even after Floyd stopped moving.Chauvin — a white officer who had 17 complaints against him and was only disciplined once — is charged with second-degree murder, third-degree murder and manslaughter. Three other officers at the scene are charged with aiding and abetting the second-degree murder and manslaughter counts.'Stop the pain,' Floyd's brother tells CongressArradondo's announcement came as Philonise Floyd challenged Congress on Wednesday to “stop the pain\" so that his brother George wouldn't be just \"another name” on a growing list of those killed during interactions with police.Floyd's appearance before a House hearing came a day after funeral services for his bother, whose death has become a worldwide symbol in demonstrations over calls for changes to police practices and an end to racial prejudices.“I’m here today to ask you to make it stop. Stop the pain,” Philonise Floyd told the silenced hearing room.Choking back tears, he said he wants to make sure that his brother, whom he called “Perry” is “more than another face on a T-shirt. More than another name on a list that won’t stop growing”.Floyd directly challenged lawmakers to step up. \"The people marching in the streets are telling you enough is enough. Be the leaders that this country, this world, needs. Do the right thing.”House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler gaveled in the session as Democrats review the Justice in Policing Act, a far-ranging package of proposals amid a national debate on policing and racial inequity in the US.(FRANCE 24 with AP and REUTERS)"
